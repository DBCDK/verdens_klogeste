She was educated at  Geelong Grammar School and the University of Melbourne, where she studied law.[8]

In April 2017, in season six, de Rossi's character, Elizabeth North, was killed off by a golf club attack. De Rossi herself made the decision to depart the Scandal series, saying, "I am incredibly grateful for my time here at Scandal. I will miss playing Elizabeth North but I've made the decision to focus on a business opportunity. Shonda, Betsy and the cast have been incredibly supportive of my decision.
