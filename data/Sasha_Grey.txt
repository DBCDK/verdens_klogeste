Grey attended four high schools – including Highlands High in Sacramento, California  – and was unhappy in each one,[1] though she graduated a year early at the age of 17.[21] In late 2005, she attended Sacramento City College and took classes in film, dance, and acting.[22] She bussed tables at a Black Angus steakhouse until March 2006 and saved $7,000 for a move to Los Angeles.[1]
In May 2006, Sasha Grey moved to Los Angeles, California, and performed in hardcore pornography.[23] She considered calling herself Anna Karina,[1] after the French New Wave actress of the same name, before choosing Sasha Grey; "Sasha" was taken from Sascha Konietzko of the band KMFDM,[24] and "Grey" comes from Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray[25] or the Kinsey scale, a measurement of homosexual and heterosexual attraction.[26][27]
Grey's first scene was an orgy with Rocco Siffredi for Fashionistas Safado: The Challenge by John Stagliano. Grey quickly made a name for herself in the adult film industry after she asked Siffredi to punch her in the stomach; she later stated she was improvising.[28] In January 2007, Grey was the recipient of awards for "Best Three Way Sex Scene" in Fuck Slaves and "Best Group Scene" in Fashionistas Safado: The Challenge at the 24th AVN Adult Movie Awards.[29] In 2008, she became the youngest woman to win the AVN Female Performer of the Year Award award.[30] She also won in the category "Best Oral Sex Scene" for Babysitters at the 25th AVN Awards.[31] Grey starred in Dave Navarro's film Broken, for which she won the AVN Best High End All-Sex Release award.[32][33] In 2008 Grey announced that she would represent herself in the adult industry through her agency L.A.

There was speculation the show was heavily manipulated through editing and did not include her defense of adult film as a career choice.
