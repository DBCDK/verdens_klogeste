Pharrell Lanscilo Williams[1] (/fəˈrɛl/; born April 5, 1973) is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, record producer, fashion designer, and entrepreneur. Williams and Chad Hugo formed the record production duo The Neptunes in 1994,[2] producing hip hop and R&B music. He is the lead vocalist of the band N*E*R*D, which he formed with Hugo and childhood friend Shay Haley. Williams also owns I Am Other, a multimedia creative collective that serves as an umbrella for all of Pharrell Williams' endeavors, including Billionaire Boys Club.
Williams released his first solo single, "Frontin'", in 2003 and followed it with his debut solo album, In My Mind, in 2006.[4] His second album, Girl, was released in March 2014[5][6] and included the commercially successful single "Happy". As part of the Neptunes, Williams has produced numerous singles for various recording artists.[7] Williams featured on Daft Punk's "Get Lucky" which reached the top ten in the music charts of over 32 countries, and has sold more than 9.3 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. The song won Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 56th Grammy Awards.[8]
Williams has received numerous accolades and nominations; he has won 13 Grammy Awards, including three as Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (one came as a member of The Neptunes). He is also a two-time Academy Award nominee, receiving a 2014 Best Original Song nomination for "Happy" (which was featured in Despicable Me 2) and a 2017 Best Picture nomination as one of the producers of Hidden Figures.
Pharrell Lanscilo Williams was born on April 5, 1973, in Virginia Beach, Virginia,[9][10] the oldest of three sons of Pharaoh Williams, a handyman, and his wife Carolyn, a teacher.[11] His roots extend for generations in Virginia and North Carolina, and one of his ancestors journeyed to West Africa in 1831, prompting other relatives to emigrate from America to Liberia in 1832.[12]
He met Chad Hugo in a seventh-grade summer band camp where Williams played the keyboards and drums and Hugo played tenor saxophone. They were also both members of a marching band; Williams played the snare drum while Hugo was drum major.[13][14] Williams and Hugo attended Princess Anne High School where he played in the school band; there Pharrell got the name Skateboard P.[15] Hugo attended Kempsville High School. In the MTV show When I Was 17, Pharrell stated that he was a nerd and often did things that made him stand out from most of his peers.[16]  Williams attended Northwestern University for two years before dropping out.[17]
In the early 1990s, Hugo and Williams formed a four-piece "R&B-type" group, the Neptunes, with friends Shay Haley and Mike Etheridge. They later entered a high school talent show where they were discovered by Teddy Riley, whose studio was next to Princess Anne High School.[18] After graduating from high school, the group signed with Riley.[19]
Through working with Riley, Williams went on to write a verse and help produce for Wreckx-N-Effect's 1992 hit "Rump Shaker".[20] That same year, he also performed a small rap solo on SWV's second hit, "Right Here (UK Remix)". Williams and Hugo met rap duo Clipse in Virginia Beach in 1993, where they later signed to Arista Records through Williams' Star Trak Entertainment imprint in 2002.[21][22] In 1994, Hugo and Williams had established themselves as a production duo under their old name "The Neptunes", and assistant-produced "Tonight's The Night" from Blackstreet's self-titled album. Over the next three years they continued to produce occasionally, and some of the results had little resemblance to the Neptunes' sound later. However, some like Mase's 1997 song "Lookin' at Me" from his album Harlem World, and the most definite beginning of the distinctive "Neptunes sound", came with N.O.R.E's "Superthug" in 1998, reaching number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, and gaining them widespread attention for the first time.
In 2000, they produced the song "I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)" (featuring a chorus by Pharrell himself) for Jay Z's album The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which released as the album's first single.   The song's sound and success sparked the interest of maturing pop artist
Britney Spears.[citation needed]
In 2001, Britney Spears released her album Britney featuring the lead single "I'm a Slave 4 U", which was produced by The Neptunes.   
The song was a defining hit in both of their careers, and it was The Neptunes' first time having helped create an album that debuted number one in the Billboard 200.[23] 
The same year, N*E*R*D, consisting of Williams, Hugo and Haley, released their first album, In Search of..., in Europe, where the first Kelis album was better received. The album sounded very much like their previous production work; the group decided that they should make their work as N*E*R*D sound different, and re-recorded the album with the rock band Spymob.[citation needed]
Then in 2002 their re-produced album was released worldwide, and the Neptunes reached number one in the U.S. with Nelly's single, "Hot in Herre". In August of the same year, the Neptunes were named "Producers of the Year" at both the Source Awards and the Billboard Music Awards. Clipse released their commercial debut album Lord Willin' in August 2002. The album started at number one on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number four on the Billboard 200, fueled by its first two singles, "Grindin'" and "When the Last Time", which peaked at number 34 and number 19 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100.[citation needed]
The Neptunes released a self-credited album called The Neptunes Present... Clones in 2003, with songs and remixes from various artists. This topped the U.S. Billboard 200 Albums Chart. The Neptunes and Williams specifically were also kept in public eye largely due to ties with Jay Z, producing several hit singles for him and two tracks on his The Black Album. The track "Frontin'" was a big hit (the 34th biggest of 2003 according to Billboard). A survey in August 2003 found the Neptunes produced almost 20 percent of songs played on British radio at the time, a survey in the US had them at 43 percent.[13] The same year, the Neptunes remixed the Daft Punk song "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" for the duo's poorly received remix album Daft Club.  The track also had a brief rap section performed by Williams.[24]
N*E*R*D's second funk rock-oriented album, Fly or Die, released in March 2004. Williams's rock credentials were further bolstered by his appearance at the 2004 Grammy Awards, performing the Beatles's "I Saw Her Standing There" on drums with Sting, Dave Matthews, and Vince Gill. Williams received two Grammy Awards that night, one for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, and another for Best Pop Vocal Album for his work on Justin Timberlake's hit album Justified. They also gained their first UK number one, again with Nelly, and "Flap Your Wings".[citation needed]
In September 2004, Williams was featured on the Snoop Dogg single "Drop It Like It's Hot." The song would eventually peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 two months later, marking Williams's first number one single in the United States. The song was named "Rap Song of the Decade" by Billboard in 2009.[25]
In November 2004, Gwen Stefani released her first debut studio album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. which featured the song Hollaback Girl, which was also produced by The Neptunes.  "Hollaback Girl" entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 82 on the issue dated April 2, 2005,[26] and within six weeks of its release, it had reached the top of the chart,[27] becoming Stefani's first US number one.
On September 9, 2005, Williams performed the opening single from his first solo album In My Mind, "Can I Have It Like That", featuring Gwen Stefani. The single did poorly in the US, reaching only number 48. It fared better in the UK, reaching number three. Between then and the July 25, 2006 release of In My Mind, he released "Angel" (in Europe only), and later "Number One" with Kanye West. Several songs leaked to the internet before the album release, most notably "Mamacita" featuring Daddy Yankee, which was subsequently cut from the final version. "That Girl" featuring Snoop Dogg was the final single.[citation needed]
In 2006, the Neptunes produced Clipse's second album Hell Hath No Fury. Most critics labeled the album the Neptunes best production in years, and put the duo back in the charts.[28] A year later, Williams collaborated with Madonna, on the song "Hey You", which was available for download on the MSN website. 25 cents for each of the first one million downloads was donated to the Alliance for Climate Protection, in support of Live Earth.[29] Later that year, Williams performed songs at the Concert for Diana on July 1, 2007. On July 7, he performed at the Brazilian leg of Live Earth in Rio de Janeiro.
A remix album of Williams's solo debut, In My Mind, titled Out of My Mind, was recorded with his newly formed band "The Yessirs" featuring Questlove of the Roots, and was produced by Questlove and keyboardist James Poyser. However, Williams's record label Interscope Records did not think that the album would sell well and subsequently was shelved.[30] The album has built up a strong fanbase asking for its release. The tracks started appearing on Questlove's MySpace, and with every 10,000 plays, a new song was made available. As of July 4, 2007, the full CD has leaked onto the internet along with two songs not featured on In My Mind:  a remix of "Mamacita" and "Creamsickle".[citation needed]
Williams produced Beyoncé's version of "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". He then wrote the Neptunes-produced "Why Should I Be Sad" on Britney Spears' fifth studio album, Blackout.
