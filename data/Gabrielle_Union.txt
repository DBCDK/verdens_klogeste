Gabrielle Union was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the daughter of Theresa (née Glass), a phone company manager and social worker, and Sylvester E. Union, a military sergeant.[2][3] She was raised Roman Catholic.[4] During her childhood, she was taught to be "an independent woman, standing on my own two feet, and that's the road I opted to take."[5] According to Union, her mother taught her to have a "world perspective" and took her to a gay pride parade at the age of eight after the family moved to Pleasanton, California,[6] where she attended Foothill High School.[7]
Her parents divorced after thirty years of marriage. Union has said, "They handled their divorce and our subsequent transition into a blended family with grace and dignity and respect. They always put us first and didn't involve us. I'm lucky that I can just mirror what my parents did and always put the kids first. They're pretty awesome. I'm lucky."[8]
Union grew up with self-esteem issues relating to her appearance, as she believed growing up that "blonde was the ideal of beauty, and if I looked nothing like that, then I must be ugly."[9] On her college football memories, Union reflected, "In my family if you couldn't talk Cornhusker football—that means knowing the black shirt defense, knowing the I-back formation—then you don't get to have an opinion. When I first toured the Nebraska campus and I saw Turner Gill walk, I freaked out. That was like the biggest star-struck moment I've probably ever had in my life. But it's because I grew up in a household that always talked specifically Cornhusker football and Big 8 sports, at the time."[10]
Union has said her personality as a young person was "mean" until her trainer A.J. Johnson confronted her over the behavior during a party the two were attending.[11]
In 1992, at the age of 19, Union was attacked and raped at her part-time job at a Payless shoe store by a robber.[12] Union has stated that she would not have survived the attack had it not been for lessons she learned by watching Oprah Winfrey's talk show.[13] She later successfully sued Payless for negligence, alleging that the store failed to warn employees about the assailant, who had been positively identified robbing another Payless location prior to her rape.[14]
Union has a bachelor's degree in sociology from UCLA.

Union was featured in The Brothers and was seen as having a "beguiling sincerity, even when she's fudging the truth."[17] Union was cast in her first leading role in the 2003 film Deliver Us from Eva with LL Cool J. This was her second time working with the rapper since making a cameo in his video "Paradise" in 2002. When casting Eva, director Gary Hardwick was looking for an actress capable of instantly changing "from funny to caustic and dramatic." Hardwick had previously worked with Union in The Brothers and believed she was perfect for the role of Eva.[18] Union's role in the film was met by praise, with Dustin Putman of All-Reviews.com wrote that she was "the star attraction, and the number-one reason to even consider seeing the film."[19] Union drew influence from her father for the "stern" look she had in the film, admitting that she had stolen it from him.[18]

In an interview with Art Nouveau Magazine, Union complained about the lack of roles for black actresses and actors in Hollywood: "There used to be [roles] specifically written black, if you knew Denzel was doing a movie you knew his wife, girl or love interest was going to be black [but] that's not necessarily the case anymore. You’re in that room with every amazingly talented actress of every hue, and it's a dogfight, it's hard".[32] Moreover, although she often plays weak, insecure characters, Union believes that "Hollywood needs to recognize all shades of African-American beauty."[citation needed]
