Adam Douglas Driver was born on November 19, 1983, in San Diego, California,[5] the son of Nancy Wright (née Needham), a paralegal, and Joe Douglas Driver.[6][7][8] He has Dutch, English, German, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.[9] His father's family is from Arkansas and his mother's family is from Indiana. His stepfather, Rodney G. Wright, is a minister at a Baptist church.[10][11] When Driver was seven years old, he moved with his older sister and mother to his mother's hometown of Mishawaka, Indiana, where he graduated from Mishawaka High School in 2001.[12][13] He was raised Baptist and sang in the choir at church.[14]
Driver has described his teenage self as a "misfit"; he told M Magazine that he climbed radio towers, set objects on fire, and co-founded a fight club with friends, inspired by the 1999 film Fight Club.[15] After high school, he worked as a door-to-door salesman selling Kirby vacuum cleaners and as a telemarketer for a basement waterproofing company and Ben Franklin Construction.[16] He applied to the Juilliard School for drama, but was rejected.[17]
Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Driver enlisted in the United States Marine Corps[18] and was assigned to Weapons Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines as an 81mm mortar man.[19] He served for two years and eight months before dislocating his sternum while mountain biking.[20] He was medically discharged with the rank of Lance Corporal. He then attended the University of Indianapolis for a year before auditioning again for Juilliard, this time succeeding. Driver said that his classmates saw him as an intimidating and volatile figure, and he struggled to fit into a lifestyle so different from the Marines.[15] He was a member of the Drama Division's Group 38 (2005–2009), where he met his future wife, Joanne Tucker. He graduated with a BFA degree in 2009.[21]
After graduating from Juilliard, Driver began his acting career in New York City, appearing in both Broadway and off-Broadway productions. Like many aspiring actors, he occasionally worked as a busboy and waiter.[22] Driver also appeared in several television shows and short films. His first on-screen appearance was in the series finale of The Unusuals in 2009 as a repentant witness and reluctant accomplice to an unsolved assault. He made his feature film debut in Clint Eastwood's biographical drama J. Edgar in 2011.
In 2012, Driver was cast in the HBO comedy-drama series Girls, as the emotionally unstable Adam Sackler, the boyfriend of the lead character Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham).

In 2016, Driver played a supporting role in Jeff Nichols' sci-fi thriller Midnight Special, which was released on March 18, 2016.[34][35] He also co-starred in Martin Scorsese's historical drama Silence (2016) as Father Francisco Garupe, a 17th-century Portuguese Jesuit priest, alongside Andrew Garfield and Liam Neeson.[36][37] In preparation for the role, Driver lost almost 50 pounds.[38] Jim Jarmusch's drama Paterson was Driver's final film of 2016, in which he played the title character, a bus driver who writes poetry.[39] The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival and was released on December 28, 2016.[40][41] Driver's performance was acclaimed[42][43] and he received multiple nominations for Best Actor from critics associations, winning several, including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor.[44] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote "Driver's indelibly moving portrayal is so lived-in and lyrical you hardly recognize it as acting."[45] Paterson was included in many critics' top ten lists of best films of 2016.[46]
In 2017, Driver played a cameo in Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories as Randy, marking his third appearance in one of Baumbach's films.

Driver also starred as the lead character Toby Grisoni in Terry Gilliam's adventure-comedy The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, which also premiered at Cannes.[50]
In early 2019, Driver starred as Daniel Jones in Scott Z. Burns' political drama The Report, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah.

Later the same year, he co-starred with Scarlett Johansson in Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival.[52][53] Reviewing the film in The Hollywood Reporter,  critic Jon Frosch noted that Driver "delivers a brilliantly inhabited and shaded portrait of a man."[54]
Driver is starring in Leos Carax's upcoming music drama Annette, and is in talks to replace Ben Affleck in Ridley Scott's period drama The Last Duel.[55][56][57] Driver is also set to star in Sylvester Stallone's Tough As They Come.[58]

Driver has expressed on many occasions that he does not like to watch or listen to his own performances. During a radio interview with NPR's Fresh Air he chose not to continue with the interview after the host played a clip from Marriage Story. The executive producer of the radio show later claimed that Driver was warned to take off his headphones before the clip played and that the show did something similar with Driver during a 2015 interview. During the same 2015 interview Driver is quoted as saying he hates viewing or listening to his works.[64]
