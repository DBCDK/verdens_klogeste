Rexha released two additional extended plays in 2017, All Your Fault: Pt. 1 and All Your Fault: Pt. 2, which again saw the moderate success of the singles "I Got You" and "The Way I Are (Dance With Somebody)". Rexha has also seen success with several collaborations including "Me, Myself & I" with G-Eazy, "In the Name of Love" with Martin Garrix, and "Meant to Be" with Florida Georgia Line, the latter of which had large success as a country crossover single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. Rexha's debut studio album Expectations (2018) reached number 13 on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States and saw the success of its lead single "I'm a Mess", and brought Rexha two nominations for Best New Artist and Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 61st Grammy Awards.[9][10]
Rexha was born on August 30, 1989 in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., to ethnic Albanian parents.[11] Her father, Flamur Rexha, was born in Debar, North Macedonia when it was part of Yugoslavia. He immigrated to the US at the age of 21, and her mother, Bukurije Rexha, was born in the US to an Albanian family with roots in Gostivar (which, like Debar, is now part of North Macedonia).[12][13] In the Albanian language, bletë means "bee"; and she explained "My parents are Albanian, and people started calling me 'Bebe' for short."[4] She and her family moved to nearby Staten Island when she was six.[11]
Rexha played trumpet and taught herself to play guitar and piano.[14][15] Rexha attended Tottenville High School on Staten Island,[16] where she took part in a variety of musicals.[7][13] She also joined the choir, while still in high school.[15] After joining the choir, she discovered that her voice was a coloratura soprano.[17][18] Rexha lists Coldplay, the Cranberries, Lauryn Hill, Alanis Morissette, and Kanye West as musical influences.[19][20]
As a teenager, Rexha submitted a song to be performed at the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences' annual "Grammy Day" event. Rexha earned the "Best Teen Songwriter" award, beating around 700 other entrants.[11][21][22] As a result, she signed a contract with talent scout Samantha Cox, who encouraged Rexha to enroll in songwriting classes in Manhattan.[14][23]
In 2010, Rexha met Fall Out Boy's bassist Pete Wentz and began working with him at a recording studio in New York City.[15][24] She became a member and a lead vocalist of Wentz's new experimental project called Black Cards. The band played a variety of live shows and released several singles and remixes. However, in January 2012, Wentz announced that Rexha had left the band to pursue other endeavors.[25] Bebe Rexha was awarded the Able Olman Scholarship for her contributions as a songwriter later that year.[26]
In 2013, Rexha signed with Warner Bros. Records as a solo artist.[27] Rexha had begun writing several songs, including Selena Gomez's "Like a Champion" and Nikki Williams's "Glowing".[6] Her most prominent songwriting effort of 2013 was Eminem's and Rihanna's "The Monster", which was released as the fourth single from Eminem's album The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The song went on to top the charts for the US Billboard Hot 100 and the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and won a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.[28] That same year, Rexha also wrote and was featured on Cash Cash's single "Take Me Home".[19][27]

The song did not originally credit Rexha, despite the fact that she sings the chorus and is featured on background vocals. Eventually, in June 2015, she was given a credit for her work.[34][35]
In January 2015, Rexha co-wrote and was featured on G-Eazy's "Me, Myself & I". The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100[36] and at number one on the US Pop Songs chart.[37] The song was originally titled "I Don't Need Anything" and was intended as a song for Rexha herself.
