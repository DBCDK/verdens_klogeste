Jake Joseph Paul (born January 17, 1997)[1] is an American YouTuber, Internet personality, actor, musician and brother of Logan Paul who rose to fame on the now-defunct video application Vine.[5] He first came into prominence for playing the role of Dirk Mann on the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark. He has since become the subject of controversies due to his unruly behavior.
Paul was born on January 17, 1997 in Cleveland,[1][2] and grew up in Westlake, Ohio. He is the son of Pamela Ann Stepnick (née Meredith) and realtor Gregory Allan Paul.[6] Paul began his career in September 2013 posting videos on Vine. By the time Vine was discontinued, Paul had amassed 5.3 million followers and 2 billion views on the app.[7]
In 2015, it was announced that Paul would be starring as Dirk in Disney Channel's new comedy series, Bizaardvark.[8] On July 22, 2017, during the middle of filming the second season of Bizaardvark, the Disney Channel announced that Paul would be leaving the series, saying in a statement "We've mutually agreed that Jake Paul will leave his role on the Disney Channel series 'Bizaardvark'. On behalf of the production company, the cast and crew, we thank Jake for his good work on the TV series for the past 18 months and extend our best wishes to him."[9]
The announcement followed a news report from KTLA[10] about public complaints from Paul's neighbours regarding the noise generated by Paul's pranks, parties, fire hazards and the large crowds of Paul's fans congregating in their neighbourhood.[11][12][13] Paul later confirmed the news on his Twitter page, saying he would now focus more on his personal brand, his YouTube channel, his business ventures, and more adult acting roles.[9] Paul later revealed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he was actually fired from Bizaardvark by Disney who wanted to expedite the process of weaning him off the show due to the KTLA segment.[14]
On January 17, 2017, on Paul's 20th birthday, it was reported he had launched an entertainment collaborative, titled Team 10, with $1 million in financing to create influencer marketing management and creative agency around teen entertainment.[15] Investors include Danhua Capital, Horizons Alpha, Vayner Capital, Sound Ventures & A-Grade Investments, and Adam Zeplain.[16] On May 30, 2017, Paul released a song and music video alongside Team 10, titled "It's Everyday Bro", which accumulated over 70 million views in one month, and became the third most disliked video on the website. The song peaked at number 91 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the chart dated June 24, 2017.[17]
On July 18, 2017, it was reported that Paul's neighbors in the Beverly Grove neighborhood of Los Angeles were meeting with city council members and police officials about filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Paul.[18] This came after Paul made his home address public,[18][19][13] leading crowds of fans to gather outside Paul's residence, and noise complaints by neighbors.[19][10][20][21] On April 24, 2018, it was reported that Paul was being sued by Cobra Acquisitions, the company that owns the house, for $2.5 million.[22]
On January 3, 2018, Paul uploaded a video to his YouTube channel titled "I lost my virginity" which used a thumbnail of himself and his then-girlfriend Erika Costell posing semi-nude on top of each other. The video was age-restricted by YouTube as a result, and critics such as Keemstar criticized the thumbnail as being inappropriate for his younger audience. The thumbnail was later changed with both Paul and Costell fully clothed and not touching each other.[23]
On January 5, 2018, TMZ featured a video in which Paul used the racial epithet "nigga" multiple times while rapping.[24]
On February 24, 2018, it was announced that Paul and his brother would be fighting KSI and his younger brother, Deji, in two white-collar boxing matches.[25] Paul's fight against Deji was the chief undercard bout before their older brothers, KSI and Logan Paul, did battle in the main event. Paul won the fight after 5 rounds as Deji’s corner threw in the towel after a flurry of shots.[26]
In January 2019, Jake Paul, along with fellow YouTuber RiceGum, came under fire for promoting MysteryBrand, a website which offers the chance to open a digital "mystery box" of pre-selected items with a promise to win one in real life at random. Many users have said they have not received prizes they won through the site.[27]
On December 21, 2019, it was announced that Paul would be making his professional boxing debut against fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib (known as Gib) on January 30, 2020 in Miami.[28] The match between Paul and Gib was the co-feature to the match between professional boxers Demetrius Andrade and Luke Keeler. [28] Jake won the fight via technical knockout at 2:18 in the first round.[29]
Paul dated Tana Mongeau from April 2019 to January 2020.[30] The two were engaged and married, although not legally, in July.[31]
