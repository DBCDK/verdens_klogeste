Finn Michael Wolfhard[1][non-primary source needed] (born December 23, 2002)[2] is a Canadian actor and musician. His acting roles include Mike Wheeler in the Netflix series Stranger Things and Richie Tozier in the 2017 film adaptation of Stephen King's It.
As a musician, he was the lead vocalist and guitarist for the rock band Calpurnia, and is currently a member of The Aubreys.
Wolfhard was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to a family of French, German and Jewish descent.[3] His father, Eric Wolfhard, is a researcher on aboriginal land claims.[4] He has an older brother, actor Nick Wolfhard.[5]
Wolfhard got his first acting job from Craigslist.[6] He made his acting and television debut as Zoran in The 100, followed by a role as Jordie Pinsky in Supernatural.[7]
In 2016, Wolfhard began portraying Mike Wheeler in the Netflix series Stranger Things.[8] He auditioned for the role via video after seeing an open casting call.[6] Wolfhard, along with his castmates, won a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.[9] He and co-stars Noah Schnapp, Gaten Matarazzo, and Caleb McLaughlin competed against one another in a 2017 episode of Spike's Lip Sync Battle.[10]
He also currently stars in the Netflix animated series Carmen Sandiego as "Player", the title character's chief accomplice and friend. The series premiered on January 18, 2019.[11]
Wolfhard made his feature film debut playing Richie Tozier in the film adaptation of Stephen King's It, which was released on September 8, 2017.[12][13] The casting of Wolfhard in both Stranger Things and It, both set in the '80s, had been a coincidence.[14] According to Wolfhard, he had been initially cast as Richie when Cary Fukunaga was attached as director and co-writer, but when Fukunaga left the project over creative differences, the role fell through which allowed him to pursue Stranger Things.[15] Once Andy Muschietti became attached to It, Wolfhard had to re-audition for the role of Richie.[16]
On October 20, 2017, Wolfhard parted ways with his former agency, APA, and fired former agent Tyler Grasham following allegations that Grasham had sexually assaulted aspiring young male actors.[17] Wolfhard himself had not been assaulted.[17] On January 9, 2018, Wolfhard signed with talent agency, CAA.[18]
In 2018, Wolfhard played Tyler, an altruistic and thoughtful pizza delivery boy, in the Ken Marino-directed ensemble comedy film, Dog Days.[19]
In 2019, Wolfhard reprised his role as young Richie in flashbacks for the sequel It Chapter Two (2019).[20] He also co-starred in The Goldfinch, the John Crowley-directed adaptation of the Donna Tartt's novel, playing Young Boris Pavlikovsky, a Ukrainian student and troublemaker.[21] Wolfhard had not been the director's first choice. He had wanted to cast an authentic Russian actor for Boris, but Wolfhard's near perfect Russian accent in his audition helped him get the role.[22] Also that year, Wolfhard provided the voice of Pugsley Addams in an animated remake of The Addams Family, which premiered on October 11.[23]
On May 27, 2019, Wolfhard made his modeling debut in Saint Laurent's Fall/Winter '19 campaign.[24]
In January 2020, Wolfhard portrayed Miles in Amblin’s haunted house film The Turning, an adaptation of Henry James’ novella The Turn of the Screw.[25] Also that month, Wolfhard made his Sundance Film Festival debut[26] with the Miami-set omnibus film, Omniboat: A Fast Boat Fantasia,[27] masterminded by filmmaking collective Borscht Corp.,[28] which also features Robert Redford.[29] In July 2020, Wolfhard will star with Carrie Coon in Jason Reitman's Ghostbusters: Afterlife, with Wolfhard playing the son of Coon's single mother,[30] and Mckenna Grace also starring as his younger sister.[31][32] He is also set to lend his voice in the upcoming 2020 animated series by JJ Villard titled Fairy Tales on Adult Swim in an undisclosed role.[33]
Aside from acting, Wolfhard was the lead vocalist and guitarist, as well as songwriter, for Vancouver-based rock band, Calpurnia, until the band officially dissolved in November 2019. [34] They were signed to Royal Mountain Records in the United States and Canada, and Transgressive Records and its imprint, paradYse, for Europe and the United Kingdom. A few weeks later it was announced that Wolfhard's new band, The Aubreys, would debut on the soundtrack of his movie, The Turning. [35]
Wolfhard has been involved in numerous advocacy contributions. He has sold merchandise that delivered all proceeds to children of indigenous communities, and spread awareness and acceptance for autism. [36]
In May 2017, Wolfhard hosted “Strange 80s,” a benefit concert to raise funds for Sweet Relief, an organization which offered assistance to struggling musicians in need of medical care and healthcare, and performed three tracks with his former band Calpurnia at the fundraiser.[37] For his work with Sweet Relief, he was awarded by the 2017 Television Industry Advocacy Awards as an honoree.[38][39]
