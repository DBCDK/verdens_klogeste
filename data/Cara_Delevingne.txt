Cara Jocelyn Delevingne (/ˈkɑːrə ˌdɛləˈviːn/ KAH-rə DEL-ə-VEEN;[6] born 12 August 1992) is an English model, actress and singer.[7] She signed with Storm Management after leaving school in 2009.[8] Delevingne won Model of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 2012 and 2014.[9]
Delevingne started her acting career with a minor role in the 2012 film adaptation of Anna Karenina. Her most notable roles include Margo Roth Spiegelman in the romantic mystery film Paper Towns (2015), the Enchantress in the comic book film Suicide Squad (2016), and Laureline in Luc Besson's Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017).
Cara Jocelyn Delevingne was born on 12 August 1992,[18] in Hammersmith, London, the daughter of Pandora Anne Delevigne (née Stevens) and property developer Charles Hamar Delevingne. She grew up in Belgravia, London.[19][20] She has two older sisters, Chloe and model Poppy Delevingne. She also has a paternal half-brother, Alex Jaffe.[21] Delevingne attended Francis Holland School for Girls in central London until she was 16,[8] then moved to Bedales School in Steep, Hampshire. She has dyspraxia and found school challenging.[22] In June 2015, in an interview with Vogue, Delevingne talked about her battle with depression when she was 15: "I was hit with a massive wave of depression and anxiety and self-hatred, where the feelings were so painful that I would slam my head against a tree to try to knock myself out."[20] At 16, after completing her GCSEs, she moved to Bedales School in Hampshire, to focus on drama and music. After one year, she dropped out and followed the career path of Poppy into modelling.[8]
Delevingne's godfather is Condé Nast executive Nicholas Coleridge,[23][24] and her godmother is actress Joan Collins.[25] Her maternal grandfather was publishing executive and English Heritage chairman Sir Jocelyn Stevens,[19][23] the nephew of magazine publisher Sir Edward George Warris Hulton and the grandson of newspaper proprietor Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet.[26][27] Her paternal great-grandfather was the Canadian-born British politician Hamar Greenwood, 1st Viscount Greenwood,[28][19] and her maternal grandmother Janie Sheffield was lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret.[19][29] Through one of her maternal great-great-grandfathers, Sir Lionel Lawson Faudel-Phillips, 3rd Baronet, Delevingne descends from the Anglo-Jewish Faudel-Phillips baronets; two of her ancestors on that line served as Lord Mayor of London.[30][31][32]
Delevingne had her first modelling job at age ten in an editorial shot by Bruce Weber for Vogue Italia alongside model Lady Eloise Anson.[33] She signed with Storm Management in 2009. She worked in the industry for a year before booking a paying job and went through two seasons of castings before landing her first runway show.[20]
Delevingne was scouted by Burberry's Christopher Bailey in 2012 while working part-time in the office of a fashion website.[34] Bailey cast her in the company's spring/summer 2011 campaign.[8]
Delevingne's first catwalk appearance was at the February 2011 London Fashion Week, walking for the Burberry Prorsum A/W collection.[35] Later that year, she opened and closed the Burberry Prorsum S/S 2012 collection.[36]
She commenced the early 2012 season by walking in the Chanel Haute-Couture spring show at the Grand Palais.[37]
New York Fashion Week was the first of the "big four" fashion weeks, where Delevingne walked in nine shows for fashion houses including Jason Wu, Rag & Bone, Thakoon, Donna Karan, Tory Burch, Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera.[38] During London Fashion Week, she exclusively walked for the Burberry Prorsum Womenswear A/W 2012 show. She walked in six shows during the Milan Fashion Week, and walked for Fendi, Trussardi, Moschino, Blumarine, DSquared2 and Dolce & Gabbana.
Paris Fashion Week was the final week of Fashion Month, in which she walked in seven shows for Nina Ricci, Sonia Rykiel, Cacharel, Stella McCartney, Paul & Joe, Kenzo and Chanel. This was the beginning of what would turn out to be a longlasting professional relationship with Chanel's head designer and creative director, Karl Lagerfeld. In an interview with Elle after the show, Lagerfeld said, "Cara is different. She's full of life, full of pep. I like girls to be wild but at the same time beautifully brought up and very funny."[39]
Over the course of Fashion Month, she had walked in more than 20 shows and gained media recognition. Vogue described her as their 'crush of the season' and The Daily Telegraph picked up very early, while in New York, on her becoming 'THE' girl of the season after walking in the Jason Wu and Rag & Bone shows.[8]
The international Fashion Month began again in September 2012, to showcase spring/summer collections for 2013. During New York Fashion Week, she walked for designers including Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta and Marchesa.
She walked exclusively for Burberry in London.[40] She followed this appearance by walking in shows for Sass & Bide, Issa, Preen, Topshop, Mary Katrantzou, Giles, and Matthew Williamson.
For Milan Fashion Week, she walked for Moschino, Emilio Pucci, Ermanno Scervino, Ports 1961, Anteprima, Iceberg, Gabriele Colangelo, Anthony Vaccarello, and Just Cavalli.
For Paris Fashion Week, she walked for designers such as Cacharel, Louis Vuitton, and Costume National.[41][42]
Over this season she had walked in over 50 shows.[8] Delevingne then went on to appear in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on 7 November 2012. She featured in the 'Pink is US' section and walked during Justin Bieber's performance of 'Beauty And A Beat'. The show aired on 4 December 2012.
She took part in the Chanel pre-fall 2013 show in Scotland with the runway around the courtyard of Linlithgow Palace. The collection, designed by Karl Lagerfeld, was called "Paris-Edimbourg" and inspired by Scottish style using tartan fabrics. The show renewed media interest in the possibility of restoring the roof of the palace.[43][44][45]
Delevingne walked in the Chanel Haute-Couture spring show and followed this up with an appearance in the Valentino Haute Couture show before flying to New York to take part in New York Fashion Week, the first fashion week of the year. Her first appearance in New York was for Jason Wu. She subsequently walked for Rag & Bone, Tommy Hilfiger, Diane von Furstenberg, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Rodarte, Derek Lam, DKNY, Carolina Herrera, Tory Burch, Jeremy Scott, Oscar de la Renta, Michael Kors, Anna Sui and finally Marc Jacobs' rearranged show, due to a delay in transportation of goods for the show due to the February 2013 nor'easter.[8]
During London Fashion Week she walked for Sister by Sibling, Issa, Topshop, Mulberry, Matthew Williamson, Peter Pilotto, Burberry and Giles. After this Delevingne walked in another seven shows at the Milan Fashion Week for Fendi, Ports 1961, DSquared2, Etro, Versace, Iceberg and Pucci.
In Paris, Delevingne walked in eleven shows for Katie Grand's collaboration with Tod's Hogan brand, H&M, Lanvin, Vanessa Bruno, Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Hakaan and Louis Vuitton. Delevingne's association with Katie Grand's collection went further than a catwalk show appearance as Delevingne sung 'I Want Candy' in the mini film called 'Gang', which is the title of the Katie Grand Loves Hogan 2013 collection and the name of the large-format magazine created to celebrate the collaboration.
In between the two international catwalk seasons, Delevingne was featured in Chanel's Cruise show which took place in Singapore. It was the first time Chanel had held this event in Asia and was held at the Loewen Cluster at Dempsey Hill, a British army barracks turned Singapore Armed Forces manpower base.[46]
The international fashion weeks began again in September 2013, to showcase spring/summer collections for 2014. In the first week, New York, she walked in only one show for Marc Jacobs in a show to which Style.com commented that, "...took us on a trip to the 1890s. The set looked like a bombed-out beach, with cigarette butts, Big Gulp cups, a tumbled-over Frozen Treats case, and destroyed fashion magazines strewn in the black sand."[47]
In London, she walked in five shows. She opened for Mulberry and closed for Burberry and Topshop as well as walking Peter Pilotto and Giles. In Milan, Delevingne only walked for Fendi; she walked in just three shows in Paris for Stella McCartney, Chanel and Valentino. She rounded off the year by again appearing in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.
It was noted by many that Delevingne had started to become more selective with the shows she appeared in. This was the beginning of the decrease in volume of catwalk roles, the cause of which at the time was put down to her expanding acting career.[48] However, in a Time essay published in 2016, Delevingne explained the real cause for the decrease of show appearances:
It's taken time, but now I realize that work isn't everything and success comes in many forms. I've opened my mind, and now I embrace new things with a childlike curiosity. I'm spending more time doing the stuff I love. And I've been able to do better work because of it.[1]
In January 2014, Delevingne opened and closed the Chanel Haute Couture Spring 2014 show.[49] In the A/W 2014 collection showcases she went on to close Burberry's show in the London Fashion Week and appear in fellow British designer Giles' collection.[50]
In Milan, she opened Fendi's F/W 2014 collection for Karl Lagerfeld, before modelling for Stella McCartney in Paris. Her absence in New York was noticed due to Delevingne going from walking in 'just about every single show out there' to only walking in the Marc Jacobs show in 2013. News outlets wrote headlines such as, "Will Cara Delevingne Walk in New York Fashion Week?" in the run up to the fashion week.[51]
Delevingne appeared in a Burberry fragrance advertisement alongside British supermodel Kate Moss.[52]
In the second international fashion month, she opened and closed Topshop's 'Unique S/S 15' collection in London, before going to Milan where she also opened the Fendi S/S 15 show. In Paris, she walked in four shows for Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel and Stella McCartney. She finished 2014 with the Metiers d'Art Pre-Fall 2015/2016 collection showcase. The event was held at the Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg, Austria.[53]

One such example is The Metro which commented that, "In her first major film role, she proves she can act with a sweet and playful on-screen presence. She brings a sense of vitality that is desperately missing from the rest of the film."[79]
