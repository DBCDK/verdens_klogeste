The pair separated when Wade was four months old. Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as trying.[4]

Wade committed to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to play under coach Tom Crean. In his freshman year, Wade was sidelined by NCAA Proposition 48, which set academic eligibility requirements for participation in Division I sports.

Listed at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall and weighing 220 pounds (100 kg), Wade was a shooting guard who could play point as he did during his rookie season and with smaller lineups. On offense, he was one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in NBA history. Wade's signature one-two step allowed him to dash past bigger defenders and draw fouls.[126] Wade ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48 minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. Wade was an unselfish player, averaging 5.4 assists for his career.[27] After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the league's premier clutch players.[127]
David Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players, cited Wade's post-up game as one of his strengths.[128] Thorpe said that Wade's best moves from the post were his turnaround jump shot,[128] double pivot,[128] and what Thorpe termed a "freeze fake",[129] a pump fake Wade used to get his opponent to jump, so that he could drive around him.[129] Wade's main weakness was three-point shooting; he averaged 29% for his career.[27]
Wade was best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders.[126] His style drew concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner,[126] as Wade had hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[130] He holds the NBA record for blocks for players listed 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games, over 400 games less than the previous record-holder: Dennis Johnson (1,100).[131]
Wade married his high school girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002. He divorced her in 2010 after an acrimonious court battle.[133] In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two children.[134][135] Wade also raises a nephew, the son of Wade's sister Deanna.[136][137] Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2009.[138][139] According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands.[137] During that time, Wade and longtime friend Aja Metoyer conceived a son.[140][141] Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013,[142] and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami.[143] On November 7, 2018, Wade became a father for the fourth time, when he and Union welcomed their daughter, who was born via surrogate.[144]
Wade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, "He's the greatest in the Universe", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film Flash Gordon.[145][146] The Heat's 2005 NBA playoffs run and Wade's performances while O'Neal was hampered by injury, led to media attention and rapid increase in Wade's popularity. During those playoffs, Wade's jersey became the league's top-selling jersey and remained so for nearly two years.[147] After the Heat's success and Wade's memorable performances during the 2006 NBA playoffs, Wade appeared on several talk shows, including Late Show with David Letterman and Live with Regis and Kelly.[148] He also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel's Austin & Ally as himself, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon.[149]
Wade was featured in magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on People's 50 Most Beautiful People,[150] and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by GQ.[151] In 2007, Esquire named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year.[152][153] Wade's endorsement deals included Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials paired him with Charles Barkley), and Topps.[154] He had his own line of shoes with Converse named "The Wade" and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile.[155][156] During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand.[157] Wade was chosen by Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining Anthony and Chris Paul, who had their own signature shoes. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.[158]
Wade is well known for his philanthropic involvement. In 2003, he founded The Wade's World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations.[159] He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida.[159] In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event.[160][161] On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home.[162] In addition, Wade donated furnishings, clothing and gifts to the family.[162]
After breaking his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan who lost his hands and feet due to a bacterial infection.[163] Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia.[163] Wade is known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid the media spotlight.[163]
In September 2009, Wade donated money from his foundation to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down.[164] He handed library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building. In January 2010, Wade and Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti",[165] which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days after the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the "Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti" had already raised over $800,000.[165] Wade stated, "I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, and we will continue to accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead."[165] Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.[166]
Wade is a Christian and chose the number 3 throughout most of his career because it represents the Holy Trinity.[167][168] He tithes 10% of his salary to a church in Chicago.[7] His mother, Jolinda, strengthened her ties to Christianity in 2001 after years of drug problems. She served as a minister during her final prison sentence in 2002 and 2003. She was ordained as a Baptist minister in January 2007 and formed the non-denominational Temple of Praise Binding and Loosing Ministry in Chicago. In May 2008, Wade purchased a church building for his mother's ministry.[169]
