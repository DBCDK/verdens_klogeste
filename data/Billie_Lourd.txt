Lourd played the role of Lieutenant Connix in the 2015 Star Wars sequel film The Force Awakens.[16][17] On The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2017, she said that she auditioned for the lead role of Rey, which ultimately went to Daisy Ridley.[18] Lourd also appeared in the second installment, Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017),[19] and the third, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019).

In February 2015, Lourd was cast in the Fox horror-comedy series Scream Queens.[22] Lourd's character, a rich and disaffected sorority girl known as Chanel #3, wears earmuffs as an homage to Fisher's iconic "cinnamon buns" hairstyle from the original Star Wars film.[23][24] In December 2015, Lourd spoke about her initial meeting with Scream Queens creator Ryan Murphy:
I thought he wanted me to audition, and so I was just very relaxed and casual about the news. I didn't think he wanted to hire me, I knew that's not how things worked. The next day, they told me, you know that offer you didn't sound too excited about? It's an offer, not an audition. I flipped out. I didn't know how he was doing this! The next week I was in New Orleans.[25]
By December 2015, Lourd had joined the cast of the American biographical crime-drama film Billionaire Boys Club, in the role of Rosanna, love interest of Kyle Biltmore.[26] The film was released on July 17, 2018. Its release was put off due to claims of sexual harassment committed by actor Kevin Spacey, who stars in the film.[27] In 2016, Lourd returned to Scream Queens for its second season.[28] She joined the cast of American Horror Story in the role of Winter Anderson for the series' seventh season.[29][30] She also portrayed Linda Kasabian, a former member of the Manson Family cult.[31] She returned to American Horror Story for its eighth season, Apocalypse, playing Mallory, a powerful witch.[32][33]
In 2019, Lourd played Gigi in Booksmart, a high school comedy film directed by Olivia Wilde.[34] Lourd also returned to American Horror Story for its ninth season, 1984, portraying serial killer-chased punk rocker Montana Duke.[35][36] Murphy stated that her work in 1984 impressed him so much that he decided to write Lourd her own miniseries.[37] She appeared in the first episode of the eleventh and final season of the NBC sitcom Will & Grace as Fiona, the granddaughter of the character that her real-life grandmother, Debbie Reynolds, portrayed during the show's original run.[38]
In late 2019, Lourd appeared in a holiday-themed TV commercial for Old Navy.[39][40]
