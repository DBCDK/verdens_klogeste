Jamie Richard Vardy (né Gill; born 11 January 1987)[4] is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Leicester City.
After being released by Sheffield Wednesday at the age of sixteen, Vardy began his senior career with Stocksbridge Park Steels, breaking into the first team in 2007 and spending three seasons there before joining Northern Premier League club F.C. Halifax Town in 2010. Scoring 25 goals in his debut season, he won the club's "Player's Player of the Year" award, then moved to Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town in August 2011 for an undisclosed fee. He scored 31 league goals in his first season at his new team, winning the team's "Player of the Year" award as they won the division. 
In May 2012, Vardy signed for Leicester City in the Championship for a non-League record transfer fee of £1 million, and helped the team win the Championship in 2014. In the 2015–16 Premier League season, he scored in eleven consecutive Premier League matches, breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy's record, and was voted the Premier League Player of the Season and FWA Footballer of the Year as outsiders Leicester won the title. 
Vardy made his international debut in June 2015 and was selected for UEFA Euro 2016 and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. On 28 August 2018, Vardy stepped aside from the England national team.[5]
Born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire,[6] Vardy started his career with the Stocksbridge Park Steels youth system at 16 years old after being released by Sheffield Wednesday.[7] He made his way through the reserve team and into the first team making his debut under manager Gary Marrow in 2007,[8] earning £30 a week at the club.[9] After impressive displays, a number of Football League teams became interested and in 2009 he spent a week on trial with Crewe Alexandra.[10] A move did not materialise and he later turned down a short-term contract with Rotherham United.[11]
In June 2010, manager Neil Aspin, a long time admirer of Vardy's talents, signed him for F.C. Halifax Town for a fee of £15,000.[12][13] He made his debut on 21 August 2010 in the home match against Buxton, scoring the winning goal in a match that ended 2–1 to his new club.[14] Vardy had a successful first season with "the Shaymen" finishing as the club's top goalscorer with 25 goals from 37 appearances[15] and being voted the Player's Player of the Season. Towards the end of the season he came close to scoring a hat-trick of hat-tricks but failed to find a third goal in Halifax's 3–1 win over Nantwich Town.[16] His goals helped secure the Northern Premier League Premier Division title for the 2010–11 season.[17] Vardy started the 2011–12 season with Halifax and scored three goals in the opening four matches of the season.[18]
After just over a year with Halifax, Vardy signed for Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town for an undisclosed fee.[19] He made his debut the same day in a 0–0 home draw with York City.[20] He scored his first goals for the club in his third appearance, scoring twice in a 3–2 win away to Kettering Town on 3 September. The following week he scored another two goals against Gateshead at Highbury Stadium, including one in added time. He scored twice for a third consecutive match when on in the 3–1 away win against Ebbsfleet United, but did not score again for just over a month until he scored a hat-trick in the away match against Alfreton Town on 18 October.[21] On 20 September, he was given a straight red card in a 5–2 home win over Kidderminster Harriers, a match in which both teams played over an hour with ten men each.[22] Four days after his hat-trick, Vardy scored two more goals in a 4–1 win over Bath City, a result which left Fleetwood two points behind leaders Wrexham.[23]
In the first round of the FA Cup on 12 November, Vardy scored the second goal in a 2–0 win over League One club Wycombe Wanderers.[24] Fifteen days later, his goal in a 1–1 draw at Gateshead meant that he had recorded a goal in each of his last six appearances, totalling ten goals in that period;[25] he won the Conference Premier Player of the Month award for November.[26] On 13 December, Vardy confirmed a 2–0 win in added time as Fleetwood triumphed 2–0 away to Yeovil Town in the Cup second round replay.[27]
On 1 January 2012, Vardy scored twice in a 6–0 win over Southport, and six days later the team lost 5–1 at home to local rivals Blackpool in the third round of the Cup.[28] After the match, Blackpool manager Ian Holloway made a £750,000 offer for him, which Fleetwood rejected, holding on for £1 million and a loan back to the club.[29] He totalled six goals in his first four matches of the calendar year.[25] On 21 February, he recorded a second hat-trick of the campaign, in a 6–2 win over Ebbsfleet United which left Fleetwood two points ahead of Wrexham at the top of the table.[30] Vardy scored both Fleetwood goals in a 2–2 draw against Lincoln City on 13 April;[31] Wrexham's draw against Grimsby Town the next day gave Fleetwood the Conference title and a first-ever promotion to the Football League.[32] Vardy's 31 league goals saw him finish the season as the top scorer in the Conference Premier.[33]
On 17 May 2012, it was announced that Vardy would be signing for Championship club Leicester City ahead of the 2012–13 season, for a reported fee of £1 million, a non-League record, which could potentially be worth up to £1.7 million with add-ons.[34] The next day, he signed on a three-year contract until June 2015.[35] On 14 August, Vardy made his debut for Leicester against Torquay United in the first round of the League Cup, playing the entirety of the match at Plainmoor and heading the final goal in a 4–0 win.[36] Four days later he made his Football League debut at the King Power Stadium, a 2–0 win over Peterborough United in which he set up a goal for Andy King.[37] He scored his first league goal in a 2–1 away defeat to Blackburn Rovers on 25 August. In September, he scored the winner in two 2–1 comeback victories, against Burnley and Middlesbrough.[25] Vardy's first season at the club was marred by his own loss of form, prompting criticism from some City supporters on social media, and he even considered leaving football until manager Nigel Pearson and assistant manager Craig Shakespeare convinced him to continue with the club.[38]
The following season brought a turn around in Vardy's fortunes as he established himself as a prolific scorer in the Leicester attack as the club took a commanding lead at the top of the table.[38] Vardy scored and won a penalty as Leicester beat high flying local rivals Derby County 4–1 on 10 January 2014 and reaffirmed their position at the top of the Championship.[39] Vardy finished the season with 16 league goals as Leicester were promoted to the Premier League at the end of the season as champions,[40] and was named Leicester's Players' Player of the season at the club's awards.[41]
On 19 August 2014, Vardy extended his contract until the summer of 2018.[40] After missing the first two matches of the season through injury, he made his Premier League debut on 31 August 2014, as a second-half substitute in a 1–1 draw at home to Arsenal. On 21 September, Vardy delivered a man of the match performance by scoring his first Premier League goal and setting up the other four as Leicester made a surprise comeback from 3–1 down to a 5–3 victory against Manchester United.[42]
On 11 April 2015, Vardy scored a 90th-minute winning goal in the Foxes' 3–2 victory at West Bromwich Albion.[43] Impressive form throughout the rest of April, including another winning goal, against Burnley on 25 April, saw Vardy nominated for the Premier League Player of the Month award.[44] Vardy and Leicester ended the 2014–15 season in a safe 14th position having picked up 22 points since 4 April, capping things off by opening the scoring in a 5–1 victory against Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the Premier League season on 24 May.[45]
Vardy started the 2015–16 season by scoring the opening goal as Leicester picked up a 4–2 victory at home against Sunderland on 8 August 2015.[46] He scored the equaliser in Leicester's 3–2 comeback victory against Aston Villa on 13 September.[47] With two goals in Leicester's 5–2 defeat to Arsenal on 26 September, Vardy reached seven league goals for the season, eclipsing his goal tally of the previous year.[48]
On 24 October, he scored the only goal of a home win over Crystal Palace, the seventh consecutive Premier League match in which he scored, and his tenth goal of the league season.[49][50] Vardy scored in his eighth league match in a row on 31 October, and became only the third player ever to do so in the Premier League after Ruud van Nistelrooy (twice) and Daniel Sturridge, in a 3–2 win over West Bromwich Albion.[51][52] A week later, he won and scored a penalty to secure a 2–1 win over Watford, putting him on nine consecutive matches with a goal, behind Van Nistelrooy's Premier League record of ten.[53] Vardy also became the first player in the Premiership to score in nine consecutive matches in a single season, as Van Nistelrooy's 10 matches were at the end of the 2002–03 season and the beginning of the 2003–04 season.[54] For his run of good form, Vardy was the Premier League Player of the Month for October 2015, the first Leicester player to be given the accolade since goalkeeper Tim Flowers in September 2000.[55]
On 21 November, Vardy matched Van Nistelrooy's record of consecutive Premier League matches with a goal, opening a 3–0 win over Newcastle United.[56] A week later, against Manchester United, he scored again to claim the record for himself.[57] His run ended on 5 December when he did not score in a 3–0 win at Swansea City. Had he done so, he would have equalled the English top-flight record of 12 consecutive scoring matches set by Jimmy Dunne for Sheffield United in 1931–32; the result nonetheless put Leicester on top of the table.[58] Following his goalscoring exploits, Vardy was again named as the Premier League Player of the Month for November,[59] becoming only the fifth ever player to win the award in consecutive months.[60] He was presented with a certificate from Guinness World Records for his achievement.[61]
By January 2016, Vardy's transfer value had risen from £2.1 million to £18.8 million,[62] with manager Claudio Ranieri describing him as "priceless".[63] On 2 February, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win against Liverpool, the first being a long-distance volley described as "world class" by opposing manager Jürgen Klopp.[64] Four days later, he signed a new contract to keep himself at Leicester until 2019, increasing his weekly salary to £80,000.[65] On 10 April 2016, Vardy scored both goals (his 20th and 21st of the season) in Leicester's 2–0 win at Sunderland, becoming the first Leicester player since Gary Lineker in the 1984–85 season to score 20 goals in the top division of English football. The result also secured qualification to the UEFA Champions League for the first time in Leicester's history.[66] A week later, Vardy scored the first goal of a 2–2 home draw against West Ham United, but was later sent off for diving in the penalty area under pressure from Angelo Ogbonna.[67] He was charged with improper conduct for his reaction to the dismissal and was fined £10,000, as well as being suspended for two matches during a vital point of Leicester's eventually successful title campaign.[68]
With 24 league goals, Vardy was the second highest scorer in the Premier League for the 2015–16 season, alongside Sergio Agüero, only one goal behind Golden Boot winner Harry Kane.[69] Vardy was one of four Leicester players in the PFA Team of the Year;[70] he was later also named the FWA Footballer of the Year,[71] and the 2016 Barclays Premier League Player of the Season.[72]
On 3 June 2016, Arsenal made a bid of £22 million for Vardy, triggering a release clause in his contract. Leicester offered him improved terms, and 20 days later he agreed to a new four-year deal, to be signed on his return from UEFA Euro 2016. Vardy rejected Arsenal's offer due to not being assured that he would be played in his normal position, and because of the differences between the two club's tactics, with Arsène Wenger favouring possession and Leicester playing on the counter-attack.[73]
On 7 August 2016, he scored in a 2–1 defeat to Manchester United in the 2016 FA Community Shield.[74] Twenty days later, Vardy scored his first league goal of the season in Leicester's first win of the campaign, beating Swansea City 2–1.[75]
On 10 December 2016, Vardy ended his ten-match drought within the opening five minutes against Manchester City. He ended up scoring another two for his first professional hat-trick to help Leicester to a 4–2 victory, their first win in five league matches.[76] A week later, he was sent off in the first half of a 2–2 draw at Stoke City for a challenge on Mame Biram Diouf; Leicester appealed unsuccessfully against his three-match suspension.[77]
On 22 February 2017, Vardy scored his first UEFA Champions League goal in a 2–1 away defeat to Sevilla in the first leg of the round of 16.[78]
Vardy commenced his 6th season at the club on 11 August 2017 by netting two goals in the 4–3 away loss to Arsenal in the opening day of 2017–18 Premier League.[79] This was followed by three more goals in September, including one in the 1–1 draw against Huddersfield Town which was one of two points collected by Leicester in four matches this month.[80] On 16 October, Vardy made his 200th appearance for the club by starting in the 1–1 draw against West Bromwich Albion.[81] Two weeks later, he scored the opener of a 2–0 home win against Everton to give "The Foxes" a second consecutive league win after six winless games and also to send them clear of relegation zone.[82] It was also Claude Puel's debut match as Leicester manager.[82]
Later on 19 December 2017, Vardy scored a 97th-minute equaliser with a penalty kick in the EFL Cup quarter-final match against Manchester City to tie the game 1–1; the game subsequently went to penalty shootouts where Vardy along with Riyad Mahrez were the only players to miss their attempts as Leicester lost 3–4.[83] Four days later, he netted his 50th Premier League goal in the 2–2 draw against Manchester United.[84] Vardy continued his fine form by scoring his 10th Premier League goal of the season on 20 January of the following year via a penalty kick in the 2–0 home win versus Watford.[85] The following month, Vardy scored the lone goal of the FA Cup fifth round match against Sheffield United to allow Leicester progression to quarter-finals,[86] only to be eliminated by Chelsea after extra-time, with Vardy scoring his team's only goal.[87]
By netting a brace in the final day of the season, a 5–4 away defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, Vardy reached 20-goal landmark in the Premier League for the second time in his career.[88] Overall, he made 42 appearances in all competitions, scoring 23 times as Leicester finished the Premier League in 9th place.[89] Vardy was the recipient of the BBC Goal of the Season award for a goal against West Bromwich Albion where he struck a first-time ball with his weaker foot that was looped over his shoulder at range by his strike partner Riyad Mahrez.[90]
On 9 August 2018, just before the start of the 2018–19 season, Vardy signed a new four-year deal at Leicester, keeping him at the club until 2022, when he will be 35.[91] Vardy started the season as a substitute, scoring a 92nd minute consolation goal in the 2–1 away defeat to Manchester United on the opening match of the season.[92] He was sent off the following match after a harsh tackle on Wolves defender Matt Doherty.[93] On 9 March 2019, Vardy scored his 100th goal for Leicester, scoring two goals in a 3–1 home win over Fulham.[94] On 28 April 2019, Vardy scored another two goals, this time in a 3–0 home victory against Arsenal, bringing his goal tally in league football for Leicester to 100.[95]
On 25 October 2019, Vardy scored a hat-trick in a 9–0 away win against Southampton.[96]
On 21 May 2015, Vardy was called up to the English national team for the first time ahead of a friendly against the Republic of Ireland and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Slovenia. He made his debut on 7 June in the goalless draw against the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, replacing captain Wayne Rooney for the final 15 minutes.[97] On 30 August, Vardy was again called up to the England squad for the matches against San Marino and Switzerland in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying,[98] being selected in the starting line-up as England ran out 6–0 winners against San Marino in Serravalle six days later.[99] Vardy scored his first international goal on 26 March 2016, equalising with a back heel from Nathaniel Clyne's cross, as a substitute in a 3–2 away win against Germany.[100] He scored again, three days later, the opening goal in a 2–1 defeat to the Netherlands at Wembley.[101]
Vardy made his tournament debut on 16 June, in England's second group match at UEFA Euro 2016, coming off the bench in the second half to score an equalising goal against Wales, helping his team come from behind to win the match 2–1.[102] During the tournament, there were media rumours of a feud between Vardy and fellow striker Rooney, which were denied by manager Roy Hodgson.[103]
He was named in the 23-man England squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[104] He was used sparingly during the tournament, starting only the final group stage match against Belgium as the England side reached the World Cup semi-finals for only the third time in their history.[105]
On 28 August 2018, Vardy stepped aside from the England national team, telling manager Gareth Southgate that he did not want to be considered for selection unless there was an injury crisis.[5]
Ian Wright, who also rose from non-League football to the Premier League and English national team, wrote in October 2015 that Vardy could be England's equivalent to Salvatore Schillaci at UEFA Euro 2016: Schillaci, another late bloomer, began the 1990 FIFA World Cup as a substitute behind more established players, and ended it as the top scorer.[106] Wright, who first learnt of Vardy when his former Burnley teammate Micky Mellon signed him for Fleetwood, rates Vardy as a hard-working player with a good first touch, who creates constant work for defenders, and plays by instinct instead of being moulded by his managers.[106] Although he usually plays in a central role as a striker, he is a versatile player, who is capable of playing in several attacking positions, and has also been used as a winger.[107]
In addition to his goalscoring, Vardy is known for his high work-rate, relentless running, and direct approach, and is also capable of creating chances for his teammates.[108] He is considered an extremely fast and dynamic striker, with good positioning,[109] and an excellent sense of space in the area;[110] he is also known for his ability to play on the last defender's shoulder, time his runs to beat the defensive line, and stretch opponents,[108] which, combined with his pace, makes him a threat on counter-attacks.[107] A composed finisher and an accurate penalty taker, he is also good in the air, and capable of striking the ball powerfully with both feet.[110][111] England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville commented on how Vardy's approach influences teammates: "He sets the tempo and the tone for the rest of the team and gives no other player behind him any excuse for not working hard."[112]
According to Leicester vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, Vardy drank heavily every night during his early days at the club, and would turn up at training still intoxicated. Srivaddhanaprabha discussed with Vardy over what he expected in his life, and Vardy gave up drinking and took training more seriously from then on.[113]
During UEFA Euro 2016, Vardy spoke to the media about his unusual lifestyle choices for a professional sportsperson. He said that he does not exercise in a gym, and that he consumes Red Bull caffeinated beverages and snus smokeless tobacco.[114][115]
Before turning professional, Vardy combined playing non-League football with a job as a technician making medical splints.[116] In 2007, he received a conviction for assault following an incident outside a pub, and had to play with an electronic tag fitted for six months, while his curfew also limited his playing time at Stocksbridge Park Steels.[117]
In August 2015, The Sun on Sunday published a video of Vardy at a casino the previous month, calling a man of East Asian origin a "Jap". He apologised for a "regrettable error of judgement" and was fined by Leicester, who put him on an educational course.[118]
Vardy met Rebekah Nicholson in 2014 while she was working as a nightclub promoter.[119][120] The couple married on 25 May 2016 at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, with David Nugent as the best man.[121] Vardy has four biological children, three with his wife, and one from a previous relationship. He is also a stepfather to two children from his wife's previous relationships.[122]
In November 2015, Vardy launched V9 Academy, an annual week-long camp designed to offer coaching and guidance to 60 non-League players and offer them the opportunity to showcase their talent in front of scouts from league clubs.[123][124] The same month, Stocksbridge Park Steels named their main stand after him.[125] In December 2015, the Leicester-based food manufacturer Walkers brought out a limited edition 'Vardy Salted' crisp flavour, in recognition of Vardy's goalscoring run.[126] Adrian Butchart, English writer of the Goal! series of football-related fiction films, finished a script in 2016 for a film about Vardy.[127] Vardy is an ambassador for Dorothy Goodman School, a special needs school in Hinckley, Leicestershire.[128]
