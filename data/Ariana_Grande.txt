Ariana Grande-Butera (/ˌɑːriˈɑːnə ˈɡrɑːndeɪ/; born June 26, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Born in Boca Raton, Florida, Grande began her career in the 2008 Broadway musical 13 and rose to prominence for her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013), and in its spin-off, Sam & Cat (2013–2014). After she grew interested in pursuing a music career, Grande recorded songs for the soundtrack of Victorious, and signed with Republic Records in 2011 after the label's executives discovered videos of her covering songs that she uploaded onto YouTube. She released her debut album, Yours Truly (2013). A 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B album, it debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and spawned her first US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single, "The Way".
Grande's second studio album, My Everything (2014), continued the pop-R&B sound of its predecessor and incorporated EDM elements. It topped the Billboard 200 and featured four US top-ten singles: "Problem", "Break Free", "Bang Bang", and "Love Me Harder", the most of any artist that year. Grande's third studio album, Dangerous Woman (2016) became her first of three consecutive number-one albums in the UK, and included the top-five single "Side to Side". Grande began experimenting with trap on her next albums, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019), while maintaining her characteristic pop-R&B tones. Both debuted at number one in several countries and were acclaimed by music critics. The former won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and spawned the international top-three single "No Tears Left to Cry", while the latter was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards and broke several streaming records upon release. With the release of the singles "Thank U, Next", "7 Rings" and "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored", Grande became the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously and the first female artist to succeed herself at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Additionally, she is the only artist to have the lead singles from each of their first five studio albums debut within the top ten in the US.
Grande has received various accolades, including one Grammy Award, one Brit Award, two Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, and seven Guinness World Records. All five of Grande's full-length albums have been certified platinum or better by the RIAA. As one of the leading streaming pioneers in the world, she has amassed over 40 billion streams on platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music. She is the most followed female on the former two, while being the most listened to female on the latter two. An influential figure on social media, she is an outspoken feminist and supporter for LGBT rights. In February 2019, she became the most followed woman on Instagram. Forbes ranked her amongst the highest-paid celebrities in 2019, and Time named Grande as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016 and 2019. Billboard recognized her as the "Woman of the Year" in 2018, and declared her the most accomplished female artist to debut in the 2010s.
Ariana Grande-Butera was born on June 26, 1993, in Boca Raton, Florida.[1][2] She is the daughter of Joan Grande, the Brooklyn-born CEO of Hose-McCann Communications, a manufacturer of communications and safety equipment,[3] and Edward Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton.[4][5] Grande is of Italian descent,[6] and she refers to herself as an Italian American of "half Sicilian and half Abruzzese" descent.[7] She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, an entertainer and producer,[8][9] and she has a close relationship with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande.[10] Grande's family moved from New York to Florida when her mother was pregnant with her, and her parents separated when she was around 9 or 10 years old.[5]
As a child, Grande performed with the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater,[11] playing her first role as the title character in Annie. She also performed in the musicals The Wizard of Oz and Beauty and the Beast.[6][12] At the age of 8, she performed at a karaoke lounge on a cruise ship and with various orchestras such as South Florida's Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops and Symphonic Orchestras, and she made her first national television appearance singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the Florida Panthers.[13] She attended Pine Crest School and North Broward Preparatory School.[14]
By age 13, she became serious about pursuing a music career, though she still concentrated on theater.[15] When she first arrived in Los Angeles to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album: "I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'"[5] In 2008, Grande was cast in the supporting role of cheerleader Charlotte in the musical 13 on Broadway,[16] for which she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award.[17] When she joined the musical, Grande left North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled; the school sent materials to her so she could study with tutors.[18] She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club Birdland.[19]
Grande was cast in the Nickelodeon television show Victorious along with 13 co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009.[20] In this sitcom, set in a performing arts high school, Grande played the "adorably dimwitted" Cat Valentine.[6][20] She had to dye her hair red every other week for the role—which severely damaged her hair[21]—because the executive producer, Dan Schneider, did not want all the cast members to be brunettes, and the red hair was also a feature that the network felt would fit the personality of Cat. The show premiered in March 2010 to the second largest audience for a live-action series in Nickelodeon history with 5.7 million viewers.[22][23] The role helped propel Grande to teen idol status, but she was more interested in a music career, stating that acting is "fun, but music has always been first and foremost with me."[24] Her character was compared to "Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in Clueless" (1995) and described as being "very impressionable and easily swayed" but "generally sweet".[25] The second season premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the highest rated episode of Victorious.[26] In 2010, she played the role of Miriam in the musical Cuba Libre, written and produced by songwriter Desmond Child.[27]
After the first season of Victorious wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut album in August 2010.[28] To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro.[29] She made her first musical appearance on the track "Give It Up" on the soundtrack Victorious: Music from the Hit TV Show in August 2011. While filming Victorious, Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and uploaded them to YouTube.[30] A friend of Monte Lipman, CEO of Republic Records, came across one of Grande's videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a recording contract.[5] She released her first single, "Put Your Hearts Up", in December 2011, which was recorded for a teen-oriented pop album that was not issued.[31] She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying that she had no interest in recording music of that genre.[31] The song was later certified gold by the RIAA.[32] Also in 2011, she voiced the fairy Princess Diaspro in 13 episodes of the Nickelodeon version of the Italian animated television series Winx Club, appeared in Greyson Chance's music video for a song called "Unfriend You" from his album Hold On 'til the Night, portraying Chance's ex-girlfriend, and voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film Snowflake, the White Gorilla.[33][34]

Grande's music is generally described as pop and R&B with elements of EDM, hip hop,[190][191][192][193] and trap music,[194][195][196] the latter first appearing prominently on her Christmas & Chill extended play. While maintaining her typical pop-R&B tones, she has increased incorporation of trap into her music as her career has progressed.[197] She has worked with record producer Tommy Brown on several occasions, most notably on "7 Rings", which helped popularize the mixing of trap songs into pop records.[198] Lyrically, Grande’s songs have covered a wide variety of topics, such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.[199]
Grande's debut album, Yours Truly was complimented for recreating the R&B "vibe and feel of the 90s" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface.[200] The follow-up, My Everything, was described as an evolution from her first album with a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres.[201] She followed her pop-R&B sound on her third album, Dangerous Woman, and was praised by the Los Angeles Times for adapting to different styles with the reggae-pop "Side to Side", the dance-pop-influenced "Be Alright", and the fusion of guitar and trap in "Sometimes."[202] Trap music is heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener and Thank U, Next.[197] In Sweetener, she explored elements of hip hop, funk, and house music with themes of love and prosperity.[199] Elias Leight from Rolling Stone stated that Grande "embraces the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop" on the album.[203] Craig Jenkins from Vulture believes that Grande had changed and approached her style to trap and hip hop, filled with R&B undertones on Thank U, Next,[204] with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love.[199]
Grande said she grew up mainly listening to urban pop and 90s music,[191] and has cited Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as her major vocal influences, saying: "I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it."[205][206] She describes Gloria Estefan as the person who inspired her to pursue a career in the music industry, after Estefan complimented a performance she saw Grande give on a cruise ship when she was eight years old.[207] She has also cited Fergie,[205] Destiny's Child, Beyoncé,[208] India.Arie and Brandy as influences or inspirations. She has praised Imogen Heap's "intricate" song structure and cited Judy Garland as being a childhood influence, admiring Garland's ability to tell "a story when she sings".[209] She has expressed admiration for rappers who impact the music industry without a planned release date, telling Billboard, "My dream has always been to be — obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren’t. ... It’s just like, ‘Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do."[194]
Grande has a four octave soprano vocal range,[6][210] and the whistle register.[211] With the release of Yours Truly, critics compared Grande with Mariah Carey because of her wide vocal range, sound and musical material.[212][213] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Billboard wrote that both Carey and Grande have "the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant."[214] Grande responded to the comparisons, "[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine."[208] Steven J. Horowitz of Billboard wrote in 2014, "With her sophomore album, the "Problem" singer no longer resembles [Carey] – and that's okay."[213]
Mark Savage commented in BBC News: "Ariana Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control".[6] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice "can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced."[215] Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in a 2016 Time magazine article:
[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle. That voice – powered by nothing but your remarkable empathy, your ravenous intelligence, your cool discipline and your voracious ambition.[216]
Grande cited Audrey Hepburn as her biggest style influence during her early years, but began to find imitating Hepburn's style "a little boring" as her career progressed.[217][218] She also drew inspirations from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, including Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.[218] Grande's modest look early in her career was described as "age appropriate", compared with other pop stars who grew up in the public eye.[214] Jim Farber of New York Daily News wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention "for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings."[219] That year, she began to wear short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in performances and on red carpets.[220] After years of dyeing her hair red to play Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions.[137][221] Anne T. Donahue of MTV News argued that her iconic ponytail receives more attention than her bold fashion choices.[222]
