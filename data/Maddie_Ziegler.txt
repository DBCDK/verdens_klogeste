It was so fun to do and it was really out of the box and it expanded me a lot, because I'm used to competition dances where you're like, Point your legs! But this time it was like, you just need to let go and feel it."[31]

Her ... jétés and pirouettes juxtapose self-containment with a sort of reckless abandon. But it is her face ... that truly captivates her audience thanks to the tantalizing allure of catharsis through art. [Ziegler's] work ethic, not to mention her evident love for the art, has made her relentlessly relevant. She has something to say with her performances, whether in a music video for Sia or in a solo at nationals. Her technique is lovely, especially for a 12-year-old. She has stretched knees, pointed feet, and arms that float on clouds, her fingers perfectly placed. But still more important is her virtuosity, her connection with the public. She tells a narrative that resonates with the viewer, whether portraying a scorned lover or a werewolf. This maturity is astounding for a preteen – she just gets it. She's meant to perform, meant to communicate with people. She has defied the odds of Generation Z's competitive, egocentric mentality to make her career about the work, not the celebrity.[135]
Ballet choreographer Troy Schumacher told New York magazine in 2016: "She has, fascinatingly, really created her own world of dance. When we talk about great dancers, it's definitely a persona that leaves a lasting impression – it's not necessarily the most technically perfect dancer. She's only 13, but there's a strong sense of personality that comes through in her movement that is somewhat iconic."[21] Billboard's Jason Lipshutz wrote that Ziegler's live participation in Sia's Nostalgic for the Present Tour "transforms a staged affair into a live one, and a great lineup into an indispensable arena experience"[136] and that Ziegler "possesses an astounding control of her physicality. ... [Her] presence adds a mischievous energy, as if replicated movements can't capture the heart behind those wide eyes and deranged smiles."[137] Leslie Ventura of Las Vegas Weekly noted that, on the tour, "Ziegler ... danced furiously alongside the singer, adding dimension and weight to the dramatic vocals."[138] Britt Robson of the Star Tribune added, "The clear-cut star was Ziegler, obviously Sia's alter ego. ... Ziegler was a riveting whirlwind, contorting her appendages and facial expressions with equal aplomb, topped by forward flips".[139] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that Ziegler's frenetic moves and flickering expressions ramp up the songs' emotional stakes.[140] Reviewing Sia's concert in 2017, Richard He of The Guardian called Ziegler "a physical virtuoso to match Sia's vocal acrobatics, embodying the songs' emotional turmoil."[109] David James Young of Junkee felt that Ziegler's performance "cements her status as one of the great dancers of the modern era. ... She leaves everything out there on the stage".[141] Bonnie Malkin of The Guardian wrote that Ziegler's "face and body are extraordinary. ... So expressive, so wild in her movement, so magnetic."[142]
Ziegler was named by Time magazine as one of the "30 most influential teens of 2015"[67] she made the list again in 2016[143] and in 2017.[144] She was also on the Harpers Bazaar 2015 list of "19 Rising Style Icons Aged 19 and Under".[145] Billboard selected Sia and Ziegler's performance of "Elastic Heart" on Saturday Night Live 2015 as one of the 10 Best SNL musical performances since the 1990s, "thanks in part to 12-year-old dance phenom Maddie Ziegler, who ... displayed power, vulnerability, and more than a little weirdness".[146] Ziegler won a 2016 People's Choice Award,[147] a 2016 Teen Choice Award[148] and a 2017 Teen Choice Award.[149] She was nominated for a 2016 Shorty Award[150] and four 2017 Shorty Awards, where she won in one category and received an audience honor in another.[151][152] In 2018 and 2019, The Hollywood Reporter named Ziegler among Hollywood's top thirty stars under age eighteen.[153][154] In 2018, for the third year in a row, Ziegler won the award for Choice Dancer at the Teen Choice Awards.[155]
