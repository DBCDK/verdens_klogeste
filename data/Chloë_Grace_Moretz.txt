Moretz would help Trevor read lines.[13]
Moretz's first acting role in Hollywood was as Violet in two episodes of the CBS series The Guardian, and her first film role was as Molly in Heart of the Beholder. It was not until her second big-screen acting role, in the 2005 remake of The Amityville Horror, that she earned greater recognition, receiving a Young Artist Award nomination.[14] After Amityville, Moretz received several guest-starring roles on TV, as well as a small role in Big Momma's House 2.

She received widespread critical acclaim for her performance. Roger Ebert gave the film only one star,[17] but wrote about Moretz: "Say what you will about her character, but Chloë Grace Moretz has presence and appeal." That same year, she played Abby, a 12-year-old vampire, in Let Me In (2010),[18] the UK/US remake of the Swedish film Let the Right One In.[19] In November 2010, at age 13, Moretz was called "the busiest actress in Hollywood".[20]

Moretz has done voice work for video games. She reprised her role as Hit-Girl for Kick-Ass: The Game, and played young Lady Emily in Dishonored.[29] When asked in October 2012 why she tends to gravitate towards playing darker, troubled characters, Moretz responded that she has such a happy family life, and finds it challenging to play characters who are significantly different.[30] From March 25 through April 27, 2014, Moretz made her Off-Broadway debut in The Library, directed by Steven Soderbergh.[31][32]
Moretz played the protagonist, Mia, in the adaptation of Gayle Forman's If I Stay (2014). The story follows a 17-year-old classical musician as she deals with the aftermath of a catastrophic car accident involving her family and has an out-of-body experience.[33] Critical response to the film was mixed; a 35% positive rating based on 122 reviews and an average rating of 5/10 garnered by Rotten Tomatoes was accompanied by a critics' consensus praising Moretz for giving the performance "her all".[34] Moretz subsequently starred as Cassie Sullivan in The 5th Wave, an adaptation of the best-selling novel by Rick Yancey. The film was released in January 2016.[35] Hannah Minghella of Sony Pictures said Moretz "embodies the heart, strength and determination that make Cassie such a compelling character."[36]

In September 2016, Moretz told The Hollywood Reporter that she had dropped out of all of her future un-produced projects.[42] The only announced film this affected was The Little Mermaid; several other films she was slated to appear in were already in post-production. She explained: "I want to reassess who I am and find myself within my roles again. I’m realizing that I can slow down."[42] She said that the workload that came from being in several films a year "was causing her to lose sight of why she started acting and instead focus on a film’s box office."[42] She said that she would focus on producing, including two television projects.[42] This was reported by some outlets as Moretz taking a hiatus from acting,[43] so in an interview with E! News Moretz clarified that she was not taking time off, "I'm just becoming more picky and particular about what roles I'm choosing. I think as an actor you have a huge opportunity to find yourself through the roles that you choose. I think it's my time, right now in my life, to figure out who I am and what I am and what I want and what this industry means... Why not sit back, slow down, realize I'm 19 and go, 'Hey, let's make stuff that really, really hits hard with who I am and helps me figure out what it means to be a 19-year-old actor who is just doing her thing.'"[44]
In 2017, Moretz co-starred again with Ansel Elgort, in the crime drama November Criminals.[45] That same year, she appeared in the comedy-drama I Love You, Daddy, directed by Louis C.K. which had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it received negative reviews from film critics.[46] The Orchard who acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film and international distributors, cancelled the release of the film, following sexual misconduct allegations against C.K.[47][48] Following the scandal, Moretz stated “I think it should just kind of go away, honestly. I don’t think it’s time for them to have a voice right now,” “Of course, it’s devastating to put time into a project and have it disappear, but at the same time, this movement is so powerful and so progressive that I’m just happy to be in communication with everyone and to see the big change in the face of the industry, which I think is very, very real.”[49]
In 2018, Moretz appeared in the drama film The Miseducation of Cameron Post opposite Sasha Lane and Forrest Goodluck revolving around a teenage girl who is sent to a conversion camp.[50] The film received positive reviews from film critics, praising Moretz's performance.[51] It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize.[52] The film was released on August 3, 2018, by FilmRise.[53] She next appeared in the horror film Suspiria, a remake of the 1977 film of the same name directed by Luca Guadagnino which had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival in September 2018.[54] It received mixed reviews from critics, and performed poorly at the box office.[55][56] She then appeared opposite Isabelle Huppert in Greta a thriller film, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2018.[57][58] It was released on March 1, 2019, by Focus Features.[59]
