During one of David Dhawan's shoots, Kapoor befriended actor Varun Dhawan, to play with him,[12] and they were holding a torch pretending it to be a camera while delivering film lines to each other,[13][14] and they were also dancing to Govinda's film songs.[15]

Kapoor then enrolled in Boston University to major in psychology,[19] but she left in her freshman year to appear in her debut film after she was seen on Facebook by producer Ambika Hinduja, who cast her for a role in Teen Patti.[20] In an interview with the Filmfare magazine, Shakti Kapoor revealed that Kapoor was barely 16 years old when she was offered her first film by Salman Khan, after he saw one of her school play performances,[21] but she rejected the proposal as she was aspiring to become a psychologist.[22][23] Kapoor was trained as a singer since her childhood as her maternal grandfather[24][25] and mother are classical singers.[26][27]
Kapoor made her acting debut in the 2010 drama Teen Patti, alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Ben Kingsley and R. Madhavan. She played the role of a college girl. The film received generally negative reviews, though her performance was better received. Preeti Arora, writing for Rediff.com stated that: "[t]hough a bit raw, she has a lot of potential."[28] Nikhat Kazmi reviewed: "Shraddha Kapoor makes an interesting debut as the edgy youngster who sheds her specs for sleaze, with alacrity."[29] Kapoor was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, but the film failed to do well at the box office.[30][31][32] After her debut, she signed a three-film deal with Yash Raj Films and featured in their 2011 teen comedy Luv Ka The End, with Taaha Shah.[33] Kapoor portrayed the lead role of a teenage student who plots against her boyfriend after he cheats on her.[34] The film underperformed at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics.[35] However, Kapoor's performance received a positive critical reception. Taran Adarsh wrote: "Shraddha is a revelation, catching you unaware with a confident performance. She's electrifying in the sequence when she breaks down after getting to know the true intentions of her lover."[36] For her performance, Kapoor received the Stardust Searchlight Award for Best Actress.[37] Kapoor was subsequently offered the lead female role in Aurangzeb as a part of her deal with Yash Raj Films. However, she signed on to Vishesh Films' Aashiqui 2 instead, thereby cancelling the three-film contract with Yash Raj Films.[33]

The film was a major box office success with a global revenue of ₹1.09 billion (US$15 million).[38][39] Film critic Anupama Chopra called Kapoor a "real triumph" and added that her "porcelain face has a haunting vulnerability."[40] However, Vinayak Chakravorty of India Today wrote that she "looks pretty [though] fails to add [...] spark."[41] Kapoor received several nominations in the Best Actress category, including one at the Filmfare Awards.[42] That year, she also appeared in a guest appearance for the romantic comedy Gori Tere Pyaar Mein, playing the fiancée of Imran Khan's character.[43]

The film was generally perceived to be plagiarised from the Korean film I Saw the Devil, although Suri claimed that it was an original film.[45] In her review, Raedita Tandon of Filmfare called the film a "gritty, engaging thriller", and stated that Kapoor was a revelation in it.[46] The film eventually emerged as a major commercial success with domestic revenues of over ₹1 billion (US$14 million).[47] Her second release that year was Vishal Bhardwaj's critically acclaimed drama Haider, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, set during the Kashmir conflict of 1995.[48] She played the Ophelia-based character, a journalist named Arshia, opposite Shahid Kapoor and Tabu.

Kapoor began 2016 by featuring as star Tiger Shroff's love interest in the action drama Baaghi, about a pair of rebellious lovers set against the backdrop of a martial arts school. The role required her to practice Kalaripayattu (a martial art originating in the south of India).[55] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express considered her character in it to be dated, but thought that she played the romantic and action sequences "well enough".[56] Commercially, the film performed well and collected a total of ₹1.26 billion (US$18 million).[57][58] Kapoor's final release of the year was the rock musical drama Rock On 2, a sequel to 2008's Rock On!!. She was cast alongside Farhan Akhtar, Arjun Rampal and Prachi Desai. She played the role of Jiah Sharma, an introverted singer and keyboard player, who suffers a neglectful relationship with her father.[59] To prepare, she spent time reading books in isolation[60] and undertook vocal training under the singer Samantha Edwards.[61] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu disliked the film and considered Kapoor's performance "self-consciously meek and submissive".[62] Rock On 2 did not recoup its ₹450 million (US$6.3 million) investment.[63]
In 2017, Kapoor starred in Shaad Ali's romantic drama Ok Jaanu, reuniting with Aditya Roy Kapur.[64] A remake of Mani Ratnam's Tamil romantic drama O Kadhal Kanmani, the film was produced by Karan Johar under the banner of Dharma Productions.

In a review of the latter film, Raja Sen of NDTV considered it to be a "preposterously dimwitted romance" and criticised Kapoor as "shrill and insubstantial".[65] Later in 2017, Kapoor appeared in Apoorva Lakhia's Haseena Parkar, a biopic of terrorist Dawood Ibrahim's sister, who ran a crime ring of her own. Kapoor played the titular role, alongside her brother Siddhanth Kapoor, who essayed Ibrahim's character.[66] The film met with negative reviews;[67][68] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost considered Kapoor's performance to be as "bland as the screenplay", adding that "she tries to appear mature and menacing, but the effort shows too much".[69] None of her 2017 releases performed well at the box office.[70]
Kapoor next starred opposite Rajkummar Rao in the comedy horror film Stree (2018).[71] Based on the Nale Ba legend, the film featured her as a mysterious, unnamed woman who falls in love with Rao's character.[72] The critic Saibal Chatterjee took note of the film's feminist subtext and found Kapoor to be "suitably icy as the enigmatic woman".[73] Rajeev Masand opined that she "blends in nicely as the alluring out-of-towner with an air of mystery around her".[74]
With gross earnings of over ₹1.7 billion (US$24 million), Stree emerged as her highest-grossing release to that point.[75][76] In the same year, Kapoor reteamed with Shahid Kapoor in Batti Gul Meter Chalu, a social problem film about electricity issues in rural India. She agreed to the project due to the social message she found in the script.[77] Filming was marred with dispute when the studio KriArj Entertainment failed to remunerate the crew.

Kapoor began the new decade by reuniting with Dhawan in the dance film Street Dancer 3D (2020), which Namrata Joshi termed a "compilation of indistinguishable performances".[90] It did not perform well commercially.[91] She will next reteam with Shroff in the action sequel Baaghi 3 and star opposite Ranbir Kapoor in Luv Ranjan's as-yet untitled project.[92][93]
