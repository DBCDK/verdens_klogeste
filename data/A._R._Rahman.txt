His works are noted for integrating Indian classical music with electronic music, world music and traditional orchestral arrangements. Rahman also introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films.[2] He is nicknamed "Isai Puyal" (the musical storm) and "Mozart of Madras".[3]
Working in India's film industries, international cinema, and theatre, Rahman is one of the world's best-selling music artists,[4][5][6] with an estimated 150 million records sold worldwide.[7][8][9] With an in-house studio (Panchathan Record Inn in Chennai), Rahman's film-scoring career began during the early 1990s with the Tamil film Roja.

In 2010 the Indian government awarded him the Padma Bhushan, the nation's third-highest civilian award.[11] In 2009, Rahman was included on the Time 100 list of the world's most influential people.[12] The UK-based world-music magazine Songlines named him one of "Tomorrow's World Music Icons" in August 2011.[13]
Rahman was born in Madras, India on 6 January 1967.[14][failed verification] His father, R. K. Shekhar, was a film-score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films; Rahman assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard.
After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income.[15] Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi),[16] Rahman, who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family. which led to him to routinely miss classes and fail exams. Therefore, the Principal Mrs YGP summoned Rahman and his mother and told them that Rahman should focus on academics irrespective of family circumstances. Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year,[17] and later joined Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School, where he was admitted on his music talent and formed a band with his high school classmates.[18] However, after discussing with his mother, he later dropped out of school to pursue a career as a full-time musician.[19][20] 
Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo and Raja)[21] and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue.[22] He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the "ideal combination of music and technology".[23]
Rahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj,[24][25] and at age 11 began playing in the orchestra of Malayalam composer (and close friend of his father) M. K. Arjunan.[26] He soon began working with other composers, such as M. S. Viswanathan, Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu and Raj-Koti,[25] accompanied Zakir Hussain, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan and L. Shankar on world tours and obtained a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music.[16]
Studying in Madras, Rahman graduated with a diploma in Western classical music from the school.[27] Rahman was introduced to Qadiri tariqa when his younger sister was seriously ill in 1984. His mother was a practicing Hindu.[28][29][30] At the age of 23, he converted to Islam with other members of his family in 1989, changing his name to Allahrakka Rahman (A. R. Rahman).[16][31][32][33][34]

Rahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television channels. In 1987 Rahman, then still known as Dileep, composed jingles for a line of watches introduced by Allwyn.[35] He also arranged the jingles for some advertisements that went on to become very popular, including the popular jingle for Titan Watches, in which he used the theme from Mozart's Symphony no.25.[36][37][38] In 1992, he was approached by director Mani Ratnam to compose the score and soundtrack for his Tamil film, Roja.[39][40]
Rahman's film career began in 1992 when he started Panchathan Record Inn, a recording and mixing studio in his backyard. It would become the most-advanced recording studio in India,[39] and arguably one of Asia's most sophisticated and high-tech studios.[41] Cinematographer Santosh Sivan signed Rahman for his second film Yoddha, a Malayalam film starring Mohanlal and directed by Sivan's brother Sangeeth Sivan that released in September 1992.

The films' score was critically and commercially successful in its original and dubbed versions, led by the innovative theme "Chinna Chinna Aasai". Rahman followed this with successful scores and songs for Tamil–language films for the Chennai film industry, including Ratnam's politically-charged Bombay, the urban Kadhalan, Thiruda Thiruda and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman (with its popular dance song, "Chikku Bukku Rayile").[42][43][44][45] Rahman collaborated with director Bharathiraaja on Kizhakku Cheemayile and Karuththamma, producing successful Tamil rural folk-inspired film songs; he also composed for K.

It was featured in the 2002 Palestinian film Divine Intervention and the 2005 Nicolas Cage film, Lord of War. Rangeela, directed by Ram Gopal Varma, was Rahman's Bollywood debut.[58] Successful scores and songs for Dil Se.. and the percussive Taal followed.[59][60] Sufi mysticism inspired "Chaiyya Chaiyya" from the former film and "Zikr" from his soundtrack album for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero (which featured elaborate orchestral and choral arrangements).[34]

R. Rahman through the emotional and haunting score of Bombay and the wit and celebration of Lagaan. But the more of AR's music I encountered the more I was to be amazed at the sheer diversity of styles: from swinging brass bands to triumphant anthems; from joyous pop to West-End musicals. Whatever the style, A. R. Rahman's music always possesses a profound sense of humanity and spirit, qualities that inspire me the most.[138]
Rahman introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films.[2]
Renowned lyricist Gulzar shared the contribution of Rahman in the lyrics :
“First you have the prelude and then the music comes, then you have an interlude, followed by a cross-line," Gulzar says about the conventional film tune. "From the start, songs were written this way. Rahman broke the pattern… the horizon… at what stage the song will return to the refrain, one never knows…Like classical and semi-classical musicians, he elaborates the tune. These elaborations build links and keep unfolding."'Mozart from Madras': New documentary celebrates AR Rahman
