Zlatan Ibrahimović (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈslaːtan ɪbraˈhiːmʊvɪtɕ], Bosnian pronunciation: [zlǎtan ibraxǐːmoʋitɕ]; born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club A.C. Milan.[3] Ibrahimović is widely regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation.[4][5][6] He is one of the most decorated active footballers in the world,[note 1] having won 31 trophies in his career.[9] He has scored over 540 career goals, and has scored in each of the last four decades.[10][11]
Ibrahimović began his career at Malmö FF in 1999, and signed for Ajax two years later. At Ajax, Ibrahimović gained a reputation as one of the most promising forwards in Europe, and departed two years later to sign for Juventus. He excelled in Serie A in a strike partnership with David Trezeguet, before joining domestic rivals Inter Milan in 2006, where he won the Capocannoniere (Serie A Top Scorer) in 2008–09 and won three consecutive Serie A titles. In the summer of 2009, he moved to Barcelona in one of the world's most expensive transfers, before returning to Italy the following season, joining Milan. With them, he won another Serie A title in the 2010–11 season, before joining Paris Saint-Germain in July 2012. During his four-season stay in with them, Ibrahimović won a number of trophies including four consecutive Ligue 1 titles, and was the top scorer in Ligue 1 for three seasons. In October 2015, he became PSG's all time leading goalscorer at the time.[12] In 2016, he joined Manchester United on a free transfer and won the FA Community Shield, Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in his first season. Ibrahimović joined American club LA Galaxy in 2018. Two years later, he rejoined Milan.
Ibrahimović is one of ten players to have made 100 or more appearances for the Swedish national team, over a 15-year international career. He is the country's all-time leading goalscorer with 62 goals. He represented Sweden at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 UEFA European Championships. He has been awarded Guldbollen (the Golden Ball), given to the Swedish player of the year, a record 11 times, including 10 consecutive times from 2007 to 2016.[13] Ibrahimović's bicycle kick goal for Sweden against England won the 2013 FIFA Puskás Award.[14]
Ibrahimović was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI in 2013 and the UEFA Team of the Year in 2007, 2009, 2013 and 2014. He finished at a peak of fourth for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2013.[15] FourFourTwo magazine named him the third-greatest player never to win the UEFA Champions League.[16] In December 2014, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter ranked him the second-greatest Swedish sportsperson ever, after tennis player Björn Borg.[17] Off the field, Ibrahimović is known for his brash persona and outspoken comments, in addition to referring to himself in the third person.[18][19]
— From his autobiography, I Am Zlatan.[20]
Ibrahimović was born in Malmö, Sweden, on 3 October 1981.[21] He was born to a Muslim Bosniak father, Šefik Ibrahimović, who emigrated to Sweden in 1977,[22] and a Catholic Croat mother, Jurka Gravić, who also emigrated to Sweden where the couple first met.[23] His father was born in Bijeljina (in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina), and his mother in the village of Prkos in Škabrnja, in the SFR Yugoslavia (modern-day Croatia).[24]
Ibrahimović began playing football at the age of six, after receiving a pair of football boots. He alternated between FBK Balkan, a Malmö club founded by Yugoslav immigrants, Malmö BI and briefly BK Flagg football clubs.[25][26] While in his early teens, he was a regular for his hometown club Malmö FF.[25] At the age of 15, Ibrahimović was close to quitting his football career, in favour of working at the docks in Malmö, but his manager convinced him to continue playing.[27] As a kid growing up, his hero was Brazilian forward Ronaldo.[28] An avid viewer of Italian football, prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta – a player with similar characteristics to himself – was another player he admired.[29]
— Ibrahimović on turning down Arsenal[18]
Ibrahimović signed his first contract with Malmö in 1996, and moved up to the senior side for the 1999 season of Allsvenskan, Sweden's top-flight league. That season, Malmö finished 13th in the league and were relegated to the second division, but returned to the top flight the next season. Arsène Wenger unsuccessfully tried to persuade Ibrahimović to join Arsenal, while Leo Beenhakker (the technical director of Ajax) also expressed interest in the player after watching him in a friendly against Norwegian side Moss FK.[30] On 22 March 2001, a deal between Ajax and Malmö regarding Ibrahimović's transfer to Amsterdam was announced, and in July, Ibrahimović officially joined Ajax for 80 million Swedish kronor (€8.7 million).[31]
Ibrahimović received little playing time under manager Co Adriaanse, but when Adriaanse was sacked on 29 November 2001, new coach Ronald Koeman inserted Ibrahimović into the starting lineup as Ajax won the 2001–02 Eredivisie title. The next season, Ibrahimović scored twice in a 2–1 victory over French champions Lyon in his Champions League debut on 17 September 2002. He scored five Champions League goals overall as Ajax fell to Milan in the quarter-finals.[32][33]
Ibrahimović's profile rose when he scored an individual goal against NAC Breda on 22 August 2004 – a slaloming run past five opposition players which the commentator compared with Diego Maradona and Zinedine Zidane – that was eventually voted the Goal of the Year by Eurosport viewers.[34][35] On 18 August 2004, during an international match against the Netherlands, Ibrahimović injured Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart, who later accused Ibrahimović of hurting him intentionally. This led to Ibrahimović's sudden sale to Juventus on 31 August.[36]
Ibrahimović moved from Ajax to Juventus for €16 million.[37] He was promptly inserted into the starting eleven due in part to top scorer David Trezeguet's injury problems, and scored 16 goals. The club finished top of Serie A, and in the Champions League they reached the quarter-finals before being knocked out by eventual champions Liverpool.[38] Near the end of the season, Juventus reportedly rejected a €70 million bid for him from Real Madrid, which was later revealed to be a publicity stunt initiated by Ibrahimović's agent, Mino Raiola, in order to increase his market value.[35] At the end of his first season in Italy Ibrahimović was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year, and in November 2005, he was awarded the Guldbollen, a prize awarded to the best Swedish footballer of the year.[39][40]
The following season was poor compared to his first season; his role in Juventus' attack changed, as he became less of a goalscorer and moved more to the sidelines, taking much part in the build-up play, especially as a target player, and his assist numbers increased. In the 2005–06 season, Juventus fans often got frustrated with him due to his anonymous presence in certain important games such as the Champions League defeat to Arsenal. Juventus were stripped of their last two Scudetti as part of the verdict from the Calciopoli scandal, and were relegated to Serie B. The new staff tried to persuade Ibrahimović and other top players to stay with Juventus, but the player and his agent were adamant to move on, with Raiola threatening legal action in order to extricate Ibrahimović from his contract.[41]
On 10 August 2006, Ibrahimović completed a €24.8 million move to Inter Milan, signing a four-year-deal,[42] this coming only a few days after 30-year-old midfielder Patrick Vieira had completed his own transfer from Juve to the Nerazzurri.[43] Ibrahimović revealed that he had supported Inter when he was young.[44]
Ibrahimović made his debut for Inter on 26 August 2006 against Roma in the 2006 Supercoppa Italiana, playing the full 90 minutes as Inter won after extra time.[45] He scored in his Serie A debut against Fiorentina on 9 September as Inter commenced the league with a 3–2 win at Stadio Artemio Franchi.[46] Three days later, in his first Champions League appearance for Inter, Ibrahimović was not able to avoid the 1–0 away defeat to Sporting CP as Inter began their European campaign in the wrong way.[47] Later, on 28 October, in his first "Derby della Madonnina" match against cross-town rivals Milan, Ibrahimović scored the third Inter goal of the match and also his third league goal of the season in a 4–3 thriller win.[48] In his first season at the club, Ibrahimović top scored for Inter in Serie A with 15 goals, as the team won the Scudetto with a record 97 points.[49]
Ibrahimović played his 100th Serie A match on 16 September 2007 at the San Siro against Catania, where he appeared as a second-half substitute for Hernán Crespo in an eventual 2–0 win.[50] In 2007, he signed a new contract until June 2013;[51] it was reported that this contract had made him the world's highest paid footballer.[52] On 18 May 2008, Ibrahimović scored both goals in a 2–0 defeat of Parma on the final day of the 2007–08 Serie A season to give Inter a second consecutive Scudetto.[53] Overall, he scored 17 goals in 26 league matches, and was named both Serie A Footballer of the Year and Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year.[53]
Ibrahimović started his third Inter season by winning the Supercoppa Italiana against Roma. After the regular and extra time had finished in a draw, the match went to a penalty shootout where he successfully converted his penalty attempt.[54] He scored his team's only goal in the 2008–09 Serie A opening match against Sampdoria, which finished in a 1–1 draw.[55] On 4 October, during the match against Bologna at home which Inter won 2–1, Ibrahimović scored a sensational goal, stunning Francesco Antonioli with an irresistible backheeled shot from Adriano's left-wing cross. The goal was later voted Goal of the Year in Serie A.[56] On 19 October 2008, Ibrahimović continued with his solid performances by scoring twice in an impressive 4–0 win at Roma, taking his tally up to five league goals.[57] He then scored another double in the Matchday 12 win against Palermo to help Inter take the lead in the Serie A table by one point.[58] In the next fixture, Ibrahimović provided the assist on the only goal in the Derby d'Italia match against Juventus at home, helping Inter to extend their league lead.[59]
Ibrahimović ended the 2008–09 Serie A season as the league's top goalscorer with 25 goals,[60] helping Inter to another league title. He was also named both Footballer of the Year and Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second consecutive season.[61]

After Inter teammate Maxwell completed his transfer to Barcelona, Barça president Joan Laporta confirmed that there was an agreement in principle between Barcelona and Inter for Ibrahimović to join the club in exchange for striker Samuel Eto'o, plus a reported fee of £59 million.[62][63] Ibrahimović left Inter during their United States summer tour in the World Football Challenge on 23 July 2009 for negotiations with Barcelona, with his last match for Inter being against Chelsea.[64] After Inter agreed terms with Eto'o[65] and Barcelona with Ibrahimović,[66] Barcelona announced Ibrahimović would arrive on 26 July 2009 and undergo a medical test on 27 July 2009.[67]
Ibrahimović passed his medical and was presented to a crowd of over 60,000 at Camp Nou.[68] He signed a five-year contract,[69] for €46 million[69] and the exchange of Eto'o (valued at €20 million) and loan of Alexander Hleb (with an option to purchase for a €10 million fee),[69] with a €250 million release clause,[69] making Ibrahimović worth €66 million. The Hleb deal, however, collapsed. Eventually, Ibrahimović cost Barcelona €69.884 million, which included other fees.[70]:173 As per the Inter book, the fee was €69.5 million,[71][72][73] but part of the Inter fee (max 5% according to FIFA regulation) were deducted and distributed by Barcelona to youth and young professional clubs of Ibrahimović: Malmö FF and AFC Ajax as solidarity contribution.[70][73]
Ibrahimović started the 2009–10 season with his competitive debut for Barcelona on 23 August 2009 by assisting a Lionel Messi goal, leading them to the Supercopa de España, beating Athletic Bilbao 5–1 on aggregate. In his next competitive match, Barcelona won the 2009 UEFA Super Cup with a 1–0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk.[74] In his third appearance, he scored his first goal in Barcelona's La Liga season opener against Sporting Gijón in a 3–0 win. Ibrahimović scored in his next four games, thus setting a team record as the only player ever to score in his first five league matches.[75]
On 20 October, he scored his first Champions League goal for Barcelona in a group stage match against Rubin Kazan. Five days later, he scored twice in a 6–1 thrashing of Real Zaragoza, giving him a league-leading seven goals in seven league matches while sending Barcelona to the top of the table.[76] On 7 November, however, he suffered a thigh injury that kept him out for three weeks. He returned to action in week 12 of the season against Real Madrid as a second-half substitute for Thierry Henry, and scored his eighth goal of the campaign.[77] He finished with 11 goals and 4 assists in Barcelona's first 15 league matches. Barcelona capped off 2009 by winning the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes on 19 December 2009.[78]
Ibrahimović scored Barcelona's only goal in the 2009–10 Copa del Rey first leg match of the round of 16 in a 2–1 loss to Sevilla on 5 January 2010. On 20 January, he was selected in the 2009 UEFA Team of the Year.[79] His first goal of 2010 came on 14 February against Atlético Madrid. In his next appearance, Ibrahimović scored against Stuttgart in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League knockout stage fixture. He was sent off on 6 March in a league match against Almería, which Barcelona appealed to no avail, and he was suspended for one game.[80] A calf strain during warmups before the next La Liga match following his return from suspension against Athletic Bilbao ruled Ibrahimović out of the second leg 4–1 victory over Arsenal, in which he scored two goals away from home, the return leg of El Clásico against Madrid (which Barcelona won 2–0),[81] and the next league match against Deportivo de La Coruña. He made his return as a substitute in the 82nd minute in a 0–0 away draw against Espanyol on 17 April.[82]
— Ibrahimović disparages Guardiola on how he was used at Barcelona.[83]
Following Barcelona's semi-final defeat to Inter Milan in the Champions League, Ibrahimović spoke of how he confronted his coach Pep Guardiola in the changing room. "I yelled: 'You haven't got any balls!' and worse than that I added: 'You can go to hell!' I completely lost it, and you might have expected Guardiola to say a few words in response, but he's a spineless coward. He just [...] left, never to mention it again, not a word."[83] He scored his final goal for Barcelona in the 2010 Supercopa de España on 14 August in a 3–1 defeat against Sevilla, and on 25 August, he played his last match for the club against Milan for the Joan Gamper Trophy, after which he claimed to the media that his relationship with Guardiola had started deteriorating and that Guardiola had not spoken to him since February.[84] In his autobiography I Am Zlatan, he states, "'It started well but then Messi started to talk. He wanted to play in the middle, not on the wing, so the system changed from 4–3–3 to 4–5–1. I was sacrificed and no longer had the freedom on the pitch I need to succeed."[83]
On 28 August 2010, A.C. Milan announced via their official website that they had signed Ibrahimović for the 2010–11 season. He was loaned out to Milan for the season, with the club having the option to purchase him outright for €24 million at the end of the season.[85][86] He signed a four-year deal immediately after successfully passing the medical examinations.[87] Upon signing, Ibrahimović said, "This move gives me more adrenaline. I have moved here to win the Champions League with Milan. I want to win the double."[87]
Ibrahimović made his Milan debut in a 2–0 loss to Cesena on 11 September, in which he missed a penalty late in the match,[88] and scored his first goals for the club when Milan defeated Auxerre in their first Champions League match of the season on 15 September. On 14 November, Ibrahimović scored in a 1–0 victory against his former club Inter in the Derby della Madonnina.[89] On 20 November, he scored his seventh goal against Fiorentina in the 45th minute with an over-the-head bicycle kick, passing Alexandre Pato as the team's top goalscorer for the season. On 4 December 2010, in a game against Brescia, he assisted Kevin-Prince Boateng to give Milan an early lead and then scored the third goal by a powerful shot near the edge of the penalty box to give Milan a 3–0 win.[90] On 12 December 2010, history repeated itself in the game against Bologna after he assisted Boateng to give Milan an early lead once again and scoring later that match to make it 3–0, leading him to 13 goals with 8 assists in 21 matches in all competitions. Within days of the match, he was compared to Milan legend Marco van Basten by both the media and Van Basten himself.[4][91][92]
Ibrahimović received a three-match ban after being shown a red card in a 1–1 home draw against Bari in March 2011 for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach.[93] An additional three-match ban was given to Ibrahimović in February 2012 in a 2–1 home defeat against Fiorentina for swearing at an assistant referee. Ibrahimović stated in his defence that he was talking to himself in frustration.[94] He won his first Scudetto with Milan after a draw against Roma. All agreements between Milan and Barcelona were confirmed on 18 June 2011.[95]
Ibrahimović started the new season on 6 August in the 2011 Supercoppa Italiana against city rivals Inter, where he scored the first goal of a 2–1 comeback victory to clinch the first trophy of the season.[96] In the opening league match of the 2011–12 season, Ibrahimović scored Milan's first goal of a 2–2 home draw against Lazio.[97] He scored his first Champions League goal of the season on 28 September in a 2–0 home win against Viktoria Plzeň,[98] which was followed by another one on 19 October against BATE Borisov in another 2–0 home win.[99] He continued with his solid performances as he scored in a 4–1 home win against Parma and a brace in the team's 3–2 away victory over Roma, ending a successful month of October.[100]
November saw him score in consecutive games against BATE, in the Champions League, and Catania, in the league. Later in the month against Barcelona in another Champions League tie, Ibrahimović scored against his old club to equalise the game at 1–1. Barça eventually pulled away however with Xavi scoring the winning goal for the Catalan giants to make it 3–2 at the San Siro. He ended November with a brace against Chievo, the first of those tallies brought his Serie A career total to 100 goals. In December, Ibrahimović scored a goal in each of five Serie A games. As 2012 started, he scored against Atalanta converting a penalty kick. He was the top goalscorer of Serie A, with 14 goals in 16 appearance following a brace against Novara, of which the second goal came on a cheeky backheel. On 5 January 2012 in a match against Napoli, he was shown a red card for slapping Salvatore Aronica in an off-the-ball incident, and was given yet another three-match ban from Serie A games.[101]
On 15 February, in the first leg of the Champions League's round of 16, Ibrahimović set up both of Robinho's goals and also scored by a spot kick, thus helping Milan win 4–0 over Arsenal.[102] On 3 March, during the 4–0 away win against Palermo, Ibrahimović took the lead of the goalscorers table as he scored a first-half hat-trick to take his tally up to 17 goals.[103] He finished the season as Serie A top scorer with 28 goals in 32 matches.[104]
On 17 July 2012, Paris Saint-Germain confirmed that they had reached an agreement to acquire the sporting and economic rights of Ibrahimović from Milan, having already agreed personal terms with the striker, for a transfer fee of €20 million.[105] Valued at €180 million, these combined fees eclipsed those commanded by Nicolas Anelka. His three-year contract would see him receive a net annual salary of €14 million including bonuses (which would be €2 million more than what he was earning per year just before he left Milan), and make him the second best paid footballer in the world behind Samuel Eto'o.[106][107][108]
The following day, Ibrahimović signed the contract[109] and made the following statement during the press conference: "It is a big step in my career and another dream come true. I am very happy because it is a project that I want to be involved in. I want to be part of the history of the club. I am here to win and nothing else."[110] Ibrahimović scored twice in the second half for PSG to help them rally from 2–0 down at half-time to salvage a 2–2 home draw with Lorient in their opening 2012–13 Ligue 1 match.[111] He scored two goals in the first half to help PSG to a 2–1 win over Lille which was PSG's first Ligue 1 win after three successive draws in the first three league matches of the 2012–13 season.[112]
— Jean-Pierre Papin on Ibrahimović[91]
In the opening 2012–13 Champions League Group A match against Dynamo Kyiv on 18 September 2012, Ibrahimović scored his sixth goal in only his fifth appearance for Carlo Ancelotti's side through a penalty. He thus became the first man to score for six clubs in the UEFA Champions League.[113] On 8 October, Ibrahimović became only the third player (after Ronaldinho and Laurent Blanc) to have played in El Clásico in Spain, the Derby della Madonnina in Italy and Le Classique, the derby between Marseille and PSG. He scored both of PSG's goals (the first goal was from a backheel and the second was from a free kick) in the Ligue 1 Classique derby at the Stade Vélodrome on that day, with the match finishing 2–2.[114] On 11 December 2012, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 away win against Valenciennes.[115]
In January 2013, Ibrahimović was handed the number 10 jersey after the departure of Brazilian winger Nenê. In April 2013, Ibrahimović scored in a 2–2 draw against his former club Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. PSG, however, were knocked out on away goals after drawing 1–1 at Camp Nou in the second leg. He ended the season as the assists leader in the 2012–13 Champions League, providing seven assists.[116] On 12 May 2013, Paris Saint-Germain won the Ligue 1 title after a 1–0 away win against Lyon, their third title and first since 1994.[117][118] He ended the year as Ligue 1's top goalscorer with 30 goals, becoming the first player to reach that mark in the French top flight since Jean-Pierre Papin in the 1989–90 season.[119] On 20 May, he was named as Ligue 1's Player of the Year by the Union nationale des footballeurs professionnels (UNFP).[120][121]
Ibrahimović netted his first goal of the season on 31 August 2013, scoring deep into stoppage time as PSG recorded a 2–0 victory over Guingamp.[122] On 24 September, it was announced that Ibrahimović had extended his contract with PSG, which would see him stay at the club until 2016.[123] A week later on 2 October, the Swede scored twice as PSG ran out 3–0 winners over Benfica in a Champions League group match.[124] On 19 October, he scored two goals in PSG's 4–0 win over Bastia, one an audacious volleyed back heel as he reached behind the defender to fire the ball into the net.[125] The goal was later named as Ligue 1's Goal of the Season, as chosen by the public.[125] Four days later, Ibrahimović scored four goals in PSG's 5–0 away win against RSC Anderlecht in the Champions League; he scored the eighth-fastest hat-trick in the competition's history and became the 11th player to score four times or more in a Champions League match.[126]

Ibrahimović scored his first two goals for Paris Saint Germain on 2 August 2014 against Guingamp in the 2014 Trophée des Champions, winning his first silverware of the season.[131] In the first league match of the season, Ibrahimović scored twice but also missed an open net and had a penalty saved as PSG drew 2–2 with Reims.[132] Ibrahimović scored his first league hat-trick of the season in a match against Saint-Étienne on 31 August.[133] In the quarter-finals of the Coupe de la Ligue on 13 January 2015, Ibrahimović scored the only goal to win away at Saint-Étienne. The home team argued that the ball had not crossed the line, and fans threw objects onto the pitch, disrupting play for ten minutes.[134]
On 11 March, Ibrahimović received a straight red card in a Champions League round of 16 match against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, for a foul on Oscar. PSG drew 2–2 after extra time to qualify for the quarter-finals on away goals.[135] Nine days later, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Lorient at the Parc des Princes.[136][137][138] He netted another hat-trick on 8 April as PSG reached the 2015 Coupe de France Final with a 4–1 win over Saint-Étienne, starting with a penalty for his 100th goal for the club.

Ibrahimović ended the 2015–16 Ligue 1 season as its top scorer, the third time that he had done so. The league match was stopped briefly in the tenth minute as fans gave Ibrahimović – whose PSG shirt was number 10 – a standing ovation. He was also cheered just before the final whistle, holding his two sons in his arms. They had run onto the pitch moments earlier, wearing number 10 PSG shirts with either the word "King" or "Legend" written in English on the back. The names were in reference to their father's "I came like a king, left like a legend" post on social media before the match.[156] On 21 May 2016, Ibrahimović scored twice (his 155th and 156th goals in his 180th and final competitive match for the club) in the second half of the 2016 Coupe de France Final, and also set up Edinson Cavani's goal. PSG defeated Marseille 4–2 in that match. He was substituted to a standing ovation in the final minutes of the match. PSG thus won the Ligue 1-Coupe de France-Coupe de la Ligue domestic treble for the second consecutive season, and equalled Marseille's all-time record of ten Coupe de France titles.[157][158] His record as PSG's all-time top scorer was surpassed by his former strike partner Cavani in January 2018.[159]
On 1 July 2016, Ibrahimović signed as a free agent for Manchester United on a one-year contract, which had the option of being extended depending on his performance for the club.[160][161] His salary was reported to be £200,000 per week.[162] He was handed the number 9 jersey ahead of the 2016–17 season.[163] On 7 August, Ibrahimović scored the match-winning goal for Manchester United in the 2016 FA Community Shield, rising above Wes Morgan to head past Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel in a 2–1 victory.[164] This was his record 10th domestic super cup.[165] In his Premier League debut one week later, he scored with a long-range strike in the 3–1 away win at Bournemouth on the opening day.[166] On 20 August, he scored both goals; a header in the first half and a penalty in the second, to beat Southampton 2–0 on his home debut.[167] On 6 November, he scored twice in a 3–1 away win against Swansea City; his first was the 25,000th goal in Premier League history.

Ibrahimović won his first major European title when Manchester United defeated Ajax in the Europa League Final at the Friends Arena in Stockholm, before being named in the UEFA Europa League squad of the season.[177] At the end of the season, it was announced that Manchester United would release Ibrahimović at the end of his contract on 30 June 2017,[178] although they later confirmed that they were in talks with Ibrahimović to re-sign him for the latter half of the 2017–18 Premier League season.[179]

This is not the game; this is absolutely not the game. Even if you are in MLS or Premier League, wherever, it doesn't work like that. We need to be the leading team and play from there, not to catch the goal all the time, so obviously it's not good."[189][190]
He scored a penalty in a 4–0 win against Columbus Crew on 8 July.[191] Ibrahimović scored his 12th league goal to help his side defeat Philadelphia Union with a 3–1 victory on 22 July.[192] He scored his first hat-trick in the MLS the following week in a 4–3 win against Orlando City, with his three goals inside 24-second-half minutes helping Galaxy to overcome a 2–1 deficit.[193] On 15 September, he scored his 500th professional career goal for club and country with another acrobatic strike in a 5–3 away defeat against Toronto FC.[194] Post match, Ibrahimović stated he was "happy for Toronto because they'll be remembered as my 500th victim".[10] Scoring with an acrobatic flick with his back to goal, in August 2019 it was nominated for the 2019 FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year.[195] In his first year, he was named in the MLS All-Star and MLS Best XI, and was awarded the MLS Newcomer of the Year Award and MLS Goal of the Year.

On 27 December 2019, Ibrahimović returned to Milan on a free transfer on a six-month contract until the end of the season, with an option to extend his contract until the end of the 2020–21 season, subject to certain conditions.[3][206] He made his first appearance since his return to the club on 6 January 2020, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 home draw against Sampdoria in Serie A, at the San Siro Stadium.[207] Ibrahimović scored his first goal for Milan since returning on 11 January, in a 2–0 away win against Cagliari.[208] The landmark goal saw him score in each of the last four decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s, 2020s).[11]

Ibrahimović was called up for a Euro 2008 qualifier against Liechtenstein on 6 September 2006, but two days before the match, he violated team curfew by leaving the hotel with teammates Christian Wilhelmsson and Olof Mellberg, visiting a nightclub. Though none of the players consumed any alcohol, they were nonetheless all sent home by manager Lars Lagerbäck as punishment and did not take part in the match. Mellberg and Wilhelmsson did not appeal the coach's decision, but Ibrahimović felt that it was unjust and therefore refused to take part in Sweden's next qualifiers against Iceland and Spain. He also refused to partake in a friendly against Egypt on 7 February 2007, but ended his self-imposed boycott a month later,[225] and returned for Sweden's loss to Northern Ireland on 28 March.

In October 2012, Ibrahimović scored Sweden's first goal as they came from 4–0 down to draw 4–4 in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against Germany in Berlin.[242] It was the first time in its history that the German national team had not won a match after leading by four goals.[243]
On 14 November 2012, he scored all four goals in a 4–2 win over England in the first ever match at the Friends Arena.[244][245] His fourth goal, a 35-yard overhead kick with his back to goal, won him praise from players and pundits, with the BBC describing it as a goal that "combined unfathomable imagination and expert technique".[246] It would win the 2013 FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year.[14]

In November 2017, after Sweden clinched qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia by defeating Italy in the second qualifying round,[258] there was speculation about a possible return of Ibrahimović to the national team.[259][260] Ibrahimović himself expressed his wish to represent Sweden in the World Cup.[261][262][263] However, in April 2018, Sweden manager Janne Andersson stated that Ibrahimović will not be called-up for the World Cup, thus ending any possibility of a return.[264] Later in June, Ibrahimović blamed the Swedish media for his World Cup absence.[265]
— Downplaying the influence of his background, Ibrahimović describes his unique playing style[266]
Ibrahimović has been described by ESPN as being "good in the air, quick, tall, strong and agile, he plays well with his back to goal and boasts some of the best finishing, vision, passing and ball control around."[4][267] A versatile and well-rounded footballer, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimović is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal.[267][268][269] He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilise his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates.[270][271][272]
While naturally right-footed, Ibrahimović is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot,[269][273][274] and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations.[275][276] An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet,[277] his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a "target man";[272][278][279] despite his large stature, Ibrahimović is uncommonly agile for a player of his size,[280] and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the monicker Ibracadabra in the Italian media.[281][282][283] In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimović possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players;[4][269][271] he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills.[267][284]
Due to his prolific goalscoring, consistency, and spectacular strikes,[267][269][286] Ibrahimović is regarded by many in the sport to be one of the best players in the world during his prime and one of the most complete strikers of his generation;[287] he has also drawn praise from managers and teammates for his leadership and longevity, as well as his fitness, professionalism, and dedication in training.[271][288] Regarding his work-ethic, his former Juventus, Fabio Capello commented in 2016: "At the beginning of his first spell at Juventus [...] I noticed that he was weaker than I thought when he had to kick the ball and was not very strong in the air. Ibrahimovic [sic] loved making assists more than scoring goals. I wanted him to become more ruthless in front of goal and improve his finishing. He had the same technical skills as Van Basten and I made him watch some videos of him to improve his finishing. I told him to watch Van Basten's movements inside the area and the way he used to score goals. Ibra got it straight away; I think results are out there to prove it. He is a very humble guy and he worked every day to improve. He’s proud of himself too, he loves being the best."[289]
Although he has been criticised for his work-rate in big matches, in particular in his youth,[4] throughout his career he has scored in some of the biggest matches in football, including the Derby della Madonnina in Italy, El Clásico in Spain, Le Classique in France, and the Manchester Derby and North-West Derby in England, as well as in UEFA Champions League and UEFA Euro Championship games, against some of the strongest opponents in football, also winning titles in several countries;[290][291][292] he is the only player to have scored for six clubs in the Champions League.[293] Known for his extroverted personality, he has been criticized for his arrogance, aggression and rebellious character.[267][268] Ibrahimović has frequently been compared to Dutchman Marco van Basten, due to their similar playing style and proclivity for scoring from powerful shots and volleys;[268] despite this comparison, Ibrahimović has stated that his main influence was his idol, former Brazilian forward Ronaldo, whom he regards as the greatest player of all time.[28]
On 27 November 2019, it was announced that Ibrahimović had bought 23.5 percent of the shares in Hammarby IF, a Swedish top flight club from Stockholm. The seller was Anschutz Entertainment Group, also the owner of his former club LA Galaxy, who reduced their stake in Hammarby by half.[294] In Sweden, all sport teams in the league systems are regulated to be nonprofit organizations, which means that a majority of the voting rights, or 51 percent, is still controlled by the members of the club.[295] Fans of Malmö FF, who were unhappy with Ibrahimović‘a investment into their rival club, have vandalized his statue in Malmö on numerous occasions.[296]
Ibrahimović has been involved in several violent incidents with teammates, some of which have gone viral on the internet. After a 2004 international friendly against the Netherlands, Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart publicly accused Ibrahimović of deliberately injuring him during the game. Ibrahimović responded by threatening to break both of van der Vaart's legs.[297] Ibrahimović also punched Ajax teammate Mido in the dressing room after the latter had thrown a pair of scissors at him.[297]
During his spell at Barcelona, Ibrahimović had a falling-out with coach Pep Guardiola, culminating in a dressing room incident in which Ibrahimović threw a training-kit box across the room and screamed insults at Guardiola. Guardiola eventually refused to speak to Ibrahimović and loaned him out to Milan.[84] Barcelona vice president Carles Vilarrubi further revealed that Ibrahimović had threatened to publicly beat up Guardiola if he was not released to Milan.[298]
In 2010, Ibrahimović was involved in a training-ground fist-fight with Milan teammate Oguchi Onyewu, after Ibrahimović made a two-footed tackle on him, followed by a headbutt. They were separated and the session prematurely abandoned, with Ibrahimović having suffered a broken rib in the fracas. Both players had accused one of insulting the other.[299] In March 2011, Ibrahimović was given a three-match ban for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach during a game.[300] He received another three-match ban in February 2012 for slapping Napoli player Salvatore Aronica.[301] In 2011, Ibrahimović kicked teammate Antonio Cassano in the face while Cassano was speaking to reporters,[302] and kicked Milan teammate Rodney Strasser during a training session.[303]
In November 2012 with PSG, he received a two-match ban for kicking Saint-Étienne goalkeeper Stéphane Ruffier in the chest.[304][305] In December 2012, Ibrahimović was accused by Lyon defender Dejan Lovren and president Jean-Michel Aulas of deliberately stamping on Lovren's head. Lovren suggested the reason Zlatan escaped punishment was due to his “superstar status”.[306] In February 2013, UEFA handed Ibrahimović a two-match ban for stamping on Valencia winger Andrés Guardado.[307] In March 2013, PSG winger Lucas claimed that Ibrahimović regularly insulted teammates, stating, "He always asks for the ball and insults a lot. He is sometimes a bit arrogant and complains."[308] Lucas later claimed, however, that the interview was twisted and badly translated.[309] In May 2013, Ibrahimović was filmed screaming at PSG sporting director Leonardo after the club's title victory.[310]
Lyon coach Hubert Fournier accused Ibrahimović of abusing officials, stating in January 2015 that "all the referees in this league get insulted by this person".[311] Two months later, after a loss by PSG in a Ligue 1 match, Ibrahimović ranted, "In 15 years I've never seen a [good] referee in this shit country ... [they] don't even deserve PSG." He later apologised, but was criticised by French politicians,[312][313] and Ligue 1 imposed a four-match ban.[314]
Ibrahimović has additionally engaged in multiple incidents while with the national team. After Sweden's 1–0 victory over the Faroe Islands in October 2012, Faroes captain Fróði Benjaminsen accused Ibrahimović of foul play and insults, describing him as "arrogant", "childish", "ignorant", and a "dirty player".[315] In December 2015, French sports daily L'Équipe branded Ibrahimović and Cristiano Ronaldo the "most arrogant" footballers in the world.[316] Ibrahimović was additionally caught on camera kicking teammate Christian Wilhelmsson during training.[303][317]
In 2013, he came under fire from the Sweden women's national team for an interview published on Christmas Day by tabloid Expressen, in which he had commented about the disparity of achievements by, and the treatment of, male and female footballers. His former teammate Anders Svensson had been rewarded with a car for becoming Sweden's most-capped player that year, but Therese Sjögran had received no such reward for doing likewise for the women's team, despite owning 41 more caps (187 to 146) than Svensson at the time.[318] Ibrahimović's response to the issue was that Sweden would be "devaluing" Svensson "by comparing him with the ladies' individual achievements. They can get a bike with my autograph on it and then we're good."[318] Coach Pia Sundhage replied that his comments were "sad and unfortunate" and epitomised "failings in the basic values of male football", while Sjögran said, "I understand him when he says that the men's national team brings in more money and exposure. That's true. But this is about respect."[318]
In April 2016, Mino Raiola announced that Ibrahimović would be suing Swedish trainer Ulf Karlsson over doping claims.[319] According to Expressen, Karlsson cited Ibrahimović's "unnatural" and "rapid weight gain" during his stint with Juventus. Raiola said about the allegations, "The claims are just crazy – the facts are not there. All the clubs Zlatan has been at know he doesn't even take aspirin."[319]
In April 2019, Real Salt Lake defender Nedum Onuoha accused Ibrahimovic of foul play and threats to injure him during a game, calling him "arrogant", "disrespectful", and "a complete thug".[320][321][322] In May 2019, Ibrahimović received a two-match ban for violent conduct, after choking NYCFC goalkeeper Sean Johnson.[323][324] In July 2019, Ibrahimović made controversial remarks about the level of play in the MLS, describing himself as "a Ferrari among Fiats" and "by far the best player" in the league.[325][326] More controversy followed suit when--after the Galaxy's loss to crosstown rivals Los Angeles FC during playoffs--Ibrahimovic was seen making obscene gestures towards heckling fans as he left the pitch.[327]
In November 2019, Ibrahimović bought a 23.5% stake in Stockholm-based club Hammarby, which is the rival to the striker's boyhood club, Malmö. In his statement, the player said that he intends on making it the best club. However, his decision to invest in the club infuriated the fans of Malmö who vandalized his bronze statue and set it ablaze. The striker responded to the incident and marked that the decision had nothing to with where he began his career.[328]
Ibrahimović has two siblings and three half-siblings. His longtime partner is Helena Seger, with whom he has two sons: Maximilian (born 22 September 2006) and Vincent (born 6 March 2008). He currently resides outside Los Angeles, although he still has a home in Malmö, where he spends his summers. Ibrahimović received an honorary black belt in taekwondo; he attended classes at the Malmö Taekwondo club Enighet ("Unity") as a child.[329] Ibrahimović is fluent in five languages: Swedish, Bosnian, English, Spanish and Italian.[330][331] He has stated that he was raised as a Catholic.[332][333][334]
The name "Zlatan" was trademarked in May 2003 at the Swedish Patent and Registration Office for "most likely being perceived as Zlatan Ibrahimović", which meant that he received exclusive rights to the name for certain products, including sporting goods, clothing, and shoes.[335] Ibrahimović is under contract with Nike and features in their television advertising where he has appeared alongside other players in the Nike stable including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Wayne Rooney.[336] He wears the Nike Mercurial boot line and has the names and dates of birth of his sons embedded onto the external sides of his boots. In late 2007, Ibrahimović, with the help of Nike, self-funded Zlatan Court in the streets of the city district Rosengård in his hometown Malmö: he provided a playing mat, goalposts, lighting and a modern fence.[337] In 2008, he donated new Nike kits to his youth club, FBK Balkan.[338]
In a February 2011 interview, Ibrahimović stated that the boxer Muhammad Ali is one of his role models, going on to say: "One of my idols in sport and outside the sport also [sic]...he believed in his [principles] and he never gave [them] up."[339] While in Malmö with the national team in September 2012, Ibrahimović was honoured with the inscription of his name on the city's "Walk of Fame of Sports".[340] The Swedish Post Office issued a set of five postage stamps featuring Ibrahimović in March 2014.[341] Ibrahimović features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series, and was the fourth highest rated player in FIFA 15.[342]
On 11 August 2014, Ibrahimović paid US$51,000 to send the Swedish national football team for the intellectually disabled to the INAS World Football Championships in Brazil. After teammates Johan Elmander, Kim Källström, Andreas Isaksson and Per Nilsson donated autographed jerseys to be auctioned off for the cause, Ibrahimović responded, "What the hell are you going to do with a shirt? How much is it to go?".[343][344] In a league match against Caen on 14 February 2015, Ibrahimović took off his shirt after scoring a goal to unveil the removable tattooed names of 50 people suffering from hunger around the world, in a gesture to raise awareness for famine in accordance with the United Nations World Food Programme.[345]
Active on social media, Zlatan has over 35 million Instagram followers, the most for a person from Sweden.[346] Independent Swedish film production company Auto Images released the sports documentary Becoming Zlatan in February 2016 which follows Ibrahimović through his formative years with Malmö FF and Ajax all the way to his breakthrough with Juventus in 2005. The film has been featured at several film festivals including the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Helsinki Documentary Film Festival and the Rouen Nordic Film Festival amongst others.[347] He does not drink alcohol.[348]
On 8 October 2019, a statue of Ibrahimović was unveiled in his hometown, outside Malmö's Stadion. The statue, created by Peter Linde, is 8 feet 9 inches (2.67 m) tall and weighs almost 500 kilograms (1,100 lb).[349]
Ibrahimović was born to a Bosniak Muslim father, Šefik Ibrahimović, and a Croat Catholic mother, Jurka Gravić; his parents were immigrants to Sweden from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and met for the first time in Sweden. Ibrahimović's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: "I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father."[350][351] He has said in a 2012 interview with PSG that: "My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, but none of that has anything to do with football. I received a special education. I'm me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome..."[352] In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was "not a factor" in fans' perception of him: "For me, it didn't change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic... For me it is all about respect. That's how I grew up and the way I learned to be. This is what I am."[353] Nevertheless he later described himself as a "deeply faithful Catholic".[354]
The Malmö-based television presenter Teddy Landén, who was interviewed for the same documentary, noted Ibrahimović's choice of shirt name following his 2001 transfer to Ajax: "You can see that just the fact that when he [emerged] in the professional [football] world [at Ajax], from Sweden, where he was only known [by the name] Zlatan – his first name – he changed so he would have Ibrahimović on his shirt, on his jersey, because he wanted to honour his background. Being from a Muslim background, being from a very very low key, very low status background, he really [wanted] to show all the kids from Rosengård [and] from Malmö in general: 'If I can do it, you can do it.'"[355]
His surname is tattooed in Arabic on the back of his right arm, the names of his sons Vincent and Maximilian on his right arm. He has the common Buddhist "Five Deva Faces Yantra" representing wind, water, fire, creative perception and space, arranged in a way believed to ward off illness and injury, on his lower back. Another Buddhist tattoo, a "Yant Prajao Khao Nirote" is a protective emblem intended to end the suffering of a family, is on his upper right arm. The phrase 'Only God can judge me' is tattooed on his rib cage, said to reflect the player's 'religious and rebellious' nature, taken from 2Pac.
