There, she was convinced to begin studying writing.[3][7] She went on to the University of Akron where she entered and completed the Northeast Ohio Master of Fine Arts program (NEOMFA) in creative writing in 2014.[9][10]
As a dancer at the Kanopy Dance Company, Johnson took on numerous roles and choreographed her own dances.[11][12] She became a principal dancer at the company midway through her tenure. She also served as a dance teacher at the Kanopy School for Contemporary Dance and Choreography.[3]

Johnson writes most often in free verse on topics generally revolving around femininity and the commodification of female bodies.
