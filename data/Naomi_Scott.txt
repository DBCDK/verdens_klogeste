Her first major acting role was a Disney Channel UK series Life Bites. In 2010, she was cast as Mohini "Mo" Banjaree in the 2011 Disney Channel original film Lemonade Mouth, her first role in an American production.[9] That same year she was cast as Maddy Shannon in the science-fiction series Terra Nova, which premiered in September 2011 on Fox.[10] The series was not renewed for a second season.[11] In 2013, Scott appeared in the music video for the song "Hurricane", by her Lemonade Mouth co-star Bridgit Mendler.

In 2019, Scott starred as Princess Jasmine in the live-action adaptation of Disney's Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie.[17][18][19] Her performance was generally well-received by critics. Tom Jorgensen of IGN found her portrayal of Jasmine, "a clear improvement over the 1992 version" and added that the character, "feels more three-dimensional (pun not intended... nor apologized for) and she is given far more interesting ambitions this time around. Scott gives the character a dignity and drive that makes it easier to root for her than poor old Al."[20] Johnny Oleksinski of The New York Post found Scott's version of Jasmine, "lovely" and also had "more agency and less passiveness" than in the original version.[21] The San Francisco Chronicle's critic Mick LaSalle found Scott to be the "real star" of the film and she "thrives and gives everything to her new power anthem" that was written for the film.[22] The Washington Post's Michael O'Sullivan praised Scott's portrayal as someone, "who doesn’t just dream of escaping from under her father’s restrictive rules about whom she can marry," but is also "super-feminist".[23] Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times described Scott's performance as "winning. " He added, "She also gets the chance to shine and absolutely sparkles" in the new song, "Speechless".[24] For her performance, Scott won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Sci-Fi/Fantasy and also received a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.[25][26] Aladdin was also commercially successful, grossing $1 billion at the box office.[27][28]

In June 2014, Scott married footballer Jordan Spence after four years of dating.[31][32][33]
