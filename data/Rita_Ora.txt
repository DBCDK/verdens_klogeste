Rita Sahatçiu Ora (born Rita Sahatçiu; 26 November 1990) is an English singer, songwriter and actress. She rose to prominence in February 2012 when she featured on DJ Fresh's single "Hot Right Now", which reached number one in the UK. Her debut studio album, Ora, released in August 2012, debuted at number one in the United Kingdom. The album contained the UK number-one singles, "R.I.P." and "How We Do (Party)". Ora was the artist with the most number-one singles on the UK Singles Chart in 2012, with three singles reaching the top position.[3]
Ora's second studio album, Phoenix, was released in November 2018. The lead single, "Your Song", reached the UK top ten; and the subsequent singles, "Anywhere" and  "Let You Love Me", reached the top five in the UK; the latter single made Ora the first British female solo artist to have thirteen top ten songs in the United Kingdom.[4]
Ora was born in Pristina, SFR Yugoslavia (present-day Kosovo[a]),[1] to Albanian parents. Her mother, Vera (née Bajraktari), is a psychiatrist, and her father, Besnik Sahatçiu, is a pub owner, having previously studied economics.[5][6][7] Ora has an older sister, Elena, and a younger brother, Don.[8] She was born as Rita Sahatçiu (pronounced [sahatˈtʃiu]; surname derived from the Turkish word, saatçi, which means "watchmaker"), but her parents later added Ora (which means "time" in Albanian) to the family surname so it could be easily pronounced.[9]
Her family left Kosovo for political reasons, because of the persecution of Albanians initiated with the disintegration of Yugoslavia.[10] They relocated to London, England in 1991, when she was a baby.[5] She grew up in Notting Hill, in West London,[11] and attended St Cuthbert with St Matthias Primary School in Earls Court, following which she graduated from a performing arts school, Sylvia Young Theatre School.[12] She began singing at an early age.[13][14][8]
Ora began performing at open mic sessions around London and, occasionally, in her father's pub.[15] In 2008, she auditioned for Eurovision: Your Country Needs You on BBC One to be the British contestant for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 and qualified, but later withdrew from the competition after a few episodes as she "did not feel ready" and thought "that challenge wasn't for her."[16][17] Her manager, Sarah Stennett (who also worked with Ellie Goulding, Jessie J and Conor Maynard), later told HitQuarters that Ora had entered the competition because at the time she felt it was her only chance at finding success.[18] Stennett reassured her that performing in Eurovision would hinder rather than help her chances to make it as a solo artist.[18]
Shortly after, Ora's management got in touch with the American label, Roc Nation, and told them about her. Ora signed a recording deal and a publishing deal with Roc Nation in December 2008, and was one of their first signees.[18][19][20] She made cameo appearances in Jay Z's video for "Young Forever" (2009) and Drake's video, "Over" (2010).[21][22] After being signed, Ora recorded an album and wanted to release it, but her label advised against it and she started to work on other material for her debut album.[15]
Throughout 2011, Ora released covers and videos about working on her debut album on YouTube.[23] The videos caught the attention of DJ Fresh, who at that time was looking for a female vocalist for his song, "Hot Right Now".[24] Ora featured on the single that was released on 12 February 2012, debuting at number one on the UK Singles Chart.[25] During February 2012, Ora was also the opening act at the UK concerts from Drake's Club Paradise Tour.
The first UK single from her debut album, "R.I.P." (featuring Tinie Tempah), was released on 6 May 2012.[26] Produced by Chase & Status, the song debuted at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first solo UK number one.[27] On 12 August 2012, "How We Do (Party)" was released, and it reached number one in the UK and Ireland. It was Ora's second UK number one as a solo artist, and third overall in 2012.[28]
Whilst supporting Coldplay on their Mylo Xyloto Tour, she later announced that her debut album would be titled Ora.[29] The album was released on 27 August 2012 in Europe and Oceania, and debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart.[3] Ora was nominated for Best New Artist, Push Artist and Best UK/Ireland Act at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards.[30] In September 2012, it was announced that Ora will be the opening act on the UK concerts from Usher's Euphoria Tour set to start in January 2013. Eventually, the tour was postponed due to Usher's "professional and personal commitments."[31] From 23 October through to 30 October 2012, Ora embarked on her first headlining tour, Ora Tour, a mini-concert US tour.
"Shine Ya Light", released on 4 November, became Ora's fourth consecutive UK top ten single in 2012, peaking at number ten.[32][33] On 28 November 2012, Ora performed as a special guest at the concert held in Tirana, Albania for the 100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania.[34] Ora embarked on her first UK tour, "Radioactive Tour", in January 2013, to support her debut album.

In 2014, she had two top-five UK singles; the song "I Will Never Let You Down" which debuted at number one, and she featured on Iggy Azalea's "Black Widow" which peaked at number four in the UK, and the latter became Ora's first top ten song on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number three.[41][42][43] On 14 December 2014, Ora performed at the 2014 telecast of Christmas in Washington, filmed at the National Building Museum.[44] On 22 February 2015, at the 87th Academy Awards, she performed the Academy Award-nominated song "Grateful", which appears in the film Beyond the Lights.[45] On 28 June 2015, Ora released the song "Poison", which debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her sixth top five single in the country.[46]
In December 2015, Ora filed a lawsuit against Roc Nation, seeking release from the label and citing that the contract she signed in 2008 is "unenforceable", due to California's "seven-year rule." The complaint stated that she's "only been permitted to release one album despite creating multiple additional records for release" and that her relationship with Roc Nation is "irrevocably damaged."[47][48] Her complaint also pointed out a breach of contract, reporting that Roc Nation breached the recording agreement by improperly taking twenty percent commission of her income.[49] In January 2016, Roc Nation filed a counter-lawsuit against Ora for breaking her recording contract, in New York.[50] They reached a settlement in May 2016.[51]

On 26 May 2017, Ora released her first solo single in almost two years, titled "Your Song", which peaked at number seven in the UK.[55][56] The song served as the lead single from Ora's second studio album, after previous attempts at her second record were lost in her lawsuit against her former label, Roc Nation. The second single, "Anywhere", became her eleventh top ten song in the UK, peaking at number two.[56] In January 2018, Liam Payne and Ora released the song "For You", from the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Freed, in which Ora co-stars.[57]
On 18 September 2018, Ora revealed the title of her second studio album, Phoenix, and its release date, 23 November. On 21 September, she released the album's fourth single, "Let You Love Me".[58] The song reached number four in the UK, marking Ora's 13th top-ten song, thus breaking a 30-year-old record for most top ten songs by a British female solo artist (previously jointly held by Shirley Bassey and Petula Clark).[4] On 29 October, she announced tour dates for the album in Europe, Asia and Oceania from 1 March until 29 May 2019.[59]
