Hamm was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Deborah (Garner) Hamm and Daniel Hamm.[3] His father managed a family trucking company, and his mother was a secretary.[4][5] He is of German, English, and Irish descent; his surname came from German immigrants.[6]
Hamm's parents divorced when he was two years old, and he lived in the St. Louis suburb of Creve Coeur with his mother[5] until her death from colon cancer, when he was 10 years old.[7] Hamm then lived with his father and grandmother in Normandy, Missouri.[8]
His first acting role was as Winnie-the-Pooh in first grade.[9] At 16, he was cast as Judas in the play Godspell,[10] and enjoyed the experience, though he did not take acting seriously. He attended John Burroughs School, a private school in Ladue, where he was a member of the football, baseball, and swim teams.[11] During this time, he dated Sarah Clarke, who became an actress.[12] When Hamm was 20, his father died.
After graduation in 1989 Hamm enrolled in the University of Texas,[13] where he was a member of the Upsilon chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity. There, Hamm was arrested for participating in a violent hazing incident in November 1990. Mark Sanders was beaten with a paddle and a broom by other fraternity members, while Hamm led Sanders around the fraternity house with a hammer claw around Sanders' testicles; Sanders' clothes were also set afire. The incident resulted in the fraternity being shut down on campus. Hamm made a plea deal and completed probation under the terms of a deferred adjudication; the charges were dismissed during August 1995.[14][15][16]
Hamm enrolled at the University of Missouri.[13] At Missouri he answered an advertisement from a theater company seeking players for a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, auditioned, and was cast in the production.[11] Other roles followed, such as Leon Czolgosz in Assassins.[18]
After graduating in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English,[19] Hamm returned to his high school to teach eighth-grade acting.[5][11][20] One of his students was Ellie Kemper, who later became an actress and stars with him in the Netflix original television series, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.[21]
 Not wishing to stay in a "normal career", Hamm relocated to Los Angeles permanently during 1995[23] with an automobile and $150.[12] He moved into a house with four other aspiring actors and began working as a waiter while attending auditions.[11] He acted in theatre, including as Flavius in a production of Shakespeare's Timon of Athens with the Sacred Fools Theater Company.[24]
Looking older than his age, he found it difficult to find work as an actor, despite representation by the William Morris Agency.[25][12][23][22] During 1998, having failed to obtain any acting jobs after three years,[4] he was terminated as a client by William Morris.

Hamm continued working as a waiter[11] and, briefly, as a set designer for a softcore pornography movie.[22] After repeatedly failing to get promising roles, Hamm set his 30th birthday as a deadline to succeed in Hollywood,[10] stating: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}You either suck that up and find another agent, or you go home and say you gave it a shot, but that's the end of that. The last thing I wanted to be out here was one of those actors who's 45 years old, with a tenuous grasp of their own reality, and not really working much. So I gave myself five years. I said, if I can't get it going by the time I'm 30, I'm in the wrong place. And as soon as I said that, it's like I started working right away.[11]
During 2000, Hamm obtained the role of romantic firefighter Burt Ridley on NBC's drama series Providence.[26][27] His one-episode contract grew to 19,[5][9] and enabled him to quit waiting tables.[12][25] Hamm made his feature movie debut with one line in Clint Eastwood's space adventure Space Cowboys (2000);[26][28] more substantial roles followed in the independent comedy movie Kissing Jessica Stein (2001)[29] and the war film We Were Soldiers (2002).[26][30] During filming that movie, he turned 30.[10] His career was bolstered by his playing the recurring role of police inspector Nate Basso on Lifetime's television series The Division, from 2002 to 2004.[26][27] Other minor roles followed on the television series What About Brian, CSI: Miami, Related, Numb3rs, The Unit, and The Sarah Silverman Program.[26][27] Hamm's Mad Men castmate Eric Ladin has said that one of the reasons he admires Hamm is that while he "made it" later than most actors, Hamm never gave up on acting.[31]
Hamm landed his breakthrough role during 2007, when he was cast from more than 80 candidates[22] as the protagonist character Don Draper, in AMC's drama series Mad Men. In the series, set in a fictional 1960s advertising agency, he plays a suave, married advertising executive with an obscure past.[32] He recalled, "I read the script for Mad Men and I loved it. [...] I never thought they'd cast me—- I mean, I thought they'd go with one of the five guys who look like me but are movie stars".[33] He believes that an actor with a "proven track record" would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show.[23] He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part.[11] Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper's backstory.[4][34] Hamm says that he used memories of his father to portray Draper,[35] a well-dressed, influential man of business and society[9] hiding great inner turmoil[4] and experiencing changes in the world beyond his control.
Mad Men debuted on July 19, 2007, with almost 1.4 million viewers.[36] It developed a loyal audience, with Hamm receiving strong reviews. Robert Bianco of USA Today was complimentary of Hamm's performance, describing the actor's interpretation of Draper as a "starmaking performance".[37] The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert termed Hamm a "brilliant lead".[38]
For his work, Hamm won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series – Drama during 2008.[39] Also during 2008, he was nominated for both the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor and the Primetime Emmy Award[40] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[41] During 2009, Hamm was again nominated for the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award in the same category,[39][42] and received another Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[43] During 2010, Hamm received his third Golden Globe Award nomination.[44] Mad Men concluded its seven-season run on May 17, 2015.[45] Hamm received his first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series on September 20, 2015 after receiving 12 Emmy nominations for acting for and producing the series.[46]
Hamm's next film role was for the 2008 science fiction movie The Day the Earth Stood Still, a remake of the 1951 film of the same name.[47] Although the movie received mixed reviews,[48] it was successful financially, earning $230 million worldwide.[49] Hamm hosted Saturday Night Live, season 34, episode 6, on October 25, 2008,[50] and played various roles, including Don Draper in two sketches.[51] He returned as host again on January 30 and October 30, 2010.[52][53] During 2009, Hamm guest-featured in three episodes of the NBC television situation comedy show 30 Rock, as Drew Baird, a doctor who is a neighbor and love interest of Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey).[54] For these performances, he received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[55]
