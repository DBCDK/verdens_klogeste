Anahí Giovanna Puente Portilla was born on May 14, 1983 in Mexico City, Mexico to Spanish father Enrique Puente, and Mexican mother Marichelo Portilla.[13] She has an older sister, television personality Marichelo Puente[14] (born 1978), and an older half-sister, Diana Puente,[15] from her father's previous marriage.
Anahí began her career on a Mexican television program called Chiquilladas When she was two years old. She then starred in numerous films, including Nacidos para Morir and Había Una Vez Una Estrella, with the latter earning her an Ariel Award for Best Child Actress in 1989.[16] She then went on to star in several telenovelas, including Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real, Hora Marcada, Vivo por Elena, La Telaraña and El diario de Daniela.[17]
In 2001, Anahí was cast as the fourteen-year-old Jovanna Luna in Primer Amor, alongside Kuno Becker, Ana Layevska, and Mauricio Islas. The teen-oriented soap opera was one of the highest-rated in its time-slot during its run.
In 2002, she was cast as Jessica in Clase 406 where she worked alongside Alfonso Herrera, Dulce María, and Christian Chávez, who later became her bandmates in RBD.[18]
She starred in Rebelde in 2004, a Mexican remake of the hit Argentine telenovela, Rebelde Way. Before Rebelde, Anahí had coincidentally starred in Ángeles Sin Paraíso with Felipe Colombo, star of the original Rebelde Way. On Rebelde, Anahí portrayed Mia Colucci, a popular girl from a wealthy family. Rebelde was an international hit and had over 440 episodes, airing from 2004 to 2006.[19]
Following the success of Rebelde, in 2007, Televisa released RBD: La familia, which starred the members of RBD. The sitcom was based on the fictional lives of the members of RBD. The characters of the sitcom were not based on the band's characters in Rebelde, but were instead intended to be similar to the actors' real personalities. RBD: La Familia was the first Mexican show shot entirely in HDTV. The show ran from March 14, 2007 to June 13, 2007, lasting 13 episodes.[20]
In February 2011, four years after her last appearance in a TV series, Anahí was chosen to play the lead role in Dos Hogares, a telenovela written and produced by Emilio Larrosa.[21] After prolonged negotiations, Anahí accepted the role. Filming began on April 25, 2011 and ended on January 14, 2012. The TV series premiered on June 27, 2011 and aired its final episode on January 20, 2012.[22][23][24]

The success of Rebelde launched RBD. RBD released nine studio albums, including records in Spanish, Portuguese and English. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide, 17 million digital downloads, and have toured across South America, North America, Central America and Europe.[26]

According to Billboard, Mi Delirio World Tour was the seventh most profitable tour in 2010. She performed in 10 concerts, attended by over 35,000 people.[31]
Following the success of Mi Delirio, on November 23, 2010, Anahí released Mi Delirio – deluxe edition. The album includes all the songs released with the first album, plus four bonus songs: "Alérgico", "Pobre Tu Alma", "Ni Una Palabra" and "Aleph". The first two were released as singles. The album also contains a letter from Brazilian author Paulo Coelho to Anahí, a photo gallery, and a written message from Anahí to her fans.[32] The album contains a song inspired by Coelho's book Aleph, which follows the third single "Alérgico". There are three known versions of the song: the album version with Anahí only; the Portuguese version featuring Brazilian singer Renee Fernandes, included in the Mi Delirio – deluxe edition (Brazilian edition bonus track); and a duet version featuring Noel Schajris, included in the Mi Delirio – deluxe edition (Colombian edition bonus track). (In the US, this version is instead being on a special edition, Alérgico (Fan edition) – EP.)[33]
In 2010, Anahí presented the Kids Choice Awards Mexico and was nominated in three categories, winning for Favorite Artist and Favorite Look. She performed as well, introducing her single, "Alérgico".[34] The album debuted at number 14 in Mexico, spending seven consecutive weeks in the top 100. "Alérgico" became the second most played song in Mexico for 11 weeks, and was number one on iTunes.[35]

They recorded a song, "Libertad", which was released on iTunes on April 12, 2011.[36][37] The song was included on Christian Chávez's album. In May 2011, Anahí and the Latin pop stars Bryan Amadeus and Ale Sergi were invited by MTV Latin America to perform the opening theme for the TV series Popland!. The song, entitled "Click", was released on iTunes on September 13, 2011.[38] On July 5, 2011, Anahí released a new single, "Dividida", which is also the opening theme of the TV series she starred in, Dos Hogares.[39] She also recorded the ending theme with Carlos Ponce, "Rendirme En Tu Amor", which was released on July 24, 2011.

Anahí released a song, "Están Ahí", without any previous promotion, on May 25, 2015. The song's lyrics are a homage to her fans. A month later, she announced the return of her musical career and released a comeback single "Rumba" featuring Puerto Rican rapper Wisin.
On April 25, 2015, Anahí married Manuel Velasco Coello, the Governor of Chiapas, elected in December 2012. She is not the head of National System for Integral Family Development for the State of Chiapas.[43] That position, traditionally held by the spouse of a State Governor and nationally by the First Lady of Mexico, was already given to the mother of the Governor, Leticia Coello.
She was widely criticized on social media for wearing a 120,000 peso dress during the 2015 celebrations of the Cry of Dolores in Chiapas.[44] Many of the criticisms were from Chiapas being the poorest State in the Union.
During the filming of Primer Amor, Anahí battled a serious eating disorder, anorexia.[45] She weighed approximately 75 pounds (34 kg) at her lowest weight. She spent time in five different treatment centers, and visited doctors and psychologists across the country. One day after returning from a family vacation, she began to feel faint, and was rushed to a hospital, where her heart stopped for eight seconds. She has since recovered and become a vocal spokesperson against eating disorders in Mexico. In 2008, with the support of Televisa, Anahí launched a campaign against anorexia and bulimia.[46]
In 2006, the tax administration of Mexico froze four of Anahí's bank accounts as a preventive measure because she was under investigation for tax fraud. In 2008, after taking the issue to court, Anahí was granted her accounts back, two with Banamex and two at Scotiabank.[47]

In 2007, a Barbie doll version of Anahí, Dulce Maria, and Maite Perroni were released, based on their characters in Rebelde. People en Español named her one of their "50 Most Beautiful" in 2010.[48]
On March 11, 2011, doctors discovered that Anahí's brain was being deprived of a large percentage of oxygen due to a deviated septum.  It was determined that this was the main cause of several ailments that had plagued Anahí, including a heart attack. She underwent a successful operation.[49][50]
On March 23, 2011, Anahí became the spokeswoman for Snickers in Latin America.[51] The advertising campaign that was launched sparked controversy, with National Council to Prevent Discrimination and the National Institute of Women deeming the commercial sexist and filing complaints. Anahí defended the campaign, saying that the commercial wasn't intended to offend anyone. Effem Mexico, the company behind Snickers, disagreed with the sexism complaints. However, before the advertisement aired, they conducted a survey among women, asking their opinions on the content. According to Effem, the majority of the women surveyed did not feel the advertisement was discriminatory.[52][53]

On September 18, 2011, National Geographic aired the original production of "Obsession: Bodies That Scream", filmed in Latin America, which featured the testimonies of people who suffer from body dysmorphia and eating disorders. Anahí spoke about the five-year period in which she suffered from anorexia, and her recovery.[54]  On October 12, 2011, Anahí joined the Non-Violence Project's campaign, "Imagine One Billion Faces For Peace", as a Global Ambassador. The campaign's ambassadors include public figures such as Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono, and Ringo Starr. The campaign aims to honor the legacy of the late John Lennon by calling for peace and non-violence worldwide.
During the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Anahí, alongside other Global Ambassadors, performed in an event for The Non-Violence Project presented by Yoko Ono.[55] Maxim named her as one of the Maxim Hot 100 of 2012, calling her a "Mexican beauty" who represents "a true triple threat: she sings, she acts, and writes hilarious tweets".[56]
On July 16, 2013, a nail polish line by Anahí titled "BE by Anahí" was released.[57] The line is a collection of 25 different colors, with names relating to her music like "rebelde", "delirio", "absurda", "click", "hipnótico" and "Sálvame".[58]
In April 2012, Anahí began dating the governor of Chiapas, Manuel Velasco Coello.[59][60][61] They became engaged in October 2014[62] and married on April 25, 2015 in a private religious ceremony held in San Cristóbal de las Casas. On September 11, 2016, she announced on Instagram  that they were expecting their first child together. Their son Manuel was born on January 17, 2017. Ever since then, she has left the artistic world. Her hiatus didn't necessarily last long though. On January 23, 2020, she released a new single "Latidos".
