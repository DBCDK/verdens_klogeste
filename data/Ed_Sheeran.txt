On 26 April 2011, Sheeran appeared on the TV music show Later... with Jools Holland, where he performed his debut single "The A Team".

Taylor Swift contacted Sheeran after hearing his music while touring Australia in March 2012.[62] He later co-wrote and provided vocals for "Everything Has Changed", a single featured on Swift's fourth studio album, Red.

John decided to appear with Sheeran to circumvent this problem.[65] Sheeran was also featured on some tracks from Irish singer Foy Vance's fourth album Joy of Nothing.[66]
From March to September 2013, Sheeran played at arenas and stadiums across North America as the opening act for Swift's The Red Tour.[67][68] According to Sheeran, it was then his biggest tour, and he added a scarlet RED tattoo to commemorate it.[69] In October 2013, Sheeran headlined three sold-out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden.[68][70][71] At the concert, Sheeran debuted new songs, including "Tenerife Sea",[72] a future track on his second studio album.

On 24 March 2014, Sheeran performed at the Teenage Cancer Trust charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London where he unveiled "Take It Back", a track that would appear on the deluxe version of the second album.[75] "Sing", the lead single, was released on 7 April 2014. Sonically, the song is a departure from Sheeran's previous recordings.[76][77] "Sing" was intended to create hype over the album release, but from concern that this might alienate Sheeran's fan base, "One", an acoustic ballad, was released on 16 May 2014;[68][78] "One" also marked the first of several promotional singles released leading to the album release. By early June 2014, "Sing" had earned Sheeran his first number-one single in the UK.[79]
Sheeran's second studio album, x (pronounced "multiply"), was released worldwide on 23 June 2014. In a span of three years, Sheeran wrote more than 120 songs for the album,[80] the earliest of which was composed shortly after + was released.[81] The album features tracks produced by Rick Rubin, Pharrell Williams and Benny Blanco,[80] as well as that of Gosling's.[76] x peaked at number one in both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. To support the album, Sheeran embarked on a world tour starting on 6 August 2014 at Osaka, Japan. On 27 September 2014, Sheeran was one of the headline acts at the Melbourne Cricket Ground prior to the 2014 AFL Grand Final.[82]
Following "Don't", "Thinking Out Loud" was released on 24 September 2014 as the album's third single. Unlike his previous music videos, Sheeran took the lead role in the single's accompaniment, where he performed a ballroom dance.[83] It became his second single to reach number one in the UK,[84] and it also spent eight weeks at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 (with only "Uptown Funk" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars keeping it from top spot).[85] In 2014, combined streams on Sheeran's catalogue in Spotify reached 860 million; Spotify named him the most-streamed artist and x the most-streamed album.[86] In the same year, the album made Sheeran iTunes' best-selling artist in the UK, Ireland and New Zealand.[87][88]
x was nominated for Album of the Year at the 57th Grammy Awards.[89] Sheeran performed alongside John Mayer at the ceremony.[90] On 25 February, Sheeran won British Male Solo Artist and British Album of the Year for x at the 2015 Brit Awards.[91] On 21 May he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year.[92] On 21 June, Sheeran co-hosted the 2015 Much Music Video Awards in Toronto, where he performed the singles, "Thinking Out Loud" and "Photograph"; he also won two awards, Best International Artist and Most Buzzworthy International Artist or Group.[93][94] On 27 June, Sheeran performed as the opening act for The Rolling Stones in their Zip Code Tour date in Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium.[95] On 10–12 July 2015, Sheeran performed sold-out shows at London's Wembley Stadium.

On 13 December 2016, after a year long hiatus and social media break, Sheeran tweeted a picture and changed his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to a light blue, implying the release of a new album – each of Sheeran's previous albums were a single coloured background with a solid mathematical symbol.[108] On 2 January, he posted a 10-second video on Twitter and other social media showing what was the cover design of his forthcoming album entitled ÷ (pronounced "divide") which was released on 3 March 2017.[109] The album debuted at number one in the UK, the US, Germany, Australia, Canada and other major markets.[110][111][112] With first week sales of 672,000 it is the fastest selling album by a male solo artist in the UK, and third fastest in UK chart history behind 25 by Adele and Be Here Now by Oasis.[110] It had the biggest first week sales of 2017 in the US, until it was surpassed by Taylor Swift's Reputation.[111]
On 6 January, Sheeran released two singles, "Shape of You" and "Castle on the Hill"; the theme of the latter single is about Sheeran's upbringing in his home town of Framlingham in Suffolk, with the castle referring to Framlingham Castle.[113] Following the release of these singles, Sheeran co-hosted the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Scott Mills where it was inferred that he would possibly make an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in 2017.[114] It was also during this show that Sheeran used a new Martin guitar that featured the ÷ logo (of his new album) on both the headstock and body of the acoustic guitar.[115] Both singles went on to break the Spotify day one streaming record, with a combined total of over 13 million streams in 24 hours.[116]

In 2018, two Australian musicians filed a copyright infringement complaint against Sheeran, country music singers Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, among others, accusing them of plagiarising one of their songs. Sean Carey, a former guitarist in the band Thirsty Merc, and keyboardist and songwriter Beau Golden said "The Rest Of Our Life", a song by McGraw and Hill and co-written by Sheeran, is substantially similar to their track "When I Found You".[160] Later that year, legal action was brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song "Let's Get It On" with Marvin Gaye. US District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Sheeran's call for a legal case accusing him of copying parts of the song to be dismissed in January 2019. Stanton said that a jury should decide but that he found "substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements".[161]
Sheeran's earliest memories include listening to the records of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Elton John's Greatest Hits.[38] According to Sheeran, the album that introduced him to music was Van Morrison's Irish Heartbeat.[12] During his childhood his father took him to live concerts that would inspire his musical creations. These included seeing Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall, Paul McCartney in Birmingham, and Bob Dylan.[162] On the influence of Clapton, Sheeran states, "He's the reason I started playing guitar".[163] He singled out Clapton's performance at the Party at the Palace in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, "I was eleven when I saw Eric Clapton play at the Queen's Golden Jubilee concert in June 2002. I remember him walking on stage with this rainbow-coloured Stratocaster and playing the first riff of "Layla". I was hooked. Two days later I bought a black Stratocaster copy for £30 that came with an amp. All I did for the next month was try to play that Layla riff."[164]
He has also cited The Beatles, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences.[165][166] According to Sheeran, he had a stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP for helping him get rid of it.[167] He was also inspired by "Cannonball" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran stating, "seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was unbelievably cool. I went straight home and started writing songs. I would not be doing what I'm doing now if he'd been a jerk."[168] He also played the guitar to Westlife's Greatest hits album when he was ten, citing them as one of his influences.[169][170] Sheeran collaborated with his idol Eric Clapton in April 2016, with Sheeran stating to People magazine, "I sang on Eric Clapton's album [I Still Do]. It's one thing having him on mine, but being his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso,' [appearing as a guest on Clapton's "I Will Be There", in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage], and he did something for my record [performing a guitar solo on "Dive" on Sheeran's album ÷] and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso.'"[163]
In March 2015, Sheeran announced he was setting up a record label, Gingerbread Man Records, which is a deal with Warner Music Group.[171] The label was launched in August 2015 alongside its accompanying YouTube channel.[172] Jamie Lawson, the label's first signee, met Sheeran while they were both in London's folk circuit.[173] Lawson released his self-titled debut album on 9 October 2015, which has earned him a number one in the UK Albums Chart.[174] Sheeran signed his second artist, Foy Vance, in November 2015.[175]
Sheeran performed a gig in Bristol, which raised £40,000 for a charity that reaches out to street sex workers. "It's good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else," Sheeran said. "There's a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve." Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.[176]
Sheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[177] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014.[178] In 2016 he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[179] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in Bridget Jones's Baby, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[179]

In June 2019, Sheeran made his debut appearance in an advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup.[194] A lifelong fan of the product – he has it with everything from fish and chips to his morning sausage “butty” to upmarket dinners, carries a bottle on tour, and has a Heinz Ketchup tattoo on his arm  – he put forward an idea he had written for their next TV campaign, and the company responded.[194][195] A representative from Heinz started that “1/3 of @HEINZ Instagram posts include people mentioning or tagging Ed, dating all the way back to 2014.”[196] Poking fun at people who turn their nose up at those who ask for ketchup in fancy restaurants, the advert sees him walking into a ‘super posh’ restaurant while narrating the message he had sent to the company. As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as “Heinz Edchup”.[194]
Released in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film Yesterday, a film about a struggling singer/songwriter, who after a freak bus accident in the middle of a mysterious worldwide blackout, finds himself in a world where nobody else is aware of the Beatles having ever existed.[197]

In a December 2017 interview with The Sunday Times' "Culture" magazine, Sheeran spoke of his admiration for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. "I love Corbyn. I love everything Corbyn is about. And I feel people thought that, because I didn't put myself behind him, I wasn't a Corbyn supporter. He cares about other people. He cares about all classes, races and generations, and that's how I was brought up – we need more people that care about everyone."[211]
Sheeran publicly opposed Brexit (UK leaving the European Union), and supported the "remain" option. Following the June 2016 referendum result where the British public marginally voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included Sting, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz) who signed a letter to the Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof in October 2018, calling for “a 2nd vote”. Stating that Brexit will “impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation”, the letter adds: “We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.”[212]
On 19 October 2015, Sheeran received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for his "outstanding contribution to music".[213] Sheeran commented: "Suffolk is very much where I call home.

As of 2019 he has received four Grammy Awards (including Song of the Year in 2016 for “Thinking Out Loud“), five Brit Awards (including British Male Solo Artist in 2015), and six Billboard Music Awards (including Top Artist in 2018).[91][106][142] In 2015 and 2018 he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[92][216]
