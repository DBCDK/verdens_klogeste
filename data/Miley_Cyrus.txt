Destiny Hope Cyrus was born November 23, 1992, in Franklin, Tennessee,[9] to Leticia (Tish) Jean Finley and country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. Her parents married the next year.[9] Cyrus was born with supraventricular tachycardia, a condition causing an abnormal resting heart rate.[10] Her birth name, Destiny Hope, expressed her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things. Her parents nicknamed her "Smiley", which they later shortened to "Miley", because she often smiled as an infant.[11] In 2008, she changed her name to Miley Ray Cyrus; her middle name honors her grandfather, Democratic politician Ronald Ray Cyrus from Kentucky.[12]Cyrus's godmother is entertainer Dolly Parton.[13]
Against the advice of her father's record company,[14] Cyrus's parents secretly married on December 28, 1993, a year after her birth.[15] They had two more children together, son Braison and daughter Noah.[16] From previous relationships, her mother has two other children, Brandi and Trace.[17] Her father's first child, Christopher Cody, was born in April 1992.[15] He grew up with his mother, Kristin Luckey, in South Carolina.[14]
All of Cyrus's maternal siblings are established entertainers. Trace is a vocalist and guitarist for the electronic pop band Metro Station.[18] Noah is an actress and, along with Braison, models, singers, and songwriters.[19][20][21][22][23] Brandi was formerly a musician for the indie rock band Frank + Derol[24][25] and is a professional DJ. The Cyrus farmhouse is on 500 acres of land outside Nashville, Tennessee.[26]
Cyrus attended Heritage Elementary School in Williamson County, when her family lived in Thompson's Station, Tennessee.[27] When she was hired for Hannah Montana, the family moved to Los Angeles, where she attended Options for Youth Charter Schools[28] and studied with a private tutor on set.[29] Raised a Christian, she was baptized in a Southern Baptist church before moving to Hollywood in 2005.[30] She attended church regularly while growing up and wore a purity ring.[31] In 2001, when Cyrus was eight, she and her family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada while her father filmed the television series Doc.[32] After Billy Ray took her to see a 2001 Mirvish production of Mamma Mia! at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Cyrus grabbed his arm and told him, "This is what I want to do, daddy. I want to be an actress."[33] She began singing and acting lessons at the Armstrong Acting Studio in Toronto.[34]
Cyrus's debut acting role was portraying a girl named Kylie in her father's television series Doc.[11] In 2003, Cyrus received credit under her birth name for her role as "Young Ruthie" in Tim Burton's Big Fish.[35] During this period, she auditioned with Taylor Lautner for the feature film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. Although she was one of two finalists for the role, she chose Hannah Montana instead.[36]
Her mother Tish Cyrus became Miley's manager, and worked to acquire a team to build her career.[37] Cyrus signed with Mitchell Gossett, director of the youth division at Cunningham Escott Slevin Doherty.[38] Gossett is often credited with "discovering" Cyrus, and played a key role in her auditioning for Hannah Montana.[39] She later signed with Jason Morey of Morey Management Group to handle her music career, having been directed to him by Dolly Parton.[37] She hired her father's finance manager as part of her team.[37]
Cyrus auditioned for the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana when she was eleven years old.[40] She auditioned for the role of the title character's best friend, but was called to audition for the lead role instead.[40] Despite being denied the part at first because she was too "young and small" for the role,[41] she was selected later as the lead because of her singing and acting abilities.[42] The series premiered in March 2006 to the largest audience for a Disney Channel program,[43] and quickly ranked among the highest-rated series on basic cable.[44] The success of the series led to Cyrus being labeled a "teen idol".[35][45] She toured with The Cheetah Girls as Hannah Montana in September 2006, performing songs from the show's first season.[46] Walt Disney Records released a soundtrack credited to Cyrus' character in October of that year.[47] The record was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 chart in the United States; it went on to sell over three million copies worldwide.[48] With the release of the soundtrack, Cyrus became the first act within The Walt Disney Company to have deals in television, film, consumer products, and music.[45]
Cyrus signed a four-album recording contract with Hollywood Records to distribute her non-Hannah Montana soundtrack music.[49] She released the two-disc album Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus in June 2007.[50] The first disc was credited as the second soundtrack by "Hannah Montana", while the second disc served as Cyrus' debut studio album.[50] The album became her second to reach the top of the Billboard 200, and has sold over three million copies since its release.[51] Months after the release of the project, "See You Again" (2007) was released as the lead single from the album.[52] The song was a commercial success, and has sold over two million copies in the United States since its release.[53] She then collaborated with her father on the single "Ready, Set, Don't Go" (2007).[54] Cyrus embarked on her highly successful Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007–08) to promote its release.[55][56] Ticketmaster officials commented that "there [hadn't] been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis".[57] The tour's success led to the theatrical release of the 3D concert film Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008).[58] While initially intended to be a limited release, the film's success led to a longer run.[59]
Cyrus and friend Mandy Jiroux began posting videos on the popular website YouTube in February 2008, referring to the clips as "The Miley and Mandy Show"; the videos garnered a large online following.[60] In April 2008, several images of Cyrus in her underwear and swimsuit were leaked by a teenage hacker who accessed her Gmail account.[61][62] Further controversy arose when it was reported that Cyrus, then fifteen, had posed topless during a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for Vanity Fair.[63] The New York Times later clarified that although the pictures left the impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bed sheet and was not topless.[64]
Cyrus went on to release her second studio album, Breakout (2008), in June of that year.[65] The album boasted the highest first week sales of her career thus far, and became her third to top the Billboard 200.[66][67] Cyrus later starred with John Travolta in the animated film Bolt (2008), her debut as a theatrical actress.[68] The film was a critical and commercial success earning her a Golden Globe nomination.[69]
In March 2009, Cyrus released "The Climb" (2009) as a single from the soundtrack to the Hannah Montana feature film.[70] It was met with a warm critical and commercial reaction, becoming a crossover hit in both pop and country music formats.[71] The soundtrack, which features the single, went on to become Cyrus' fourth entry to top the Billboard 200; this made her, at sixteen, the youngest performer in history to have four number one albums on the chart.[72] She released her fourth soundtrack as "Hannah Montana" in July 2009, which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.[73] Cyrus later launched her first fashion line, Miley Cyrus and Max Azria, through Walmart.[74] It was promoted by the release of "Party in the U.S.A." (2009) and the EP The Time of Our Lives (2009).[75][76] Cyrus said the album was "a transitioning album [...] really to introduce people to what I want my next record to sound like and with time I will be able to do that a little more".[76] "Party in the U.S.A." went on to become one of Cyrus' most successful singles to date, and is considered one of her signature songs.[77] She next embarked on her first world tour, the Wonder World Tour (2009), which was a critical and commercial success.[78] On December 7, 2009, Cyrus performed for Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the British Royal Family at the Royal Variety Performance in Blackpool, Lancashire.[79]
Billboard ranked her as the fourth, best-selling female artist of 2009.[80]
Hoping to foster a more mature image, Cyrus starred in the film The Last Song (2010), based on the Nicholas Sparks novel.[81] It garnered a generally negative critical reaction,[82] though it was a box office hit.[83][84] Cyrus further attempted to change her image with the release of her third studio album, Can't Be Tamed (2010).[85] The album featured a more dance-oriented sound than her prior releases, and caused a considerable amount of controversy because of its lyrical content and Cyrus' live performances.[86][87][88][89] It sold 106,000 copies in its first week of release, and became her first studio album not to top the Billboard 200 chart in the United States.[90] Due to the controversy surrounding the release, the album's second, and final single, "Who Owns My Heart" was released solely in select European territories.[91][92] Cyrus released her final soundtrack as "Hannah Montana" that October; it was a commercial failure.[citation needed]
Cyrus was the center of more controversy when a video posted online in December 2010 showed a then eighteen Cyrus smoking salvia with a bong.[93][94][95] 2010 ended with her ranked number thirteen on Forbes Celebrity 100 list.[96]
She embarked on her worldwide Gypsy Heart Tour (2011) in April, which featured no North American dates.[97] Cyrus cited her various controversial moments as the reason behind this, claiming she only wanted to travel where she felt "the most love".[98][99] Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus officially parted ways with longtime record label Hollywood Records.[100] With Hannah Montana now officially over, Cyrus announced that she planned to take a hiatus from music to focus on her film career.[101] She later confirmed she would not be going to college for the time being.[102][103]
Cyrus hosted the March 5, 2011, episode of Saturday Night Live, during which she performed in a number of skits and poked fun at her recent controversies.[104][105] She later made an appearance on the MTV series Punk'd, appearing with Kelly Osbourne and Khloé Kardashian.[106][107] Cyrus starred in the independent film LOL (2012) with Demi Moore.[108] The film had a limited release, and was critically and commercially unsuccessful.[109][110][111] She then starred in the comedy film So Undercover, appearing as an FBI agent who is required to go undercover at a college sorority.[112]
Cyrus released a string of live performances known as the Backyard Sessions through YouTube during the spring and summer of 2012; the performances were of classic songs that Cyrus personally liked.[113] Having begun working on a failed fourth album the previous year, Cyrus resumed working on a new musical project in late 2012.[114] She collaborated with producers Rock Mafia on their song "Morning Sun" (2012), which was made available for free download online.[115] She had previously appeared in the music video for their debut single, "The Big Bang" (2010).[116] Cyrus later provided guest vocals on "Decisions" (2012) by Borgore.[117] Both Cyrus and Hemsworth appeared in the music video for the track.[118] She went on to appear as Missi in two episodes of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men.[119] Cyrus generated considerable media attention after cutting her traditionally long, brown hair in favor of a blonde, pixie cut; she commented that she had "never felt more [herself] in [her] whole life" and that "it really changed [her] life".[120][121]
In 2013, Cyrus hired Larry Rudolph to be her manager (though she is currently managed by Maverick's Adam Leber); Rudolph is best known for representing Britney Spears.[122][123] It was soon confirmed that Cyrus had signed a new recording contract with RCA Records to distribute her future releases.[124] She worked with producers such as Pharrell Williams and Mike Will Made-It on her fourth studio album, resulting in a hip-hop influenced sound.[125] She collaborated with numerous hip-hop artists' releases and[125] appeared on the Snoop Lion song "Ashtrays and Heartbreaks" (2013), released as the lead single from his twelfth studio album, Reincarnated, in April 2013.[126] She worked with will.i.am on the song "Fall Down" (2013), released as a promotional single that same month.[127] The song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number fifty-eight, marking her first appearance on the chart since "Can't Be Tamed" (2010).[128] She provided guest vocals on the Lil Twist song "Twerk", which also featured vocals by Justin Bieber.[129] The song went unreleased for unknown reasons, though it was leaked online.[129] On May 23, 2013, it was confirmed that Cyrus would be featured on the Mike Will Made It single "23", with Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J.[130] The single went on to peak at number eleven on the Hot 100, and had sold over one million copies worldwide as of 2013.[131]

Cyrus released her new single "We Can't Stop" on June 3.[132] Touted as her comeback single, it went on to become a worldwide commercial success, topping the charts in territories such as the United Kingdom.[133][134] The song's music video set the Vevo record for most views within twenty-four hours of release, and became the first to reach 100 million views on the site.[135] Cyrus performed with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, a performance that resulted in widespread media attention and public scrutiny. Her simulated sex acts with a foam finger were described as "disturbing", and the whole performance as "cringe-worthy".[136][137] Cyrus released "Wrecking Ball" (2013) as the second single from Bangerz on the same day as the VMAs.[138] The accompanying music video showing her swinging naked on a wrecking ball was viewed over nineteen million times within its first day of release.[138][137] The single became Cyrus' first single to top the Hot 100 chart in the United States having sold over two million copies.[139]On October 2, MTV aired the documentary Miley: The Movement, that chronicled the recording of her fourth studio album Bangerz,[140][141] which was released on October 4.[142] It was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 270,000 copies.[143] On October 5, Cyrus hosted Saturday Night Live for the second time.[144] On November fifth, rapper Future's "Real and True" was released as a single featuring Cyrus and Mr. Hudson; an accompanying music video premiered five days later on November 10, 2013.[145] In late 2013 she was declared Artist of the Year by MTV.[146] On January 29, 2014, she played an acoustic concert show on MTV Unplugged, performing songs from Bangerz featuring a guest appearance by Madonna.[147] It became the highest rated MTV Unplugged in the past decade with over 1.7 million streams.[148] Cyrus was also featured in the Marc Jacobs spring 2014 ad campaign along with Natalie Westling and Esmerelda Seay Reynolds.[149] She launched her controversial Bangerz Tour (2014) that year, which received a generally positive reception.[150][151] About two months into her tour, Cyrus' Alaskan Klee Kai was found mauled to death at her home after fighting with a coyote. The trauma from the incident inspired her to dedicate her life to veganism.[152] Two weeks later, Cyrus suffered an allergic reaction to the antibiotic cephalexin, prescribed to treat a sinus infection,[153] resulting in her hospitalization in Kansas City. Though she rescheduled some of her US tour dates, she resumed the tour two weeks later, beginning with the European leg.[154]
While collaborating with The Flaming Lips on their remake of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, With a Little Help from My Fwends,[155][156] Cyrus began working with Wayne Coyne on her fifth studio album.[157] She claimed that she was taking her time to focus on the music, and that the album would not be released until she felt it was ready.[158] Coyne compared his collaborative material with Cyrus to the catalogs of Pink Floyd and Portishead, and described their sound as being "a slightly wiser, sadder, more true version" of Cyrus' pop music output.[159] Cyrus also worked on the films The Night Before (2015) and A Very Murray Christmas (2015) during this period; both roles were cameos.[160] Reports began to surface in 2015 that Cyrus was working on two albums simultaneously, one of which she hoped to release at no charge.[161] This was confirmed by her manager who claimed she was willing to end her contract with RCA Records if they refused to let her release a free album.[161] Cyrus was the host of the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the first openly pansexual host of those awards, and gave a surprise performance of a new song "Dooo It!" (2015) during the show's finale.[162][163] Immediately following the performance, Cyrus announced that her fifth studio album, Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), was available for free streaming on SoundCloud.[163] The album was written and produced primarily by Cyrus, and has been called experimental and psychedelic,[164][165][166] with elements of psychedelic pop,[167][168] psychedelic rock,[169] and alternative pop.[170]

It was released on Netflix on June 5, 2019.[199] In the episode, she portrays the fictional pop star Ashley O and provides the voice for her AI doll extension, Ashley Too.

Cyrus cites Elvis Presley as her biggest inspiration.[206] She has also cited artists such as Madonna, Lana Del Rey, Dolly Parton, Timbaland, Joan Jett, Lil Kim, Shania Twain, Hanson, OneRepublic and Britney Spears as influences.[207][208][209][210][211][212][213] Since the start of her musical career, Cyrus has been described as being predominantly a pop artist.[214] Her Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus debut studio effort was characterized as sounding similar to her releases as "Hannah Montana" featuring a pop-rock and bubblegum pop sound.[215][216] Cyrus hoped that the release of Breakout (2008) would help distance her from this sound; the project features Cyrus experimenting with various genres.[217][218] Cyrus co-wrote eight songs for the album, and was quoted as saying: "I just hope this record showcases that, more than anything, I'm a writer."[67] The songs on her early releases feature lyrics on the topics of love and relationships.[214]
Cyrus's vocal range is mezzo-soprano,[219] but according to mtv.com, her vocals were once described as an alto,[220] with a "Nashville twang" in both her speech and singing voice. Her voice also has a distinctive raspy sound to it similar in vein to Pink and Amy Winehouse[105] On "Party in the U.S.A." (2009), her vocals feature belter refrains,[221] while those on the song "Obsessed" (2009) are described as "husky".[222] Releases such as "The Climb" (2009) and "These Four Walls" (2008) feature elements of country music and showcase Cyrus's "twangy vocals".[223] Cyrus experiments with an electropop sound on "Fly on the Wall" (2008), a genre that she would explore further with the release of Can't Be Tamed (2010), her third studio album.[224] It was initially intended to feature rock music elements prior to its completion,[225] and Cyrus claimed after its release that it could be her final pop album.[226] The album's songs speak of Cyrus' desire to achieve freedom in both her personal life and her career.[226] She began working on Bangerz (2013) during a musical hiatus, and described the project as having a "dirty south feel" prior to its release.[227] Critics noted the use of hip hop music and synthpop in the album.[228] The album's songs are placed in chronological order telling the story of her failed relationship with Liam Hemsworth.[229] Cyrus described Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) as "a little psychedelic, but still in that pop world".[158]
Cyrus has become known for her controversial performances, such as during her Bangerz Tour (2014) and Milky Milky Milk Tour (2015).[230] Her performance of "Party In the U.S.A." at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards sparked a "national uproar" because of her outfit and her perceived pole dancing.[231][232] She faced similar controversy following a performance of "Can't Be Tamed" (2010) on Britain's Got Talent, where she pretended to kiss one of her female dancers on stage.[233] Cyrus defended the performance, feeling she did nothing wrong.[233] Cyrus was the subject of public and media scrutiny following her performance of "We Can't Stop" (2013) and "Blurred Lines" (2013) with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Clad in a skin colored latex two-piece, Cyrus touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch.[234] Shortly thereafter, the word "twerk" was added to the online version of the Oxford Dictionary of English.[235] The performance resulted in a media frenzy; one reviewer likened the performance to a "bad acid trip",[136] while another described it as a "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment".[236] Cyrus entered the stage of her Bangerz Tour (2014) by sliding down a slide in the shape of a tongue, gaining media attention during the tour for her costumes and racy performances.[237]
Throughout her career, Cyrus has sung on several charity singles such as: "Just Stand Up!", "Send It On", "Everybody Hurts" and "We Are the World 25 for Haiti".[238][239][240][241] She has visited a number of sick fans in hospitals throughout the years.[242][243] She is an avid supporter of the City of Hope National Medical Center in California, having attended benefit concerts in 2008, 2009 and 2012.[244][245][246] In 2008 and 2009, during her Best of Both Worlds and Wonder World Tours, for every concert ticket sold, she donated one dollar to the organization.[247] Cyrus celebrated her sixteenth birthday at Disneyland by delivering a $1 million donation from Disney to Youth Service America.[248] In July 2009, Cyrus performed at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation's 20th annual A Time for Heroes celebrity picnic[249] and donated several items including autographed merchandise, and a script from Hannah Montana for the Ronald McDonald House Auction.[250] Cyrus supports charities such as: the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Entertainment Industry Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, United Service Organizations, Youth Service America and Music for Relief.[251][252][253][254][255][256] In February 2010, she donated several items, including the dress she wore to the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, and two tickets to the Hollywood premiere of her movie The Last Song, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[257]
In January 2011, Cyrus met an ailing fan with spina bifida with the charity Kids Wish Network.[258] In April 2011, she appeared in a commercial for the American Red Cross asking people to pledge $10 to help those affected by the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami.[259] In the same year Hilary Duff presented Cyrus with the first ever Global Action Youth Leadership Award at the first Annual Global Action Awards Gala for her support of Blessings in a Backpack, an organization that works to feed hungry children in schools, and her personal Get Ur Good On campaign with the Youth Services of America. Cyrus stated: "I want (kids) to do something they love.

She had met him at My Friend's Place, an organization that helps homeless youth find shelter, work, health care and education. His acceptance speech encouraged musicians to learn more about homeless youth in Los Angeles and what they can do to help at Cyrus's Facebook page.[275] Cyrus then launched a Prizeo campaign to raise funds for the charity.

It was aimed at encouraging diversity and tolerance by showing these people in a positive light as examples for others who might be struggling to figure themselves out, as well as a reference point for people who didn't know personally anyone in that situation. Cyrus was the one behind the camera for the photoshoot the whole time and even interviewed her 14 subjects to share their personal stories along with their portraits. She decided to predominate the color yellow since she believes it is a happy and not sexualized color.

On December 23, Cyrus and Hemsworth married in a private wedding ceremony in their home in Nashville, Tennessee.[334] She felt that her marriage "[redefined] what it looks like for someone that's a queer person like [herself] to be in a hetero relationship" though she was "still very sexually attracted to women". Cyrus indicated that the ceremony was "kind of out of character for [her]" because "[they have] worn rings forever [and] definitely didn't need it in any way". She believed the loss of their home to be the catalyst for getting married, citing that "the timing felt right" and that "no one is promised the next day, or the next, so [she tries] to be 'in the now' as much as possible".[335] On August 10, 2019, Cyrus announced their separation.[336] Eleven days later, Hemsworth filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences".[337] To commemorate her divorce from Hemsworth, Cyrus had a note written to her from Yoko Ono tattooed on her left shoulder blade.[338] On January 28, 2020, it was announced that their divorce had been finalized.[339]
