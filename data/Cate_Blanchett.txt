 Blanchett was born on 14 May 1969 in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe.[6] Her Australian mother, June Blanchett (born Gamble),[7] worked as a property developer and teacher, and her American father, Robert DeWitt Blanchett, Jr., a Texas native, was a United States Navy Chief Petty Officer who later worked as an advertising executive.[8][9][10] The two met when Blanchett's father's ship broke down in Melbourne.[11] When Blanchett was 10, her father died of a heart attack, leaving her mother to raise the family on her own.[12][13] Blanchett is the middle of three children, she has an older brother Bob Blanchett (born 1968), and a younger sister Genevieve Blanchett (born 1971).[12] Her ancestry includes English, some Scottish, and remote French roots.[13][14][15]
Blanchett has described herself as being "part extrovert, part wallflower" during childhood.[12] She had a penchant for dressing in traditionally masculine clothing, and went through goth and punk phases during her teenage years, and shaved her head at one point.[12] She attended primary school in Melbourne at Ivanhoe East Primary School; for her secondary education, she attended Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar School and then Methodist Ladies' College, where she explored her passion for the performing arts.[16] In her late teens and early twenties, she worked at a nursing home in Victoria.[17] She studied economics and fine arts at the University of Melbourne but dropped out after one year to travel overseas. While in Egypt, Blanchett was asked to play an American cheerleader, as an extra in the Egyptian boxing movie, Kaboria; in need of money, she accepted.[12][18] Upon returning to Australia, and after working in the pocket theatres of Melbourne, including La Mama, she moved to Sydney, and enrolled at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA).[18] She graduated from NIDA in 1992 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.[12]
Blanchett's first major stage role was opposite Geoffrey Rush, in the 1992 David Mamet play Oleanna for the Sydney Theatre Company. That year, she was also cast as Clytemnestra in a production of Sophocles' Electra. A couple of weeks after rehearsals, the actress playing the title role pulled out, and director Lindy Davies cast Blanchett in the role. Her performance as Electra became one of her most acclaimed at NIDA.[11] In 1993, Blanchett was awarded the Sydney Theatre Critics' Best Newcomer Award for her performance in Timothy Daly's Kafka Dances and won Best Actress for her performance in Mamet's Oleanna, making her the first actor to win both categories in the same year.[11] Blanchett played the role of Ophelia in an acclaimed 1994–1995 Company B production of Hamlet directed by Neil Armfield, starring Rush and Richard Roxburgh, and was nominated for a Green Room Award.[19] She appeared in the 1994 TV miniseries Heartland opposite Ernie Dingo, the miniseries Bordertown (1995) with Hugo Weaving, and in an episode of Police Rescue entitled "The Loaded Boy".[20][21] She also appeared in the 50-minute drama short Parklands (1996), which received an Australian Film Institute (AFI) nomination for Best Original Screenplay.[22][23]
Blanchett made her feature film debut with a supporting role as an Australian nurse captured by the Japanese Army during World War II, in Bruce Beresford's film Paradise Road (1997), which co-starred Glenn Close and Frances McDormand.[13] Her first leading role was as Lucinda Leplastrier in Gillian Armstrong's romantic drama Oscar and Lucinda (1997), opposite Ralph Fiennes.[13] Blanchett received wide acclaim for her performance,[18] and earned her first AFI Award nomination as Best Leading Actress; she lost to Deborah Mailman in Radiance (1998).[24] She won the AFI Best Actress Award in the same year for her role as Lizzie in the romantic comedy Thank God He Met Lizzie (1997), co-starring Richard Roxburgh and Frances O'Connor.[18] By 1997, Blanchett had accrued significant praise and recognition in her native Australia.[18]
Her first high-profile international role was as Elizabeth I of England in the critically acclaimed film Elizabeth (1998), directed by Shekhar Kapur. The film catapulted her to stardom, and her performance garnered wide recognition, earning her the Golden Globe Award and British Academy Award (BAFTA), and her first Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.[11][19] The following year, Blanchett appeared in Bangers (1999), an Australian short film part of Stories of Lost Souls, a compilation of thematically-related short stories. The short was written and directed by her husband, Andrew Upton, and produced by Blanchett and Upton.[25][26] She also appeared in the Mike Newell comedy Pushing Tin (1999), costarring Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie (critics singled out Blanchett's performance),[18] and the critically acclaimed Anthony Minghella film The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), alongside Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. She received her second BAFTA nomination for her performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley.[13]
Already an acclaimed actress, Blanchett received a host of new fans when she starred in Peter Jackson's Academy Award-winning blockbuster trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, playing the role of Galadriel in all three films.[13] In addition to The Lord of the Rings, 2001 also saw Blanchett diversify her portfolio with a range of roles in the dramas Charlotte Gray and The Shipping News and the American crime-comedy Bandits, for which she earned a second Golden Globe and SAG Award nomination.[27]
In 2002, Blanchett appeared, opposite Giovanni Ribisi, in Tom Tykwer-directed Heaven, the first film in an unfinished trilogy by acclaimed writer-director Krzysztof Kieślowski.[19][28] 2003 saw Blanchett again playing a wide range of roles: Galadriel in the third and final instalment of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture); the Ron Howard-directed western-thriller The Missing; Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes – playing two roles (both against herself) – for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination; and the biographical film Veronica Guerin, which earned her a Golden Globe Best Actress Drama nomination.[19]
In 2005, she won her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her acclaimed portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator.[29] This made Blanchett the first actor to win an Academy Award for portraying an Academy Award-winning actor.[30] She lent her Oscar statuette to the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.[31] That year, Blanchett won the Australian Film Institute Best Actress Award for her role as Tracy Heart, a former heroin addict, in the Australian film Little Fish, co-produced by her and her husband's production company, Dirty Films.[25] Though lesser known globally than some of her other films, Little Fish received great critical acclaim in Blanchett's native Australia and was nominated for 13 Australian Film Institute awards.[32][33]
In 2006, she starred opposite Brad Pitt in the multi-lingual, multi-narrative ensemble drama Babel, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, which received seven Academy Award nominations; the Steven Soderbergh-directed drama The Good German with George Clooney, and the acclaimed psychological thriller Notes on a Scandal opposite Dame Judi Dench.[18][19] Blanchett received a third Academy Award nomination for her performance in the latter film.[34]
In 2007, Blanchett was named as one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World and also one of the most successful actresses by Forbes magazine.[35] Blanchett had a cameo as Janine, forensic scientist and ex-girlfriend of Simon Pegg's character in Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz (2007). The cameo was uncredited and she gave her fee to charity.[36][37] She reprised her role as Queen Elizabeth I in the 2007 sequel Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and portrayed Jude Quinn, one of six incarnations of Bob Dylan in Todd Haynes' experimental film I'm Not There. She won the Volpi Cup Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival (accepted by fellow Australian actor and I'm Not There co-star Heath Ledger), the Independent Spirit and Golden Globe Best Supporting Actress Award for her portrayal of Jude Quinn.[38] At the 80th Academy Awards, Blanchett received two Academy Award nominations – Best Actress for Elizabeth: the Golden Age and Best Supporting Actress for I'm Not There – becoming the eleventh actor to receive two acting nominations in the same year, and the first female actor to receive another nomination for the reprisal of a role.[39] Of her achievement that year, critic Roger Ebert said, "That Blanchett could appear in the same Toronto International Film Festival playing Elizabeth and Bob Dylan, both splendidly, is a wonder of acting".[40]
She next appeared in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, as the villainous KGB agent Col. Dr. Irina Spalko, Spielberg's favourite villain from the entire series,[41] and in David Fincher's Oscar-nominated The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, co-starring with Brad Pitt for a second time. Blanchett voiced the character of Granmamare for the English version of the film Ponyo, released July 2008.[42] On 5 December 2008, Blanchett was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard in front of Grauman's Egyptian Theatre.[43]
In 2008, Blanchett and her husband became co-CEOs and artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company (STC).[44][45] Blanchett returned to acting in the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion.[46][47]
A Streetcar Named Desire production traveled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.[48][49] It was critically and commercially successful and Blanchett received critical acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois.[10][50][51][52] The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, "DuBois has been pulled gently and firmly down to earth by Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Ullmann ... What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct ... Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play as if it had never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, "you feel like you're hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time.""[53] The Washington Post's Peter Marks proclaimed, "What Blanchett achieves in the Sydney Theatre Company's revelatory revival of "A Streetcar Named Desire" amounts to a truly great portrayal – certainly the most heartbreaking Blanche I've ever experienced."[54] John Lahr of The New Yorker said of her portrayal, "Blanchett, with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, gets it right from the first beat ... Blanchett doesn't make the usual mistake of foreshadowing Blanche's end at the play's beginning; she allows Blanche a slow, fascinating decline ... I don't expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime."[55] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen",[56] and Meryl Streep declared, "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... She took the layers of a person and just peeled them away. I thought I'd seen that play, I thought I knew all the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance."[57] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[58] The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.[59]
In 2010, Blanchett appeared opposite Russell Crowe in Ridley Scott's epic war film Robin Hood. In 2011, she played the antagonist CIA agent Marissa Wiegler in Joe Wright's action thriller film Hanna.
In 2011, Blanchett took part in two Sydney Theatre Company productions. She played Lotte Kotte in a new translation of Botho Strauß's 1978 play Groß und klein (Big and Small) from Martin Crimp, directed by Benedict Andrews.[60] After its Sydney run, the production traveled to London, Paris, the Vienna Festival and Ruhrfestspiele.[10] Blanchett and the production received wide acclaim.[61][62][63][64][65] Blanchett was nominated for the London Evening Standard Award for Best Actress,[66] and won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role[67] and the Helpmann Award for Best Actress.[68] She then played Yelena, opposite Hugo Weaving and Richard Roxburgh, in Andrew Upton's adaptation of Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, which traveled to the Kennedy Center and the New York City Center as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.[69] The production and Blanchett received critical acclaim,[7][70][71] with The New York Times' Ben Brantley declaring, "I consider the three hours I spent on Saturday night watching [the characters] complain about how bored they are among the happiest of my theatregoing life ... This Uncle Vanya gets under your skin like no other I have seen ... [Blanchett] confirms her status as one of the best and bravest actresses on the planet."[72] The Washington Post's Peter Marks dubbed the production Washington D.C's top theatrical event of 2011.[7] Blanchett received the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production, and the Helpmann Award for Best Actress.[68][73]
Blanchett reprised her role as Galadriel in Peter Jackson's adaptations of The Hobbit (2012–2014), prequel to The Lord of the Rings series, filmed in New Zealand.[74] She voiced the role of "Penelope" in the Family Guy episode "Mr. and Mrs. Stewie", which aired on 29 April 2012, and Queen Elizabeth II in the episode "Family Guy Viewer Mail 2".[75][76] Blanchett returned to Australian film with her appearance in The Turning (2013), an anthology film based on a collection of short stories by Tim Winton.[77] She was head of jury of the 2012 and 2013 Dubai International Film Festival.[78] The Sydney Theatre Company's 2013 season was Blanchett's final one as co-CEO and artistic director.[44][79]
In 2013, Blanchett played Jasmine French, the lead role in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine, co-starring Alec Baldwin and Sally Hawkins. Her performance received critical acclaim, with some critics considering it to be the finest of her career to that point (surpassing her acclaimed performance in Elizabeth).[80] The performance earned her more than 40 industry and critics awards, including LAFCA Award, NYFCC Award, NSFC Award, Critics' Choice Award, Santa Barbara International Film Festival Outstanding Performance of the Year Award, SAG Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Independent Film Spirit Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress.[81] Blanchett's win made her just the sixth actress to win an Oscar in both of the acting categories, the third to win Best Actress after Best Supporting Actress, and the first Australian to win more than one acting Oscar.[82][83][84]
Allen's daughter Dylan Farrow has since criticized Blanchett and other actresses for working with Allen.[85][86] Blanchett responded, "It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some resolution and peace."[87] In response to questions about her advocacy for women in Hollywood as part of the Me Too movement, Blanchett stated that the justice system, and not social media, should be the "judge and jury" in such cases.[88][89]

After making Brighton, England their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006.[144][145] In November 2006, Blanchett attributed this move to desires to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and to have a sense of belonging to the Australian theatrical community.[146] She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill.[147] Their Hunters Hill residence underwent extensive renovations in 2007 to be made more eco-friendly.[148] Following the sale of their property there in late 2015, Blanchett and Upton purchased a house in East Sussex, England in early 2016.[149]
Blanchett has spoken about feminism and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 that she was concerned that "a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe" was threatening women's role in society.[150] She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: "Honestly, I think about my appearance less than I did ten years ago. People talk about the golden age of Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date."[151]
