Page first acted in front of the camera in 1997 at age ten in the CBC television movie Pit Pony, which later spun off into a television series.

Page was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scene Stealer for the role.
Page portrayed the titular character in the 2007 film Juno. Film critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times described her as "frighteningly talented"[10] and Roger Ebert said, "Has there been a better performance this year than Ellen Page's creation of Juno? I do not think so."[11] Page was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, but lost to Marion Cotillard in La Vie en Rose. The role, however, did win her more than 20 awards, including a Canadian Comedy Award, an Independent Spirit Award, and a Satellite Award besides the likes of numerous Critics awards including Detroit Film Critics Society, Austin Film Critics Association and Florida Film Critics Circle.
