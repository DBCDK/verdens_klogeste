Giannis Sina Ougko Antetokounmpo (YAH-nis AHN-teh-tuh-KOOM-poh; Greek: Γιάννης Αντετοκούνμπο,[1] IPA: [ˈʝanis adetoˈkumbo]; born December 6, 1994)[2] is a Greek professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Born in Greece to Nigerian parents, Antetokounmpo began playing basketball for the youth teams of Filathlitikos in Athens. In 2011, he began playing for the club's senior team before entering the 2013 NBA Draft, where he was selected 15th overall by the Bucks. Antetokounmpo's combination of size, speed and ball-handling skills led to his nickname the "Greek Freak".
In 2016–17 he led the Bucks in all five major statistical categories and became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all five statistics of total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.[3] He received the Most Improved Player award in 2017. He has received three All-Star selections, and led the Eastern Conference in voting in 2019. In June 2019, he was named the NBA Most Valuable Player.
Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6, 1994, the son of immigrants from Nigeria.[4][5][6] Three years earlier, his parents had moved from Lagos, leaving behind their firstborn son, Francis, with his grandparents.[7] Though Antetokounmpo and three of his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically receive full Greek citizenship as the Greek nationality law abides by the jus sanguinis.[5] For the first 18 years of his life Antetokounmpo was effectively stateless, having no papers from Nigeria or Greece.[8]
Antetokounmpo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia.[6] His parents, as immigrants, could not easily find work, so Antetokounmpo and his older brother, Thanasis, helped by hawking watches, handbags and sunglasses in the streets.[9] In 2007, Antetokounmpo started playing basketball,[8] and was playing competitively for the youth squad of Filathlitikos by 2009. He was baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church along with his brother Alexandros on October 28, 2012.[10]
In 2011 Antetokounmpo played with the senior men's team of Filathlitikos in the semi-pro Greek B Basket League (third Division) during the 2011–12 season.[11] In the 2012–13 season he played in the Greek A2 League, Greece's second division.
In December 2012, a few days after turning 18, Antetokounmpo signed a four-year deal with Spanish club CAI Zaragoza,[12] reportedly including NBA buyouts after each season. A number of other major European clubs had been interested in adding him, including Barcelona and Efes.[5] With the contract starting with the 2013–14 season, he decided to stay with the Filathlitikos for the remainder of the 2012–13 season.
During the 2012–13 Greek A2 League season, Antetokounmpo shot 46.4% from the field (62.1% on two-point field goals), 31.3% from three-point range, and 72.0% from the free throw line, while averaging 22.5 minutes per game. Over 26 games, he averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game.[13] He was also selected by the coaches as a special participant in the 2013 Greek League All-Star Game. Even though he was not actually selected as an all-star, the coaches let him play in the game as a treat for the fans.[14]
On April 28, 2013, Antetokounmpo officially made himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft.[15] He fulfilled his draft projections as a first-round pick by being selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. On July 30, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks.[16][17]
Antetokounmpo made his NBA debut on October 13, 2013 at the age of 18 years, 311 days, as one of the youngest NBA players ever. He averaged 6.8 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.8 steals, and 0.8 blocks in 77 appearances during his rookie season. He scored in double figures 23 times and grabbed 10+ rebounds twice, with both efforts resulting in double-doubles. He finished the season with 61 total blocks, which led all NBA rookies and was the seventh-most by a Bucks rookie in franchise history. He was selected to participate in the Rising Stars Challenge at NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans, where he tallied nine points, two rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes. At the season's end, he was named to the 2013–14 NBA All-Rookie second team.[18]
On October 16, 2014, the Bucks exercised their third-year team option on Antetokounmpo's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season.[19] On February 6, 2015, he recorded a then career-high 27 points and 15 rebounds in a loss to the Houston Rockets.[20] Three days later, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played February 2–8, earning Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career.[21] He later competed in the 2015 NBA Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All-Star Weekend in New York. On March 9, he scored a then career-high 29 points on 11-of-16 shooting in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[22] The Bucks finished the regular season with a 41–41 record, good for sixth in the Eastern Conference.

The award marked the first of Antetokounmpo's career and the first for a Buck since Michael Redd won the award in January 2004. Antetokounmpo joined Redd, Terry Cummings (January 1985) and Sidney Moncrief (December 1981) as the only four Bucks players to be named Eastern Conference Player of the Month.[48] Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks finish an Eastern Conference-best 14–4 in March, the franchise's first calendar month with at least 14 victories since going 16–2 in February 1971. He averaged 22.4 points (ninth in the East), 8.4 rebounds (10th in the East), 4.8 assists, 1.78 blocked shots (fourth in the East) and 1.33 steals in 18 games during the month.[49]  Antetokounmpo led the Bucks in every one of the five major statistical categories (points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks) in the 2016–17 regular season, becoming only the fifth NBA player to do so after Dave Cowens, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett and LeBron James.[50] He also became the first player in NBA history to finish in the top 20 in the league in each of the five major categories in a regular season.[51] As a result of his efforts, Antetokounmpo was named to the All-NBA Second Team, earning his first All-NBA honor.[52] He was also named the recipient of the NBA Most Improved Player Award for the 2016–17 season, becoming the first player in Bucks history to be named Most Improved Player.[53]

At the NBA's end-of-season awards night, Antetokounmpo was named the league's Most Valuable Player.

Antetokounmpo's father, Charles, was a former Nigerian association football player, while his mother, Veronica, is a former high jumper.[7] Charles died in September 2017, at age 54.[58] Veronica gave each of her five sons both Greek and Nigerian names, choosing the Nigerian Ougko (/ˈuːɡoʊ/ OO-goh) for Giannis.[104][105] His parents are from different Nigerian ethnic groups—Charles was Yoruba, while Veronica is Igbo. According to basketball great Hakeem Olajuwon, also a Yoruba, the original family name of Adetokunbo translates to "the crown has returned from overseas".[106]
Antetokounmpo has two older brothers, Francis (Greek name Andreas) and Thanasis, as well as two younger brothers, Kostas and Alexis.[107] He and Thanasis were teammates in Filathlitikos, with Kostas later joining the squad in the 2013–14 season. His oldest brother, Francis, has played football professionally in Nigeria, and both basketball and football professionally in Greece.
Following their son and brother, the entire Antetokounmpo family, except for Francis and Thanasis, moved from Athens to Milwaukee in early 2014.[108] In July 2016, Giannis and Thanasis began their mandatory military service in Greece. The two brothers served a reduced three-month military service, as prescribed for Greek citizens who are permanent overseas residents.[109]
Thanasis made his NBA debut with the New York Knicks after being drafted by the organization with the 51st overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft.[110] He is now with the Milwaukee Bucks.[111] Antetokounmpo's younger brother, Kostas, played college basketball for Dayton before being selected with the last pick in the 2018 NBA draft.[112] He currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. Their youngest brother, Alexis, plays high school basketball in the US.[113]
Giannis is a devoted Christian and was raised in the Greek Orthodox Church.[114]
