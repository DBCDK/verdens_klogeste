Miranda was born in New York City[1] and raised in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, the son of Dr. Luz Towns-Miranda, a clinical psychologist, and Luis A. Miranda, Jr., a Democratic Party consultant who advised New York City mayor Ed Koch.[9][10][11] Miranda has one older sister, Luz, who is the Chief Financial Officer of the MirRam Group.[12] During childhood and his teens, he spent at least one month each year with his grandparents in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico.[13][14] He is of mostly Puerto Rican descent. His mother's ancestors include an interracial couple, Sophie, who was black, and David Towns, who was white; from the early 1800s, this couple spent their married life trying to outrun slavery as laws and governments changed around them. Ensuing branches of the Towns family primarily married Mexican spouses in Texas and Mexico, and Miranda, for his part, has described his ancestry as a quarter Mexican.[11][15][16] The name "Lin-Manuel" was inspired by a poem about the Vietnam War, Nana roja para mi hijo Lin Manuel, by the Puerto Rican writer José Manuel Torres Santiago.[17][18]
Miranda attended Hunter College Elementary School and Hunter College High School,[19] where his classmates included journalist Chris Hayes, who was Miranda's first director when the latter starred in a school play described by Hayes as "a 20-minute musical that featured a maniacal fetal pig in a nightmare that [Miranda] had cut up in biology class",[20] and rapper Immortal Technique, who bullied Miranda during high school, although the two later became friends.[21][22] It was during high school that Miranda began writing musicals.[23]
As a student, Miranda wrote the earliest draft of what would become his first Broadway musical, In the Heights, in 1999, his sophomore year of college at Wesleyan University.[23] After the show was accepted by Wesleyan's student theater company, Second Stage, Miranda added freestyle rap and salsa numbers, and the show was premiered there in 1999.[14] Miranda wrote and directed several other musicals at Wesleyan, and acted in many other productions, ranging from musicals to Shakespeare. He graduated from Wesleyan in 2002.[14][24]
In 2002, Lin Manuel and John Buffalo Mailer worked with director Thomas Kail to revise In the Heights.[14][9][23] Playwright Quiara Alegría Hudes joined the team in 2004.[25][23] After success off-Broadway, the musical went to Broadway, opening in March 2008.[14] It was nominated for 13 Tony Awards, winning four, including Best Musical and Best Original Score.[3][23] It also won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.[4] Miranda's performance in the leading role of Usnavi earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Miranda left the cast of the Broadway production on February 15, 2009.[26]
Miranda reprised the role when the national tour of In the Heights played in Los Angeles from June 23 to July 25, 2010.[27][28] He again joined the tour in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[29] Miranda rejoined the Broadway cast as Usnavi from December 25, 2010 until the production closed on January 9, 2011, after 29 previews and 1,185 regular performances.[30]

A film adaptation of In the Heights has been in development since 2008 when Universal Pictures acquired the film rights, with Kenny Ortega set to direct, but the film was canceled in 2011, the year it was initially set to be released.[109][110][111] The following year, however, Miranda suggested that the film was once again under discussion and in 2016 it was announced that The Weinstein Company would be producing the film, with Jon M. Chu set to direct.[112] The film hit another roadblock in 2017 following the scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein's sexual misconduct, when playwright Quiara Alegria Hudes, who was set to serve as screenwriter, requested that Weinstein relinquish the film rights back to her and Miranda, which became official in April 2018.[113] The following month, Warner Bros. acquired the film rights and announced the film was back in development, once again with Chu attached to direct.[114] While Miranda has insisted since 2016 that he would not reprise his role as Usnavi in any potential film adaptation, it was announced in April 2019 that he would be in the film but playing the much smaller role of Piraguero, referred to as Piragua Guy in the musical.

The Miranda family donated approximately $1 million to bring the University of Puerto Rico theater up to par in order to use it as the venue for the musical's performance in January 2018. After tickets sold out in two hours for the three-week run, producers decided to move out of the university venue due to warnings of potential disruptions by a university workers' labor organization, and move the already-installed set to the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center in Santurce, where the performances ran from January 11 through 27th.
