Dakota Mayi Johnson was born on October 4, 1989, at Brackenridge Hospital in Austin, Texas,[2] to actors Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. At the time of her birth, her father was shooting the film The Hot Spot in Texas.[3] Her maternal grandparents are advertising executive and former child actor Peter Griffith and actress Tippi Hedren, and she is the niece of actress Tracy Griffith and production designer Clay A. Griffin. Her former stepfather is actor Antonio Banderas.[4] She has four paternal siblings, including actor Jesse Johnson, and two maternal siblings.
Because of her parents' work, Johnson spent the majority of her childhood in various locations with them on film sets.[5] though she spent extended amounts of time in Aspen and Woody Creek, Colorado,[6] where she worked during summers at the local market as a teenager.[7] She attended the Aspen Community School for a time.[8] "I was so consistently unmoored and discombobulated. I didn't have an anchor anywhere," Johnson recalled.[5] At an early age, Johnson was diagnosed with hyperactivity (ADHD)[9] and changed schools seven times.[10] She attended the Santa Catalina School in Monterey, California, for her freshman year of high school before transferring to New Roads School in Santa Monica, California.[11]
Johnson became interested in modeling at age 12 after a photo shoot with children of other celebrities for Teen Vogue,[12] and subsequently earned an income modeling while attending high school in Santa Monica.[5] Johnson has said that she was interested in acting as a child, having spent significant time on film sets with her parents, but that they discouraged her from pursuing it until she finished high school.[13] After high school, she applied to the Juilliard School in New York City, but was not accepted after she covered a Radiohead song.[5]
In 1999, Johnson made her film debut in Crazy in Alabama where she and her sister Stella Banderas played daughters to their real-life mother, Melanie Griffith. The film was directed by her then-stepfather, Antonio Banderas.

Johnson's breakthrough came when she starred as Anastasia "Ana" Steele in the erotic romantic drama film Fifty Shades of Grey, which was released in February 2015 and brought her international recognition.[25] Johnson won the role over Lucy Hale, Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Danielle Panabaker and Shailene Woodley. In answer to questions regarding her stance on gender rights with respect to her role in the Fifty Shades film series, Johnson said: "I'm proud of [the movie]. I completely disagree with people who think Ana's weak. I think she's actually stronger than he is. Everything she does is her choice. And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want to do with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that."[26]
On February 15, 2015, Johnson appeared on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary special and hosted SNL on February 28, 2015, making her the second daughter of a former SNL host (after Gwyneth Paltrow, whose mother Blythe Danner hosted during the show's seventh season in 1982) to host the show. Also in 2015, she reunited with her 21 Jump Street cast member Johnny Depp, playing the mother of his character's child in the feature film Black Mass.[27] In 2015, Johnson starred in Luca Guadagnino's thriller A Bigger Splash,[28] opposite Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes.[29] The same year saw the release of Cymbeline, a modern film adaptation of the William Shakespeare play, in which she starred opposite Ethan Hawke and Ed Harris.[30] She also played a lead in the 2016 comedy How to Be Single, with Leslie Mann and her Date and Switch co-star Nicholas Braun.[31]
Johnson trained in dance to prepare for Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria (2018), a supernatural horror film and remake of the 1977 film by Dario Argento, in which she plays an American dancer in Berlin who enrolls in an academy run by a coven of witches.[7] David Ehrlich of IndieWire described Johnson's performance in the film as "thrillingly unrepentant."[32] Also in 2018, she starred in Drew Goddard's neo-noir thriller Bad Times at the El Royale, with Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm and Chris Hemsworth.
