In 2013 Baldwin briefly hosted Up Late with Alec Baldwin on MSNBC.[41] On November 26, 2013, the program was cancelled after only five episodes,[42] due in part to a street tirade captured on video. TMZ claimed Baldwin's insult toward the videographer was "cocksucking fag".[43][44][45] Baldwin, who denied that he used the word "fag", later cited this incident as a major turning point in his public life.[46]
In 2016 Baldwin began hosting a reboot of the game show Match Game on ABC. In 2017, he took over as sole host of TCM's The Essentials following the death of his co-host, Robert Osborne.

Baldwin directed and starred in The Devil and Daniel Webster with Anthony Hopkins, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Dan Aykroyd in 2001.[51] The then-unreleased film became an asset in a federal bank fraud trial when investor Jed Barron was convicted of bank fraud while the movie was in production. The film was eventually acquired by The Yari Group without Baldwin's involvement.[52]
In 2007 the Yari Film Group announced that it would give the film, now titled Shortcut to Happiness, a theatrical release in the spring, and cable film network Starz! announced that it had acquired pay TV rights for the film. Shortcut to Happiness was finally released in 2008. Baldwin, displeased with the way the film had been cut in post-production, demanded that his directorial credit be changed to the pseudonym "Harry Kirkpatrick".[53]

In 1990, Baldwin met actress Kim Basinger when they played lovers in the film The Marrying Man.[71] They married in 1993[72] and had a daughter, Ireland, in 1995.[73] They separated in 2000,[71] and finalized a divorce in 2002.
Baldwin chronicled his seven-year battle to remain a part of his daughter's life in his 2008 book, co-authored with Mark Tabb, A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce.[74][75] Baldwin contends that after their separation in December 2000, Basinger endeavored to deny him access to his daughter by refusing to discuss parenting,[76] blocking visitation,[77] not providing telephone access,[78] not following court orders,[79] not dropping their daughter off for reasons of convenience,[80] and directly lobbying the child.[81] He contends that she spent over $1.5 million in the effort.[82] Baldwin called this "parental alienation syndrome."[83]
Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case "opportunists", and has characterized Basinger's psychologists as part of the "divorce industry". He has faulted them more than Basinger, and writes, "In fact, I blame my ex-wife least of all for what has transpired. She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there. Nothing off the menu, ever."[84] Baldwin wrote that he spent over a million dollars,[85] has had to put time aside from his career,[86] has had to travel extensively,[87] and needed to find a house in California (he lived in New York),[88] so that he could stay in his daughter's life.[74]
Baldwin contended that after seven years of these issues, he hit a breaking point, and on April 11, 2007, left an angry voicemail message in response to another unanswered arranged call, in which Baldwin called his 11-year-old daughter a "rude, thoughtless little pig".[89] He contends that the tape was sold to TMZ which released the recording, despite laws against publishing media related to a minor without the permission of both parents.[90] Baldwin admitted that he made a mistake, but asked not to be judged as a parent based on a bad moment.[91] He later admitted to Playboy in June 2009 that he contemplated suicide over the voicemail that leaked to the public. Of the incident, he said, "I spoke to a lot of professionals, who helped me. If I committed suicide, [Kim Basinger] would have considered that a victory. Destroying me was their avowed goal."[92]
In late 2008, Baldwin toured in support of the book, speaking about his experiences related in it.[93][94][95][96]
By August 2011,[97] Baldwin began dating Hilaria Thomas, a yoga instructor with Yoga Vida in Manhattan.[98][99] Baldwin and Thomas moved from the Upper West Side to Greenwich Village that August.[100][101][102] The couple became engaged in April 2012[98] and married on June 30, 2012, at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral in New York City.[103] They have four children together, daughter Carmen (born August 23, 2013),[104] and sons Rafael (born June 17, 2015),[105] Leonardo Angel Charles (born September 2016)[106] and Romeo Alejandro David (born May 2018).[107] In April 2019, Thomas announced that she was pregnant with the couple's fifth child;[108] later that month she confirmed a miscarriage, saying she wanted to be part of normalizing and removing the stigma of miscarriage.[109] In September 2019, the couple announced that Hilaria was again pregnant,[110] but in November 2019, the couple announced that Hilaria had suffered a second miscarriage.[111]
In October 1995, Baldwin allegedly assaulted a photographer for videotaping his wife, Kim Basinger, and their 3-day-old daughter. The couple was returning from the hospital and was confronted by the photographer outside their Los Angeles home. Whoopi Goldberg praised Baldwin for his actions during her opening monologue while hosting the 68th Academy Awards.[112][113]
In December 2011, Baldwin was on an American Airlines flight at Los Angeles International Airport, playing Words with Friends on his phone while waiting for takeoff. When instructed to put away the "electronic device" by the flight attendant, he reportedly became belligerent and was eventually removed from the plane. He later publicly apologized to the passengers who were delayed.[114]
A 2012 commercial for Capital One credit cards, for which Baldwin was a spokesperson, made a humorous reference to the event: a Viking character from the ad series asks about the phone Baldwin is using, to which Baldwin facetiously replies that it is not to be used on the runway, ending with a chiding "No!"[115] A 2012 Super Bowl commercial for Best Buy also humorously referenced the event. In the commercial, Words With Friends co-creators Paul Bettner and David Bettner are on a plane, and are interrupted by a flight attendant who loudly clears her throat to indicate to them to put their phones away.[116][117]
Baldwin also spoofed the incident during a cameo appearance on Saturday Night Live's "Weekend Update" segment, in which he played himself impersonating the captain of the plane from which he was removed, who publicly "apologized" to Baldwin for the incident.[118][119]
On April 8, 2012, a 40-year-old Canadian actress, Genevieve Sabourin, was arrested outside Baldwin and his wife's Greenwich Village apartment house and charged with aggravated harassment and stalking. She was released without bail and told not to contact Baldwin. Prosecutors said she and Baldwin had met on a film set more than ten years earlier, and that, beginning in 2011, she began sending him multiple unwanted emails and texts.[120]
In 2013, Manhattan prosecutors filed nearly two dozen harassment and stalking charges against her, saying she had continued her unwanted advances. On April 8, she rejected a plea bargain, and a trial date was set for May 13.[121] On November 8, at the end of a non-jury trial, Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Robert Mandelbaum found Sabourin, by then 41, guilty on all counts and sentenced her to 180 days in jail for stalking, attempted aggravated harassment, and harassment, plus 30 days for attempted contempt of court.[122][123] Sabourin was released from New York City's Rikers Island jail on March 28, 2014.[124]
In 2014, Baldwin was arrested for disorderly conduct after riding his bike the wrong way down a one-way street.[125][126][127]
On November 26, 2018, Baldwin appeared in a New York court to face a misdemeanor charge of third-degree attempted assault and second-degree harassment violation after a parking dispute in Manhattan's West Village on November 2.[128][129][130]
The prosecutor said Baldwin told the responding officer, "He's an ass. He stole my spot. I did push him."[131] On January 23, 2019, Baldwin pleaded guilty to harassment and agreed to attend a one-day anger management class.[132]
Baldwin is a Democrat and endorsed Barack Obama in his two presidential campaigns.[133][134] He serves on the board of People for the American Way. He is an animal rights activist and a strong supporter of PETA,[135][136] for which he has done work that includes narrating the video entitled Meet Your Meat.[137] Baldwin lent his support to the Save the Manatee Club by donating his time to record several public service announcements for the group, which had contacted him following his role in "The Bonfire of the Manatees", an episode of The Simpsons in which he was the voice of a biologist working to save the endangered mammals.[138] Baldwin also gave his support for Farm Sanctuary's Adopt A Turkey Project and stated, "At least 46 million turkeys suffer heartbreaking fear and pain before being killed each and every Thanksgiving..."[139]
During his appearance on the comedy late night show Late Night with Conan O'Brien on December 11, 1998, eight days before President Bill Clinton was to be impeached, Baldwin said, "If we were in another country ... we would stone Henry Hyde to death and we would go to their homes and kill their wives and their children. We would kill their families, for what they're doing to this country."[140] Baldwin later apologized for the remarks, and the network explained that it was meant as a joke and promised not to re-run it.[141]
Baldwin said in a 2006 interview with The New York Times that if he did become involved in electoral politics, he would prefer to run for Governor of New York. When asked if he was qualified for the office, Baldwin responded that he considered himself more qualified than California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.[142] On December 21, 2011, Baldwin, addressing speculation, said he was abandoning plans to run for mayor of New York City and would instead continue in his role on 30 Rock.[143] That April, he suggested he might change his mind, saying, "Let's see what things are like in 2014. I would love to do it."[144][145]
In February 2009, Baldwin spoke out to encourage state leaders to renew New York's tax break for the film and television industry, stating that if the "tax breaks are not reinstated into the budget, film production in this town is going to collapse and television production is going to collapse and it's all going to go to California".[146]
During the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, Baldwin was slated to appear in a taped skit. However, the producers of the show cut a portion of the skit containing a reference to Rupert Murdoch and the News International phone hacking scandal. Baldwin subsequently boycotted the Emmy Awards and requested that his entire appearance be removed from the broadcast. Producers complied and he was replaced with Leonard Nimoy.[147]
Despite demonstrating strong political beliefs throughout his career, in October 2013, Baldwin announced that he would not donate money to political candidates while hosting his talk show Up Late with Alec Baldwin on MSNBC, in accordance with the company's policy.[148]
