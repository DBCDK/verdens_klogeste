Brown rose to prominence in the 1990s as a member of the girl group Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Scary Spice.

During the group's hiatus, Brown released her debut solo album Hot. The album's lead single, "I Want You Back" charted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, and was included on the soundtrack for the 1998 film Why Do Fools Fall in Love. Other singles from the album such as "Tell Me" and "Feels So Good" both charted within the top 5 in the UK. After signing with the independent label Amber Café, she released her second solo album L.A. State of Mind, which spawned the release of one single "Today".

Melanie Janine Brown was born in Hyde Park, Leeds,[4] and grew up in the Kirkstall area of the city, the daughter of Andrea (née Dixon) and Martin Brown.[5] Her father is from the Caribbean island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis; her mother is British. Through her mother, Brown is a first cousin of actor and director Christian Cooke. Cooke's mother, Di, and Brown's mother, Andrea, are sisters.[4][6] Brown studied performing arts at Intake High School in Leeds before entering the entertainment industry.[7] For a time, she worked as a dancer in Blackpool, Lancashire.[7] After seeing an advertisement for an audition in a newspaper, Brown started her music career in a band known as Touch. The group left the original management team and eventually teamed up with music manager Simon Fuller.
In 1994, Brown, along with Mel C, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria Beckham responded to an advertisement in The Stage magazine.[8] Around 400 women who answered the advertisement attended auditions at Danceworks Studios in Mayfair, London. Halliwell, Chisholm, Beckham and Brown were originally chosen as the members of the group, and then formed a quintet with Emma Bunton. The group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and were frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was going and broke with them. In 1995, they toured record labels in London and Los Angeles and finally signed a deal with Virgin Records. Their debut album, Spice, was a huge worldwide commercial success, peaked at number one in more than 17 countries,[9] and was certified multi-platinum in 27 countries.[9] The album centred on the idea of Girl Power, and was compared to Beatlemania.[10] In total the album sold 30 million copies worldwide[11][12] and became the biggest-selling album in music history by a girl group and one of the most successful albums of all time.[13][14] The first single, "Wannabe", reached number one in 37 countries and all the following singles – "Say You'll Be There", "2 Become 1", "Who Do You Think You Are" and "Mama" – also peaked at number one in United Kingdom.[15][16]
In 1997, they released their second album, Spiceworld, and their first two singles "Spice Up Your Life" and "Too Much", entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, making seven consecutive number one hit singles, an all-time record for a musical group.[17] The album was a global best seller, selling 20 million copies worldwide.[18] The group also starred in their own film, Spiceworld: The Movie, which grossed $100 million worldwide and became the second most watched movie of the year. The next single, "Stop", peaked at two, breaking the sequence of number ones. "Viva Forever", another number one, was the last single before Geri Halliwell's departure from the group in May 1998.[19] As a four-piece, the group released "Goodbye" in late 1998. It topped the UK Singles Chart and became their third consecutive Christmas number-one – equaling the record previously set by The Beatles.[20] Before the split of the Spice Girls, Brown went on to release music with Virgin Records, the label she was signed to when a member of the Spice Girls. "I Want You Back" charted at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and also had success around the globe. The song was recorded for the soundtrack of the film Why Do Fools Fall in Love. The single sold 218,000 copies and became the 82nd Bestselling British Single of the year.[21] 
Due to its futuristic aesthetic in green and black, the video of "I Want You Back" becomes cult, marks the spirits and is considered one of the most beautiful music video of the last three decades.[22][23]
In 1999, while recording her album, Brown worked with producers such as Sisqó, Teddy Riley, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson, Prince), with whom she was also working on the Spice Girls' third album, Forever.[24] At the suggestion of her then-husband Jimmy Gulzar, Brown covered Cameo's 1986 hit "Word Up" as her next solo release.[24] The track was already released on the soundtrack to Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. The song charted poorly, peaking at fourteen on the UK Singles Chart making it the lowest-charting Spice Girls-related single of the 90s.[25] Turning to television work, she hosted Pure Naughty, a weekly BBC2 magazine show focusing on black music.[24] She also hosted the MOBO Awards on two occasions, in 1998 with Bill Bellamy and in 1999 with Wyclef Jean, and took part in a BBC-funded short film entitled Fish.[24] She hosted a number of TV shows such as This Is My Moment (a talent show) for ITV1 and shot a documentary called Voodoo Princess for Channel 4.[26] She took part in smaller projects as a presenter such as Top of the Pops, Party in the Park for The Prince's Trust and The All Star Animal Awards. She has appeared as herself in an advert for the Yorkshire tourist board in a series which included contributions from other Yorkshire-born celebrities, and in the film Happy Birthday Oscar Wilde.
Brown's debut album, Hot was released in November 2000, a month before the final Spice Girls album, Forever was released. Following the release of Forever, which was far less successful than their previous two albums, the Spice Girls stopped recording and the members began investing more time into their solo careers. The lead single from the Hot, "Tell Me", debuted at No. 4 in the UK charts with about 40,000 copies sold in its first week of release.[24] It sold approximately 100,000 copies, making it the 158th "best seller" of 2000.[27] Further singles were released in February 2001; "Feels So Good" which had peaked at No. 5, followed by a "Lullaby", a pop number dedicated to her daughter.[24] It was accompanied by a video shot in Morocco and featured Brown with Phoenix Chi. The media criticised Brown for using her child in the music video and single artwork, labeling her Desperate Spice and insinuating that she was exploiting her child as a marketing tool.[24] The single entered and peaked at No. 13. The album was not a success and garnered mediocre reviews,[28] selling a disappointing 7,419 copies in its first week and charting at a weak No. 28 leading to Virgin dumping Brown from their label.[29] In 2002, Brown released her autobiography, Catch a Fire, which reached No. 7 in the official books chart,[7] and saw her touring the UK to promote it with a run of book signings. In 2003 Brown's first movie role came in the form of a British drama, Burn It.[7] She appeared in a horror film entitled, LD 50 Lethal Dose, which was released directly to DVD in 2005.[30] She acted in a long run of shows as part of the cast for The Vagina Monologues.

"Today" entered the singles chart at No. 41, selling around 1,000 copies in its first week.[32] The album, LA State of Mind, was released on 27 June 2005 in two formats: as a regular CD and as a limited edition with a 30-minute DVD documentary detailing Brown's life in Los Angeles.[32] In a scathing review, AllMusic stated that this album was one of the worst pop albums of the decade.[33] The album was also released with a bonus DVD featuring an in-depth documentary filmed and directed by Mark McConnell.[34] Brown said she did not sign with a major label because the album was a non-commercial project.[35] She also shied away from recording in an R&B or hip hop style again, instead focusing on using adult themes and rhythms such as in acoustic music[36] following an appearance in the film Love Thy Neighbor.
In September 2007, Brown joined the fifth season of the US television dance competition, Dancing with the Stars with her partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy.
