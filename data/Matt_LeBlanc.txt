Matthew Steven LeBlanc (/ləˈblɒŋk/; born July 25, 1967) is an American actor and comedian.[2] He is best known for his portrayal of dim-witted yet well-intentioned womaniser Joey Tribbiani in the NBC sitcom Friends and in its spin-off series Joey. For his work on Friends, LeBlanc received three Emmy Award nominations. He has also starred as a fictionalized version of himself in Episodes (2011–2017), for which he won a Golden Globe Award and received four additional Emmy Award nominations. He co-hosted Top Gear from 2016 to 2019. As of 2019[update], he plays Adam Burns in Man with a Plan.
LeBlanc was born in Newton, Massachusetts. His mother, Patricia (née Di Cillo), was an office manager; his father, Paul LeBlanc, was a mechanic.[2][3][4] His father is of French-Canadian descent and his mother is of Italian ancestry.[5] He attended Newton North High School, and graduated in 1985, alongside comedian Louis C.K.[6][7] He moved to New York at the age of 17 to pursue a career in modelling.[7]
LeBlanc first appeared in a 1987 Heinz Tomato Ketchup commercial. In 1988, he starred in the television drama TV 101 for one season. In 1991, he had a recurring role on the hit Fox sitcom Married... with Children. He played Vinnie Verducci, the son of one the protagonist's friends and boyfriend to his daughter. He went on to star in two short-lived spin-offs: Top of the Heap (1991) and Vinnie and Bobby (1992).
He appeared in two Jon Bon Jovi music videos: "Miracle", from the Young Guns II soundtrack in 1990, and "Say It Isn't So" in 2000.[8] He also appeared in Alanis Morissette's single "Walk Away", Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Into the Great Wide Open", and in Bob Seger's "Night Moves".[9]
LeBlanc found success in the role of Joey Tribbiani on Friends, and went on to play this character for 12 years — 10 seasons of Friends and two seasons of Joey. Friends was wildly successful, and LeBlanc, along with his co-stars, gained wide recognition among viewers. This ensemble situation comedy became a major hit for NBC, airing on Thursday nights for ten years.[10]
For his performance, LeBlanc received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, three Golden Globe award nominations, and one Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. During this time he also appeared in the films Lookin' Italian (1994), Ed (1996), Lost in Space (1998), Charlie's Angels (2000), and its sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003).
Following the cancellation of Joey, LeBlanc announced that he would be taking a one-year hiatus from acting on TV, which eventually turned into five years. His next role was a fictionalized version of himself on Episodes.[11]
From 2011, LeBlanc began appearing as a fictional version of himself in Episodes, a television series about a fictional American remake of an equally fictional British television series.[12][13] The series is written by Friends co-creator David Crane and his partner Jeffrey Klarik.[14] At the 69th Golden Globe Awards in 2012, LeBlanc won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a television series, musical, or comedy, and was nominated for an additional four Primetime Emmy Awards.[15]
In February 2012, LeBlanc appeared in the second episode of the eighteenth series of Top Gear, where he set the fastest lap time in the "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" segment in a Kia Cee'd. Lapping at 1:42.1, he beat the show's previous recordholder Rowan Atkinson by 0.1 seconds.[9] He also appeared in the fourth episode of the nineteenth season to race the New Kia Cee'd, and beat his previous time.
In February 2016, the BBC announced LeBlanc had signed on to become one of the new Top Gear hosts,[16] signing a new two-year deal later that year.[17] He announced his decision to retire from the series in May 2018, having co-hosted it for three years. Despite the show being "great fun", he stated the "time commitment and extensive travel takes me away from my family and friends more than I'm comfortable with."[18]
LeBlanc plays the lead role in the CBS sitcom Man with a Plan, which began airing in 2016.[19]
LeBlanc married Melissa McKnight, a British-born American model, in May 2003.[20] They had been introduced in 1997 by McKnight's friend, wife of actor Lou Diamond Phillips. LeBlanc proposed to her a year later.[20] Their daughter, born in 2004, began suffering seizures at eight months old. By the time she was two years old, the condition, thought to be a form of dysplasia, had mostly subsided.[20][21] LeBlanc and McKnight divorced in October 2006, citing irreconcilable differences.[22]
