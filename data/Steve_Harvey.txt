In the late '80s, Harvey was homeless for three years.[10] He slept in his 1976 Ford when not performing gigs that provided a hotel, and he showered at gas stations or swimming pool showers.[11] Rich and Becky Liss helped Harvey during this time with a contract for carpet cleaning and credit at a travel agency.[12]
Harvey was a finalist in the Second Annual Johnnie Walker National Comedy Search performing on April 16, 1990, eventually leading to a long stint as host of It's Showtime at the Apollo, succeeding Mark Curry in that role.

In 1997, Harvey continued his work in stand-up comedy, performing on the Kings of Comedy tour along with Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley, and Bernie Mac. The tour became the highest grossing comedy tour in history, grossing $18 million its first year and $19 million its second.[15] The comedy act would later be put together into a film by Spike Lee called The Original Kings of Comedy.[16] That title was also used as the name of his comedy and variety television show (later renamed Steve Harvey's Big Time Challenge), which aired on The WB network from 2003 until 2005.[17]
Harvey is the host of The Steve Harvey Morning Show, a weekday morning radio program he has hosted since 2000.[18] It was originally syndicated through Radio One Inc. from September 2000 until May 2005.[citation needed] As of 2019, the show is syndicated through the United States.[18]

On August 2, 2012, Harvey performed his final stand-up act at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, ending a 27-year career as a stand-up comedian. The two-hour performance was broadcast live on Pay-Per-View. “The road to this final show has been an amazing journey, doing stand-up for the past 27 years, and I can’t thank fans enough after reflecting on all those years on stage,” he said.[32][33] The same year, Harvey debuted a self-titled syndicated talk show produced by Endemol and distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution at the NBC Tower in Chicago.[34]
In 2013, Harvey became the first double host nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award, receiving nominations for both Outstanding Talk Show Host and Outstanding Game Show Host.[35] He was also honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[36] The following year, Harvey launched a new dating website called Delightful.

In December 2015, Harvey hosted the Miss Universe 2015 pageant in Las Vegas. Upon announcing the final results, he mistakenly named the first runner-up, Miss Colombia (Ariadna Gutiérrez) as the winner. A few minutes after she was crowned, Harvey announced that he had read the results incorrectly and that Miss Philippines (Pia Wurtzbach) was the new Miss Universe.[38] He apologized to Wurtzbach outside the venue and later tweeted an apology to both contestants.[39][40][41] Harvey also hosted the Miss Universe 2016 pageant in the Philippines on January 30, 2017, telling the Miss Universe Organization that he wanted to personally apologize to the Filipinos for the incident that occurred in the last Miss Universe pageant he hosted.[42] He returned as host for the Miss Universe 2017 pageant in Las Vegas on November 26, 2017 and the Miss Universe 2018 pageant in Thailand on December 17, 2018.[43]
In January 2016, Harvey gave a motivational speech to audience members after the taping of an episode of Family Feud. He theme of the speech was for people to embrace the skills they were born with.

In October 2016, it was announced that Harvey would host two revival specials of Showtime at the Apollo for Fox.[46] In November 2016, the Steve Harvey talk show was cancelled, and it was announced that Harvey had reached a deal with IMG to produce a new syndicated talk show in Los Angeles with NBCUniversal. The new series, Steve, premiered in September 2017, and was described as having more of a celebrity and comedy oriented format with a larger amount of creative control held by Harvey, as opposed to the previous program's larger focus on human interest subjects. To facilitate the new series, production of Harvey's radio show and Family Feud were relocated to L.A.[47][48]
Harvey is the co-creator of Little Big Shots, a series launched in 2016 and executive produced by him and Ellen DeGeneres.[49] The series features children demonstrating talents and engaging in conversation with Harvey. Harvey hosted the show until 2019.[50]

The company also owns the rights for international versions of Family Feud,[52] of which an African version of the show was announced to begin in 2020.[53] He also launched the Sand and Soul Festival in 2017.

In August 2011, on his radio show, Harvey called Cornel West and Tavis Smiley "Uncle Toms" because of their criticism of President Barack Obama.[73] Harvey later apologized for using the slur but maintained his criticism of West and Smiley.[74][75] In January 2017, Harvey was met with backlash from some in the African-American community for his decision to meet with then-President elect Donald Trump. He defended his decision, citing that it would help spark positive changes.[76]
Harvey has received criticism for a May 30, 2009, book interview he gave on Larry King Live, which was guest-hosted by Joy Behar.[77] During that interview, he asserted that women should not date atheists who, he claimed, have no "moral barometer." He opined that atheists are "idiot[s]" and stated that his usual response to discussions with atheists is to walk away.[78][79]
In January 2017, Steve Harvey made jokes on Steve Harvey about Asian men, ridiculing the idea that any white woman or black woman would want to date them. "Excuse me, do you like Asian men?" he said, "No, thank you." He went on to add, "I don't even like Chinese food."[80] The remarks were met with criticism from Asian Americans, including New York politicians and author Eddie Huang.[81][82] For instance, Huang remarked about Harvey's hypocrisy in speaking about issues facing the black community while denigrating Asians.[82][83] Harvey apologized on his talk show and Twitter, saying: "I offer my humblest apology for offending anyone, particularly those in the Asian community. … It was not my intention, and the humor was not meant with any malice or disrespect whatsoever."[84] However, he also earlier said, "I ain’t been laughing that much over the past few days. They’re kinda beating me up on the internet right now for no reason. But, you know, that’s life, ain’t it?"[85]
In response to a caller from Flint, Michigan, who insulted the Cleveland Cavaliers after their loss to the Golden State Warriors, Harvey, a Cavaliers fan, told the caller to "go have yourself a nice glass of brown water!" in reference to the city's water crisis. The joke was criticized by, among others, Amariyanna Copeny and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, who demanded a public apology. Harvey responded by saying, "The caller and I were talking trash about our teams and cities. Simply trash talking about sports. I made a joke directed at him, as he is from Flint, a city for which I have great affection and respect. So much so that I devoted a full hour on my daytime talk show to raising awareness for the Flint water crisis. … The caller laughed, as my joke was taken in the context it was offered."[86][87]
Harvey is the founder of the Steve & Marjorie Harvey Foundation, a philanthropic organization that provides youth outreach services.[88] The foundation hosts a yearly camp for fatherless children[89] and also partnered with Kent State University to provide scholarships to the school.[90] Harvey is also a partner with Walt Disney World Resort and Essence for the Disney Dreamers Academy, a yearly workshop at Walt Disney World for 100 students.[91]

In June 2007, Harvey married Marjorie Bridges, who he says is responsible for making him a better man and changing his life. Marjorie Harvey is mother to three children (Morgan, Jason, and Lori [96]), all of whom Steve adopted. Steve and Marjorie have five grandchildren: three through Jason's marriage to his wife Amanda, one through Morgan's marriage to her husband Kareem, and one through Karli's marriage to husband Ben.[100] Through 2017, Harvey and his family divided their time between Atlanta, where his radio show was broadcast and Family Feud was recorded, and Chicago, where he hosted his talk show for NBCUniversal from the company's Chicago studios, although he would host his radio show there as well.[101] In 2018, Harvey moved his talk show, radio show, and Family Feud to Los Angeles.[102]
