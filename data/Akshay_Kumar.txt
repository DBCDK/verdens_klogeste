Kumar is one of the most successful Bollywood actors since the 1990s, having starred in 111 films, 52 of which were commercially successful.[4][5][6]. He was the first Bollywood actor whose films' domestic net lifetime collections crossed ₹20 billion (US$280 million) by 2013,[7] and ₹30 billion (US$420 million) by 2016.[8] Having done so, he has established himself as one of the prominent actors of Hindi cinema.[9][10] When he began his acting career in the 1990s, he primarily starred in action films. Later, Kumar also gained fame for his drama, romantic and comic roles.
Apart from acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor; he has often performed many dangerous stunts in his films, which has earned him the sobriquet "Indian Jackie Chan".[11][12] In 2008, he hosted the show Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi. In 2009, he founded the Hari Om Entertainment production company[13] and Grazing Goat Pictures production company in 2012. In 2014, Kumar launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance.

Kumar was born in Amritsar, Punjab, India,[3] to Hari Om Bhatia and Aruna Bhatia in a Punjabi family.[16][17] His father was an army officer.[18] From a young age, Kumar was very interested in sports. His father too enjoyed wrestling. He lived and grew up in Delhi's Chandni Chowk and later he moved to Mumbai when his father left Army to become an accountant with UNICEF.[19] Soon, his sister was born and the family lived in Koliwada, a Punjabi dominated area of Central Mumbai.[16] He received his school education from Don Bosco School, simultaneously learning Karate.  He enrolled in Mumbai's Guru Nanak Khalsa College for higher education, but dropped out as he was not much interested in studies. He requested his father that he wanted to learn martial arts further, and his father somehow saved money to send him to Thailand. Kumar went to Bangkok to learn martial arts and lived in Thailand for five years learning Thai Boxing.[16][20] Kumar also has a sister, Alka Bhatia.[21] When Kumar was a teenager, his father asked him what he aspired to be. Kumar expressed his desire to become an actor.[22]
After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India,[23] he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter.[24] After Thailand, Kumar went to work in Kolkata in a travel agency, in Dhaka in a hotel and Delhi where he sold Kundan jewellery. Upon his return to Mumbai, he commenced the teaching of martial arts.[19]
During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio.[25][26] He also worked as a background dancer in various films.[27] One morning, he missed his flight for an ad-shoot in Bangalore. Disappointed with himself, he visited a film studio along with his portfolio. That evening, Kumar was signed for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie Deedar.[28][29][30]
Kumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in Saugandh (1991). In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed Dancer, which received poor reviews.[31] The following year he starred in Abbas Mustan-directed suspense thriller, Khiladi, widely considered his breakthrough role.[32][33][34] His next release was the Raj Sippy-directed detective film Mr. Bond, based on James Bond.[35] His last release of 1992 was Deedar. It failed to perform well at the box office.[36] In 1993, he acted in the Keshu Ramsay-directed bilingual film  Ashaant (released in Kannada as Vishnu-Vijaya) and starring Dr. Vishnuvardhan, Ashwini Bhave and Ashutosh Rana. All of his films released during 1993, including Dil Ki Baazi, Kayda Kanoon, Waqt Hamara Hai and Sainik did not perform well commercially.[37] In 1994, he played a police inspector in two films: Sameer Malkan-directed remake of Hollywood film The Hard Way, Main Khiladi Tu Anari and Rajiv Rai-directed Mohra which were among the highest-grossing films of the year.[38] Later that year, he starred in Yash Chopra-produced romance, Yeh Dillagi opposite Kajol. His role in the film earned Kumar his first nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare Awards[39] and Star Screen award.[37] During the same year, Kumar also had success with films like Suhaag and the low budget action film Elaan. All these achievements, promoted Kumar as one of the most successful actors of the year.[40] In 1994, he appeared in 11 feature films.[41]
The following year, Kumar played dual role in Umesh Mehra-directed action thriller, Sabse Bada Khiladi, which was a commercial success.[42] He proved to have success with the Khiladi series, as in the next year he starred in the fourth film of the Khiladi series, Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi opposite Rekha and Raveena Tandon. The film was a commercial success.[43] During the film's shooting Kumar was injured. He received treatment in United States.[44]
Kumar played a supporting role in Yash Chopra-directed romance, Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor, for which he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award.[45] In the same year, he starred opposite Juhi Chawla in David Dhawan-directed comedy Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi, fifth instalment of the Khiladi series. Unlike his previous films of the series, it failed commercially.[46] His following releases failed commercial and this caused a setback to his film career.[47] In 1999, Kumar played opposite Twinkle Khanna in International Khiladi. The film turned out to be an average grosser at the box office.[34] He received critical acclaim for his roles in the films Sangharsh and Jaanwar.

In 2000, Kumar starred in the Priyadarshan-directed comedy Hera Pheri alongside Paresh Rawal and Sunil Shetty. The film which was a remake of Malayalam film Ramji Rao Speaking,[51] became a commercial success[52] and proved to be a turning point in Kumar's career.[53] He also starred in the Dharmesh Darshan-directed romantic drama Dhadkan later that same year. The film performed moderately at the box office[52] but Kumar was praised for his acting.

In a later scene, he is also seen being chased by a car, dodging bullets, jumping off buildings, and climbing walls.[55] His character in the film had two names and his role received mixed reviews. In his review, Taran Adarsh wrote that "The actor does a great job in a role that has negative shades, but as a softie in the second half, he is just about okay. And that's mainly because he has been asked to do what he has been doing in film after film. Nevertheless, Khiladi 420 is amongst his finest performances."[56] Sukanya Verma wrote "Negative roles and Akshay Kumar don't go hand-in-hand. [...] Akshay is ridiculously over the top and irritating to the core. However, he manages a decent performance as the sober and suave Anand."[57] His first release in 2001 was Suneel Darshan-directed drama Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love. Kumar was praised for his performance in the film.[58] Next, he played a negative role in the Abbas Mustan-directed film Ajnabee.[59][60] While reviewing the film for Rediff.com, Sarita Tanwar termed Kumar the "surprise package" of the film.

While reviewing the film, Taran Adarsh wrote "Akshay Kumar is plain mediocre. The role hardly offers him scope to try out anything different."[71] Next, he starred in Raj Kanwar-directed romantic drama Andaaz alongside Priyanka Chopra and Lara Dutta. The film received mixed reviews from critics,[72][73] but turned out to be a commercial success at the box office and the first universal hit of 2003.[74][75]

He said that the promos and posters reminded him of his own The Godfather.

I was so humbled, not only as an actor but as a fan of his legendary work."[158][159] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN criticised Kumar for his "in-your-face flamboyance".[160] After the film's mainly negative reviews, Kumar lashed out at critics, accusing them of lacking an understanding of the audience and the basic ideas of filmmaking.[161] Built on an approximate budget of ₹1 billion (US$14 million),[162] it was the first major Hindi language film to be shot in Oman.[163] Kumar received a nomination for Best Actor in a Negative Role at Zee Cine Awards.[164]

In December 2019, Kumar revealed that he has applied for an Indian passport and plans to give up his Canadian citizenship.[2] He stated, "I have now applied for the passport. I am an Indian and it hurts me that I am asked to prove that every time. My wife, my children are Indian. I pay my taxes here and my life is here." Further revealing his reason for earlier changing his nationality as a Canadian,  he said," There was a time when I had 14 flops in a row and I was wondering what to do. One of my closest friends who stays in Canada told me come here and we will work together’. I started the process to get a Canadian passport because I felt my career was finished and I won’t get more work here. But my 15th film worked and I never looked back. I never thought of changing my passport."[2][1]
