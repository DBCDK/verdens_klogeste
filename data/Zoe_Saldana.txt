Zoë Yadira Saldaña Nazario (born June 19, 1978) is an American actress. Following her performances with the theater group Faces, Saldana made her screen debut in a 1999 episode of Law & Order. Her film career began a year later with Center Stage (2000), where she played a struggling ballet dancer. She had played the role of Neytiri, the female lead and one of the main protagonists of James Cameron's sci-fi film Avatar.
Saldana became known for her work in science fiction films, beginning in 2009 with her first of multiple appearances as Nyota Uhura in the Star Trek film series and her first appearance as Neytiri in the Avatar film series. She has also played Gamora in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Guardians of the Galaxy (2014).[1] Due to her appearances in some of the highest-grossing films of all time, such as Avatar and Avengers: Endgame, Saldana is the second highest-grossing film actress of all time, as of 2019[update].[2] Her films have collectively grossed more than $11 billion worldwide.[3]
Saldana was born June 19, 1978 in Passaic, New Jersey.[4][5][6] Her father, Aridio Saldaña,[7] was Dominican, while her mother, Asalia Nazario, is Puerto Rican.[8]  She was christened Zoë Yadira Saldaña Nazario, reflecting both of her parents' surnames.[9][10]  With regard to her racial identity, Saldana stated, "There's no one way to be black. I'm black the way I know how to be."[11] She spent the majority of her early childhood growing up in Jackson Heights, New York. She was raised bilingual, speaking English and Spanish. She has two sisters, Cisely and Mariel.[12] Their father died in a car crash when Zoe was 9 years old, and their mother subsequently moved with the children to the Dominican Republic.[12]
Saldana discovered her love of dance in the Dominican Republic and enrolled in the ECOS Espacio de Danza Academy; she studied various forms of dance,[5][12][13][14] but describes ballet as her first passion.[12][15] She told Vanity Fair that she quit ballet because she did not "have the feet" and had too much pride and ambition to just be in the corps de ballet.[15] The family returned to New York after her sophomore year in high school.[15] In 1995, she began performing with the Faces theater group in Brooklyn,[16] which put on plays geared toward providing positive messages for teens via themes dealing with issues such as substance abuse and adolescent sexuality. Concurrently, she performed with the New York Youth Theater; her appearance in their production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat led a talent agency to recruit her. Her previous dance training, and her acting experience, helped her land her first film role, playing talented and headstrong ballet student Eva Rodriguez in Center Stage (2000).[5][13]
Saldana was still a member of Faces when she gained exposure in an episode of Law & Order (titled "Refuge, Part 2") which first aired in 1999.[17] Saldana's first film role was in Center Stage (2000), directed by Nicholas Hytner, about a group of young dancers from various backgrounds who enroll at the fictitious American Ballet Academy in New York City. She then appeared in the Britney Spears vehicle Crossroads (2002). The film was met with negative reviews from critics, but became somewhat of a box office success.[18][19] The same year, Saldana starred in the comedy-drama Drumline (2002), alongside Nick Cannon, which was met with generally favorable reviews.[20][21]
In Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), she played Anamaria, a female pirate who signs up to join Will Turner and Mr. Gibbs for a chance to confront Jack Sparrow for stealing her ship. She then appeared in The Terminal as Dolores Torres, an immigration officer and Star Trek fan, a role that would later help Saldana when she came to appear in the Star Trek reboot (2009).[22] In 2004, she also made appearances in Haven and Temptation, both of which had little to no box office success.
In 2005, Saldana appeared in Constellation, Guess Who with Ashton Kutcher, and Dirty Deeds. She then starred in the romantic comedy-dramas Premium (2006) and After Sex (2007).[23] The same year, Saldana starred in Blackout, a television film set in New York City during the Northeast Blackout of 2003. The film premiered at the 2007 Zurich Film Festival[24] and debuted on BET in 2008.[25] Saldana also had a small role as Angie Jones in the action thriller Vantage Point (2008).[26]
Saldana appeared in two roles in 2009, which both went on to raise her profile considerably.[13] She played Nyota Uhura in Star Trek.[27] The film's director J. J. Abrams asked Saldana to play the role because he had seen and liked her previous work. Saldana had never seen the original series, though she had played a Trekkie in The Terminal (2004), but agreed to play the role after Abrams complimented her. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background and named the character.[28] Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voicemails during filming, giving advice on the role.[29] Steven Spielberg taught her the Vulcan salute five years earlier when he directed her in The Terminal.[22] Star Trek (2009) was a box office success grossing $385.7 million.[30]
Saldana's second high-profile film in 2009 was James Cameron's Avatar, in which she played the indigenous hunter Neytiri. Avatar was well-received by critics, accumulating an approval rating of 83% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.[31] It grossed $2.7 billion worldwide to become the highest-grossing film of all time,[32] as well as in the United States and Canada. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide.[33] The film was nominated for ten Saturn Awards and won all ten at the 36th Saturn Awards ceremony.
