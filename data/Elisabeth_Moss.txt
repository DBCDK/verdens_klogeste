Elisabeth Moss was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Ron and Linda Moss, both of whom were musicians.[3] Moss has one younger brother.[4] She was raised a Scientologist.[5] Her father is English.[6] Her mother is of part Swedish descent.[7]
Initially, Moss had aspirations of becoming a professional dancer.[4] In her adolescence, she traveled to New York City to study ballet at the School of American Ballet, after which she studied with Suzanne Farrell at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.[3] Moss continued to study dance throughout her teenage years, but began obtaining acting roles as well. In order to manage her education and career, she began homeschooling, and graduated in 1999 at age sixteen.[3]
Moss's first screen role was in 1990, when she appeared in the NBC miniseries Lucky/Chances.[8] From 1992 until 1995, Moss appeared as Cynthia Parks in seven episodes of the TV series Picket Fences.[8] She provided the voice of Holly DeCarlo, a main character in the TV special Frosty Returns (1992) and of Michelle in the animated film Once Upon a Forest (1993). She appeared in the television remake of the 1993 film Gypsy and played Harvey Keitel's younger daughter in the film Imaginary Crimes (1994). The following year, she appeared in the remake of the Walt Disney Pictures film Escape to Witch Mountain (1995) and played a young Ashley Judd in the TV-movie biopic Love Can Build A Bridge (1995).[8] She also had a supporting role in the drama Separate Lives (1995) opposite Jim Belushi and Linda Hamilton, and a minor part in the black comedy The Last Supper (1995).[9] Moss also again provided voice work, for the animated series Freakazoid! and the television film It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown!

It required Zoey to be a bit of a pain with her fancy French boyfriend, but Moss always made her relatable, even when the plot required otherwise."[10]
In 1999, she had a supporting role as a patient in a mental institution in James Mangold's Girl, Interrupted, opposite Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie,[8] and a minor part in the drama Anywhere But Here.

In 2002, Moss appeared in a commercial for Excedrin in which she directly addressed the audience about the medication’s benefits for people who suffer from migraines. The spot proved enduringly popular and ran for several years, providing Moss with residual income as she struggled to make it as an actress.[11]
Moss went on to appear in Heart of America and three other films in 2004. That year, she also made the movie Virgin,[8] for which she was nominated for a 2004 Independent Spirit Award. Moss also had a supporting part in Ron Howard's Western thriller The Missing (2003).[12]

In September 2014 it was announced that Moss would star on Broadway as Heidi Holland in The Heidi Chronicles.[24] The play opened on March 19, 2015 at The Music Box Theatre.[25] Though the play received some positive reviews,[25] it closed on May 3, 2015 due to low ticket sales.[26] Moss was nominated for a Tony Award for her role, losing to Helen Mirren in The Audience.[27] After production on Mad Men had wrapped, Moss collaborated again with Alex Ross Perry, starring in Queen of Earth (2015), a psychological thriller opposite Katherine Waterston and Patrick Fugit, in which she plays a mentally unstable woman who unravels at a vacation home in the company of her close friends.

Moss practices Scientology[52] and identifies as a feminist.[53] After a fan questioned whether her role in the Hulu series The Handmaid's Tale made her think about her involvement with the Church of Scientology, Moss defended her beliefs on Instagram, writing that the idea that Gilead in the series and Scientology "both believe that all outside sources are wrong or evil," as the fan had described, is "actually not true at all". She continued, "Religious freedom and tolerance and understanding the truth and equal rights for every race, religion and creed are extremely important to me."[54]
