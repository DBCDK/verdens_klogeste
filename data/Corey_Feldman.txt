The Lost Boys marked the first onscreen pairing of Feldman and Haim, who became known as "The Two Coreys".[9][10] The pair went on to star in a string of films, including License to Drive (1988) and Dream a Little Dream (1989).[11][12] Feldman also voiced the character of Donatello in the original live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.[13]
After a public battle with drugs[14] (which began shortly after filming concluded for The 'Burbs (1989)),[15] Feldman fought to re-establish his life and career by working with youths, starring in several lesser-known films, and branching out with an album entitled Love Left. He returned to the big screen with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III where he again did the voice of Donatello, and starred in the Richard Donner/Robert Zemeckis/Joel Silver film Tales From The Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood, opposite Dennis Miller and Angie Everhart.[16]
He continued working with his friend Corey Haim on independent films, including a sequel to their last mainstream film together, Dream a Little Dream 2. In 1996, Feldman directed his first and only motion picture, a slapstick comedy called Busted where Haim played a leading role. This was the last film that they did as the Two Coreys.

In September 2016, Feldman made an appearance on the Today show to support his album Angelic 2 the Core,[40] which sparked backlash for its unusual nature.[41] Also in 2016, Feldman stated that he had created a "360 management development and production entity" known as Corey's Angels "to help girls who were kind of lost and needed help to find their way."[42]
Feldman was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Young Entertainer Awards in April 2018.[43]
Feldman contends that sex abuse of child actors is a widespread problem in show business.[44] On October 25, 2017, in response to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Feldman started an Indiegogo campaign to finance a film about his life to expose the secret child sexual abuse that he claims is just as common in Hollywood as sexism and sexual assault against adults.[45][46] In March 2018, Feldman spoke at the New York State Capitol in Albany, New York, in support of the Child Victims Act, which would lengthen the statute of limitations for civil claims arising out of acts of child sex abuse and would create a one-year period in which sex abuse survivors could bring civil claims that are currently barred by the statute of limitations.[47][48][49]
Feldman is a Democrat and an advocate for animal welfare and animal rights; he has adhered to a vegetarian diet since his youth. He appeared with his wife in a PETA ad campaign promoting vegetarianism.[50] He was awarded the Paws of Fame Award by the Wildlife WayStation for his dedication to animal rights.[51][52]
Feldman stated that he began the "Emancipation Proclamation in Hollywood" at age 15, when he was granted emancipation from his parents. He stated that he was worth $1 million by age 15, and by the time the judge ordered the bank records to come forward, only $40,000 remained.[53][54]
Feldman has spoken publicly about his struggles with drug addiction.[55]
On March 28, 2018, Feldman received a small puncture wound from a man in a car and was briefly hospitalized.[56][57][58]
Feldman was close friends with Michael Jackson as a child and teenager. He later expressed frustration toward Jackson, claiming that he had done "real damage" to his childhood by befriending and then abandoning him. Feldman admitted that Jackson helped many children by becoming a friend and mentor, but that he did more harm than good by abandoning children when he grew bored with them.[59]
In February 2005, Feldman was subpoenaed to testify against Jackson in the singer's child molestation trial (although he ultimately did not testify[60]). Feldman said, "I started looking at each piece of information, and with that came this sickening realization that there have been many occurrences in my life and in my relationship to Michael that have created a question of doubt."[61] He added: "So I'm here to say I hope and I pray that these things never happened, and if they never happened, then there's some real sickness with a lot of people. But if they did happen, then there's a lot of sickness with one person. And that person needs to be punished." Although he was adamant that Jackson never touched him, Feldman recounted that when he was 13 or 14 years old, Jackson once showed him a book that was "focused on venereal diseases and the genitalia"; as an adult, Feldman saw this behaviour as inappropriate.[62]
When Jackson died in 2009, Feldman dedicated a Los Angeles hospital concert with his rock band, Truth Movement, to the singer.[63]
In 2013, Feldman spoke out in defense of Jackson in the wake of Wade Robson's sexual molestation accusations.[64] He explicitly denied that Michael Jackson had molested children.[65] In his 2013 autobiography, Feldman claimed that his friendship with Jackson brought him back to normalcy and insisted that Jackson never once acted inappropriately toward him.[66] After new accusations against Jackson were raised in 2019, Feldman repeated that Jackson had never acted inappropriately towards him and called the documentary "one-sided".[67] Two days later, however, he changed his stance, saying he could "no longer defend" Jackson; Feldman added: "It comes to a point where as an advocate for victims¬†... it becomes impossible for me to remain virtuous and not at least consider what's being said".[68]
Feldman was married to actress Vanessa Marcil from 1989 until 1993.[69]
He met actress and model Susie Sprague in a nightclub in January 2002; they married on October 30 that year on the final episode of the first season of The Surreal Life. The ceremony was co-officiated by a rabbi and by M.C. Hammer, an ordained minister.[3] In October 2009, the couple split after seven years of marriage. Later that month, Sprague filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She sought full custody of their son, Zen Scott Feldman, with Feldman having visitation rights. She also sought spousal support.[70] Feldman sought joint custody and wanted the court to block Sprague's spousal support demand.[71] After a five-year process, the couple's divorce became final in 2014.[72]
On November 22, 2016, Feldman married his long-time girlfriend, Courtney Anne Mitchell. The ceremony was officiated by producer Marklen Kennedy, at Elton John's Fizz champagne lounge at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.[73]
As an adult, Feldman has claimed that he is a survivor of child sexual abuse. According to him, he was molested by a man he first identified only as the alias "Ron Crimson", who worked as an assistant to Feldman's father.[74] Feldman has indicated that "Ron" facilitated his initiation into drug addiction.[74] Feldman later identified that man as actor and former personal assistant Cloyd Jon Grissom;[75] he also accused child agent Marty Weiss,[76] and former talent agent and Hollywood underage club owner Alphy Hoffman of having sexually abused him.[77]
On January 8, 2018, Feldman was accused of sexual battery. TMZ reported that an unidentified woman walked into a police station, filing a report that claimed Corey grabbed her buttocks in early 2017.[78] On February 5, 2018, the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles City Attorney's office cleared him of the charges.[79]
