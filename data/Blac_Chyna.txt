Chyna began stripping in Maryland to pay for her college tuition. While attending Johnson & Wales University in Miami, Florida, she resumed stripping and was too exhausted to attend classes. She dropped out after repeatedly falling asleep in class, focusing instead on stripping and modeling. She borrowed the name "Blac Chyna" from a customer. While stripping at a popular Miami club, her exotic look made her popular; radio host Angela Yee described her as looking "like someone who was going to be famous."[3] In 2010, Drake name-dropped her in "Miss Me".[3] Her rising popularity led to modeling jobs on the covers of Dimepiece, Straight Stuntin and Black Men's Magazine. Later in the same year, she was cast as Nicki Minaj's stunt double in the song "Monster" by Kanye West.[4]
During her career, Chyna had several surgeries to increase her breast size, she also had surgery to make them smaller.[5]
