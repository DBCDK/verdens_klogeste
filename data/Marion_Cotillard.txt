Variety's critic, Guy Lodge remarked: "Her deathless sleepwalking scene, staged in minimalist fashion under a gauze of snowflakes in a bare chapel, is played with tender, desolate exhaustion; it deserves to be viewed as near-definitive."[83] Cotillard was nominated for the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress for her performance.[84]
In 2015, Cotillard starred in New York Philharmonic's production of Arthur Honegger's oratorio "Joan of Arc at the Stake",[85][86] and voiced the roles of The Rose in both the English and the French version of The Little Prince, directed by Mark Osborne,[87] Scarlet Overkill in the French version of Minions,[88] and that of April in the French-Canadian-Belgian 3D animated film April and the Extraordinary World (Avril et le Monde Truqué), directed by Franck Ekinci and Christian Demares.[89][90]

Somehow, almost incomprehensibly, it all works. Allied looks old but smells new, and the scent is heady."[98] The film made US$120 million worldwide.[99] Cotillard re-teamed with Macbeth director Justin Kurzel and co-star Michael Fassbender in the film adaptation of the video game Assassin's Creed (also 2016).[100]
