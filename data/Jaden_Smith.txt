All of my homies inspired me. But the biggest inspiration in my life would be Kid Cudi and Tycho."[54] Smith also considers his father, Will Smith, as an inspiration saying "He started in music and transitioned to movies. I started with movies, and then I transitioned into making music – I look at him and use it as a blueprint of how good of a person he is, but not necessarily the success that he reached."[53]

Smith's father, Will, revealed that his son sought an emancipation ruling, with the consent of his parents, as a 15th birthday present. Will revealed to the media that Smith's primary motivation is the establishment of his own residence and also explained that his children are not subject to strict parenting conduct: "We generally don't believe in punishment. From the time Jaden was five or six we would sit him down, and all he has to do is be able to explain why what he did was the right thing for his life."[73] However, Smith and his father appeared together on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on May 15, 2013, and Smith said:
The thing that people don't get is everything at his house is free. So I can get anything and everything at his house, so I'm going to be there for 20, 30 more years.
