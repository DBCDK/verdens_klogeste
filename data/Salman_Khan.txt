In it, Khan played the role of a rich industrialist who hires a surrogate mother after his wife becomes infertile.[56] Sukanya Verma of Reddit wrote that the film had an absurd storyline, but also spontaneous performances from the cast, helping to minimise its other flaws.[56] In 2002 he starred in the release Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam[57].
For Tere Naam, (2003) Taran Adarsh said of him, "Salman Khan is exceptional in a role that fits him to the T. He breathes fire in sequences that demand uneasiness. But beneath the tough exterior lies a vulnerable person and this facet in particular comes to the fore in the latter reels. His emotional outbursts are splendid..."[58] Director Satish Kaushik considered Khan's work in the film to be strong, saying of it, "Salman has given a great performance in the film. He''s given an intense, unconventional performance. I believe this is the best performance of Salman''s career so far."[59] He continued his career with comedies like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and No Entry (2005).[50][better source needed]

Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama rated it 4 of 5 stars noting, "WANTED rides on Salman Khan's star power. He may not be the best actor in town, but in a film like WANTED, in a role that seems like an extension of his personality, you can't think of anyone else enacting this role with flourish."[62] Raja Sen from Rediff gave a rating of 2/5 and said "The writing is both amateurish and crass, while the songs are plain hideous...Khan might be having fun, but the fact a film like Wanted underscores is how badly Bollywood needs a breed of younger leading men. And how the existing lot need roles that fit."[63]
He appeared in two other films that year, Main Aurr Mrs Khanna and London Dreams[64]. Khan's first release of 2010 was Anil Sharma's film Veer[65].
In his next film, Dabangg, Khan played the role of a fearless cop with comic effect in the film[66].

On 6 May 2015, Khan was found guilty of all charges in the case. The Bombay Sessions Court concluded that Khan was driving the car under the influence of alcohol, causing the death of one and serious injury to four homeless persons. Sessions Judge DW Deshpande convicted the actor for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced him to five years in prison. Later in the same day, Khan, being represented by Senior Counsel Amit Desai was granted bail by the Bombay High Court till 8 May 2015,[180][181][182] on which the court suspended his prison sentence until the final appeal hearing in July.[183][184][185] His driver Ashok Singh, who had given the testimony that it was himself who was driving the car at the time of accident, was charged with perjury for misguiding the Court with false testimony and was arrested.[186] The kidnapping and eventual death of prime witness Police Constable Ravindra Patil remains a mystery, with some suspecting the involvement of organised crime.[187][188][189][190] In December 2015, Khan was acquitted of all charges from this case due to lack of evidence.[191][192] The Supreme Court on Tuesday 5 July 2016 admitted a plea by the Maharashtra government that challenged the acquittal of Salman Khan in this hit-and-run case by the Bombay High Court. The court refused to fast-track the case.[193]
His relationship with actress Aishwarya Rai was a well publicised topic in the Indian media.[194] After their break-up in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their break-up and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him.[195] In 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to organised crime and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the government's Forensic lab in Chandigarh, which concluded that it was fake.[196][197]
The case involves the alleged killing of a deer when Khan and his co-stars – Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabu — were filming the movie Hum Saath-Saath Hain in the forests near Jodhpur in 1998.[198][199] In 2007, Salman spent a week in Jodhpur jail before the court granted him bail. In addition to the accusations of poaching of endangered antelopes under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, a case under sections 3/25 and 3/27 of the Arms Act was filed against Khan for allegedly keeping and using firearms with an expired licence.[200]
On 17 February 2006, Khan was sentenced to one year in prison for hunting Chinkara, an endangered species. The sentence was stayed by a higher court on appeal.[201]
On 10 April 2006, Khan was handed a five-year jail term and remanded to Jodhpur jail until 13 April when he was granted bail.[202] On 24 July 2012, Rajasthan High Court finalised charges against Khan and his other colleagues in the endangered blackbuck killing case, paving way for the start of the trial.[203] On 9 July 2014, the Supreme Court issued a notice to Khan on Rajasthan government's plea challenging the High Court order suspending his conviction.[204] Khan was acquitted in the blackbuck and chinkara poaching cases by the Rajasthan High Court on 24 July 2016.[205]
On 18 October 2016 the Rajasthan Government decided to approach the Supreme Court to challenge Khan's acquittal in two related cases.[206]
On 18 January 2017 Khan was acquitted by a Jodhpur court in an Arms Act case linked to the killing of a blackbuck in Rajasthan. Khan pleaded "not guilty" to charges of violating the law by keeping unlicenced weapons and using them. Acquitting the actor, the court said that the prosecution failed to submit enough evidence against him.[200][207]

In September 2010, Khan was reported to have claimed during an interview on a Pakistani channel that the 26/11 attacks got a lot of attention because the "elite" were targeted.[210][211] During the interview the actor had said: "It was the elite that was targeted this time. Five star hotels and stuff. So they panicked. Then they got up and spoke about it. My question is "why not before?" Attacks have happened in trains and small towns too, but no one talked about it so much."[210][211] Khan also said that Pakistan was not to be blamed for it, and that the Indian security forces had failed.[212] Khan's comments had drawn strong reactions from Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Chagan Bhujbal, Shiv Sena, BJP and other political parties.[213] The comments were also condemned by Ujwal Nikam, Special Prosecutor in the 26/11 trial.[213] Khan later apologised for his comments.[210]

He also asked the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif to confirm "whether the mob boss is in his country."[215] The tweets sparked protests outside his house where police had to be deployed and was criticised in the social media and by his father, Salim Khan. Following these incidents, Khan withdrew his tweets and apologised.[216]
