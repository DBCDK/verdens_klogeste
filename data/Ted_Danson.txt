Danson was born in San Diego to Edward "Ned" Bridge Danson, Jr. (March 22, 1916 – November 30, 2000), an archaeologist and director of the Museum of Northern Arizona from 1959-1975, and Jessica MacMaster (November 2, 1916 – January 11, 2006),[5][6] and has an older sister, Jan Ann Haury (born January 11, 1944).[7][8] Danson was raised in Flagstaff, Arizona.[9] His ancestry includes English and Scottish.[10][11]
In 1961, Danson enrolled in the Kent School, a prep school in Connecticut, where he was a star player on the basketball team. He became interested in drama while attending Stanford University and, seeking a better acting program, transferred to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in drama in 1972.
Danson began his television career as a contract player on the daytime soap opera Somerset. He played the role of "Tom Conway" from 1975 to 1976. From 1977–1982 he played Dr. Mitchell Pearson on the daytime soap opera The Doctors. He was also in a number of commercials, most recognizably as the "Aramis man".
He made a number of guest appearances in episodic television in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including spots on Laverne and Shirley, B.J. and the Bear, Family, Benson, Taxi, Magnum P.I., The Amazing Spider-Man and Tucker's Witch.
In 1982 Danson was cast as the womanizing former baseball player and bartender Sam Malone on the NBC sitcom Cheers, in which he has an on-and-off relationship with college-educated, sophisticated Diane Chambers. Though the show finished last in the ratings in the first season, it was well received by critics. Ratings gradually improved in 1983 and by 1986 Cheers was one of the top ten shows on TV. The show had a run of 11 seasons and its finale (May 20, 1993) was watched by 80 million people, becoming the second most watched finale in television history at that time. It won four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series and a Golden Globe for Best Series – Musical or Comedy. The show ran from 1982 to 1993, with Danson receiving eleven consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nominations, ultimately winning two Emmys and two Golden Globes. In 2002, TV Guide named Cheers the 18th Greatest Show of All Time. It was also included in Time Magazine's 100 Greatest Shows of All Time.
Danson also appeared as Sam Malone in guest-starring roles on other sitcoms, such as Cheers spin-off Frasier, The Jim Henson Hour and The Simpsons.
Although he was best known for his work in comedy, he also appeared in a drama, Something About Amelia, about a family devastated by the repercussions of incest, which co-starred his later co-star on Damages, Glenn Close. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie and was nominated for an Emmy Award. In 1996, three years after Cheers concluded, Danson starred in the short-lived CBS sitcom Ink with his real-life wife Mary Steenburgen. In the same year, they starred as Lemuel Gulliver and his wife in an acclaimed television miniseries of Gulliver's Travels.
Danson went on to star in the successful CBS sitcom Becker (produced by Paramount Television, which also produced Cheers), which ran from 1998 to 2004. Danson also plays a fictionalized version of himself on Curb Your Enthusiasm. He reprised his role of Sam Malone in a second-season episode of Frasier and voiced him in The Simpsons episode "Fear of Flying".

In the second season Danson became a recurring character instead of one of the principal cast. Nevertheless, Danson received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series but lost to Michael J. Fox for his guest appearance in Rescue Me.
In 2011 Danson appeared in the music video for "Make Some Noise" by the Beastie Boys. He is also mentioned in the song's lyrics.
Danson starred in the HBO sitcom Bored to Death as George Christopher, the laconic, salubrious and sometime downright infantile editor of Edition magazine. Critics often praised Danson as being the highlight of the program, calling his character a "scene stealer".[12][13]
In July 2011 it was announced that Danson would star in the CBS police drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. He played D.B. Russell, a new graveyard shift supervisor who previously headed a crime lab in Seattle, Washington. Tony Shalhoub, Robin Williams and John Lithgow were also considered for the role.[2][3][14]
In March 2013 it was confirmed that Danson had signed a deal extending his stay on CSI for two more years.[15]
Following the cancellation of CSI, it was announced that his character would make a move over to the third spinoff show CSI: Cyber in the second season. The show was cancelled after two seasons.[16]
In 2015 Danson appeared in the second season of the TV show Fargo. He portrays sheriff Hank Larsson.[17] Since September 2016, Danson has appeared opposite Kristen Bell as the character Michael in the NBC sitcom The Good Place.[18] He has both been nominated for and won numerous awards for his performance as Michael.
Danson has also been featured in numerous films.

Danson spent several years caring for her and helping her recuperate. They later adopted a second daughter, Alexis.[citation needed]
Danson's affair with actress Whoopi Goldberg contributed to their divorce in 1993.[19] It is known as one of Hollywood's costliest divorces, reportedly costing Danson $30 million.[20]
On October 7, 1995, Danson married actress Mary Steenburgen, whom he met on the set of the movie Pontiac Moon in 1993, and became the stepfather to Steenburgen's children, Lilly and Charlie, from her previous marriage to actor Malcolm McDowell.[21]
Danson has been on a vegan diet multiple times,[22][23] but he currently adheres to a pescetarian diet.[24]
Danson is a descendant of Mayflower passenger William Brewster. This makes him a distant relative of the actress Jordana Brewster.
While a guest on The Arsenio Hall Show in late 1988, he met actress Whoopi Goldberg, whom he described as "a sexy, funny woman".[25] The two became friends, co-hosting Help Save Planet Earth in 1990, a video guide to saving the environment (Danson played himself, Goldberg played the role of Mother Earth).[26] However while making Made in America in April 1992, the two became romantically involved—a pairing which was heavily featured in gossip tabloids such as the National Enquirer. The couple also appeared on the Rock the Vote TV special that same year,[27] as well as being set to star in a Paramount-produced version of Neal Barrett Jr.'s Pink Vodka Blues,[28] written by Marshall Brickman.
Danson experienced substantial negative press attention on October 8, 1993, after his appearance in blackface at a Friars Club comedy roast in honor of Goldberg. In his monologue, Danson made extensive use of racial stereotypes, used the word "nigger" more than a dozen times, and ate a watermelon, angering such guests as Montel Williams and Mayor David Dinkins.[29][30] Goldberg defended the sketch, explaining that she had helped write much of the material and referred Danson to the makeup artist who painted his face.[31] Danson and Goldberg issued statements emphasizing "the Friars Club tradition of raucous and over the top humor" and describing those offended as newcomers who "were uncomfortable with what to expect".[29] Substantial excerpts from the performance were later printed in Spy.[32] On November 5, 1993, Danson and Goldberg issued a statement signalling the end of their relationship.[33]
Danson's interest in environmental concerns was ignited when he was twelve years old and Bill Breed, then curator of geology at the Museum of Northern Arizona, introduced Danson and friend Marc Gaede to a game he referred to as "billboarding". Armed with an axe and saw, Breed, Gaede, and Danson ended up destroying over 500 outdoor advertising signs.[34]
Danson's interest in environmentalism continued over the years, and he began to be concerned with the state of the world's oceans. In the 1980s, he was a contributing founder of the American Oceans Campaigns, which merged with Oceana in 2001, where Danson is a board member.[35]
Danson's commitment to the environment led him to host the A&E television series "Challenge of the Seas" in 1991, filming 26 one hour episodes.[citation needed]
In March 2011 Danson published his first book, Oceana: Our Endangered Oceans And What We Can Do To Save Them, written with journalist Michael D'Orso.[36][37]
On October 25, 2019, Danson was arrested with actress Jane Fonda at a climate change protest outside the United States Capitol at Washington, D.C.[38]
