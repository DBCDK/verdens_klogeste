Amal Alamuddin was born in Beirut, Lebanon. Her first name is derived from Arabic أمل ʾamal, meaning "hope".[8]
Her family left Lebanon when she was two years old, during the Lebanese Civil War, and settled in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.[9] Her father, Ramzi Alamuddin, a Lebanese Druze from Baakline (a village in the Chouf district),[10] received his MBA degree at the American University of Beirut. He returned to Lebanon in 1991.[11][12] Her mother, Bariaa (née Miknass), from a family of Sunni Muslims[13][10] from Tripoli in Northern Lebanon,[13][10] is a political journalist[14] and foreign editor of the Pan-Arab newspaper al-Hayat and a founder of the public relations company International Communication Experts, which is part of a larger company that specialises in celebrity guest bookings, publicity photography, and event promotion.[15]
