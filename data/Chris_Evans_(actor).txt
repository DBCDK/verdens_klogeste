The film was selected to debut at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival as one of the Spotlight projects for the 10th anniversary of the festival.[25] Also that year, Evans appeared in Sylvain White's The Losers, an adaptation of the comic-book series from the DC Comics imprint Vertigo.[26] Evans then appeared in another comic-book adaptation, Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, where he portrayed Lucas Lee, one of Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes.[27]
In 2011, Evans played the Marvel Comics character Captain America in Captain America: The First Avenger, and starred in the film What's Your Number?, a romantic comedy co-starring Anna Faris.[28][29] There were initially scheduling conflicts, as both films were set to film in mid-2010.[30] Evans had signed on to appear in multiple films as Captain America, and first reprised the role in the 2012 film The Avengers.[28]
He next starred opposite Michael Shannon in The Iceman, replacing James Franco, who had dropped out.[31] Evans wore a long wig and grew out a beard for the role.[32] He starred in South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's English-language film Snowpiercer.[33]

Evans said in March 2014 that once his contract with Marvel is up, he might consider doing less acting so he could work more on directing.[40][36] In September 2015, he said he would be willing to sign on for more films as Captain America after Infinity War if Marvel wanted to extend his contract.[41] However, he has since stated that he would retire from portraying the role after Avengers: Endgame.[42]

In 2012, Evans affirmed his support for same-sex marriage, stating: "It's insane that civil rights are being denied people in this day and age. It's embarrassing, and it's heartbreaking. It goes without saying that I'm completely in support of gay marriage. In ten years we'll be ashamed that this was an issue."[54] In August 2016, Evans supported Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's continued enforcement of the state's ban on assault weapons.[55]
Evans endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[56] He has also been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.[57][13]
In April 2019, Evans launched a website called A Starting Point, which is intended to "'demystify politics' by directly showcasing both Democratic and Republican lawmakers succinctly giving their position on 'dozens' of different political issues."[58][59] After Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act in May 2019, which imposes a near-total ban on abortions in the state, Evans wrote on Twitter that the bill was "absolutely unbelievable" and continued by saying, "If you're not worried about Roe v. Wade, you're not paying attention."[60]
