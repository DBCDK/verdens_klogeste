Roberts was born in Rhinebeck, New York,[2] to Kelly Cunningham and actor Eric Roberts.[3] Her parents separated when she was a baby. Through her father's marriage, she is the stepdaughter of Eliza Roberts and step-granddaughter of David Rayfiel and Lila Garrett. Through her mother's marriage, she is the stepdaughter of musician Kelly Nickels. She has a maternal half-sister, Grace.[4] Her paternal grandmother was acting coach Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015), and her aunts are actresses Julia Roberts and Lisa Roberts Gillan. During her childhood, Roberts spent time on the sets of her aunt Julia's films. These experiences sparked a desire to follow her father and aunts into the film industry.[4] Her mother initially wanted her to have a normal childhood.[5] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent through her father.[6][7]
Roberts made her acting debut at age nine in Ted Demme's 2001 drama film Blow. It was the first film for which she auditioned.[5] In the film, she portrayed Kristina Jung, the daughter of Johnny Depp's character (cocaine smuggler George Jung). That year, she also had a role in Leif Tilden's 10-minute short bigLove, and was an uncredited extra in some scenes featuring her aunt Julia Roberts in America's Sweethearts.[8] Roberts went on to appear in smaller roles in two family films: in 2002's Grand Champion, as the sister of the main character Buddy (Jacob Fisher); and in 2006's Spymate, as the kidnapped daughter of former secret agent Mike Muggins (Chris Potter), who tries to rescue her with the help of a spy monkey. Grand Champion had a brief theatrical release in August 2004,[9] while Spymate was not released until February 2006, when it was given a theatrical run in Canada,[10] followed by its DVD release in April 2006.
In 2004, she began starring as the lead character Addie Singer in the Nickelodeon series Unfabulous,[11] which debuted in September of that year. The sitcom earned Roberts several Teen Choice Award and Young Artist Award nominations.[12] The series focused on a seventh grader, Addie, and her two best friends. It aired for three seasons (2004–2007). The show also spawned TV movies, including The Perfect Moment. Also in 2004, Roberts guest starred in an episode of the Nickelodeon series Drake & Josh titled "Honor Council". After her run on Unfabulous, Nickelodeon had considered giving Roberts a kick start into a music career.[13] In 2006, Roberts returned to the big screen, starring alongside Sara Paxton and singer JoJo in Aquamarine.

In 2008, Roberts starred as the lead in the film Wild Child,[21] about a rebellious teen from Malibu, California sent to a boarding school in England. Roberts described her character as "pretty much your typical spoiled-brat Malibu socialite who gets shipped off to a British boarding school."[22] Roberts also appeared in two films: Lymelife, which was premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and The Flight Before Christmas, where she had her voiceover debut when she voiced the English version of the character Wilma.[23] In 2009, Roberts starred alongside Jake T.

Roberts played a recent college graduate who works at an adult bookstore to make ends meet. She has said that most of her lines were ad-libbed so her reactions in the film were completely genuine.[35] Her performance was praised by both Andrew O'Hehir of Salon and Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice, who praised Roberts' performance as "both breezy and carefully tuned".[36] In the next month, she guest starred as Amanda Barrington in the animated sitcom Family Guy, in the episode "No Country Club for Old Men".[37]

The film was released on August 29, 2013. It received generally positive reviews, with particular praise for Roberts' performance. Tom Shone of The Guardian and Ian Freer of Empire both called her the "standout" of the film,[39] with Freer praising her performance for being "heartbreaking as she suggests longings and anxieties without over-hyping it. Much like the film itself."[40] She next appeared in season three of the FX anthology horror series American Horror Story, called American Horror Story: Coven, in a main role from late 2013 through January 2014. Roberts portrayed a self-involved party girl named Madison Montgomery, who also happens to be a telekinetic witch.[41] She then portrayed Maggie Esmerelda, a con artist posing as a fortune teller, in American Horror Story: Freak Show.[42]

However, following the Dayton and El Paso mass shootings in early August 2019, Universal Pictures decided to shelve the release of the film.[69] The decision came a day after criticism regarding the film came from current president of the United States Donald Trump.[70] From September through November 2019, Roberts starred in the ninth season of American Horror Story, subtitled 1984, portraying Brooke Thompson.[71][72]

Roberts said in a 2007 interview: "Right now I am focusing on movies. I am getting ready to start a new movie this summer so that is taking a lot of my time. I think when I am a little bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue."[74] In another interview, she said: "My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both. You're going to be better at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting."[75]
From 2007 to 2008, Roberts was in a relationship with actor Alex Pettyfer.[76] During their relationship, he got her initials tattooed on his wrist.[77]

Roberts began dating actor Evan Peters in 2012 after they worked together in the film Adult World.[79] In July 2013, while they were staying at a hotel in Montreal, Quebec, someone overheard a dispute coming from their room and called the police. After a "heated argument", they had begun hitting each other.[80] When the police arrived, they arrested Roberts. Peters was not arrested because Roberts did not have any immediately visible injuries.[81] Peters declined to press charges and Roberts was released several hours later.[82] In a joint statement, the couple called it "an unfortunate incident and misunderstanding," and stated that they "are working together to move past it."[82]  Peters confirmed in March 2014 that he and Roberts were engaged.[83] In March 2019, it was reported that Roberts and Peters had split.[84]
