I was told if I ever went back to the United States, three things were going to happen. One: I was going to amount to nothing. Two: I was going to work at Whataburger. And three: I was going to end up a slut. So, it was like, I can't go back. I have to be this person."[citation needed] After returning to the U.S., she attended the Las Vegas Academy and Alta High School.[19]
