Lisa Olivia Munn was born July 3, 1980[1] in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She is of German, Irish, English, Vietnamese and Chinese ancestry.[2] Her mother, Kimberly Schmid, was born and raised in Vietnam and is of Vietnamese Chinese descent.[3][4] Her mother fled to Oklahoma as a Vietnamese refugee in 1975 after the Vietnam War.[5] After college, her mother married Winston Munn.[6][7][8]
When Munn was two years old, her parents divorced and her mother remarried to a member of the United States Air Force. Although the family relocated many times, Munn was predominantly raised on Yokota Air Base near Tachikawa in Tokyo, Japan,[9][10] where her stepfather was stationed. She has said that her stepfather was "verbally abusive" and demeaning.[11] Munn has two brothers, John, a physicist, and James, a custom motorcycle shop owner. She also has a sister named Sara, who is a lawyer.[12]
Her mother and stepfather divorced when Munn was a teenager, and she moved back to Oklahoma with her mother, where she attended Putnam City North High School for her junior and senior years of high school.[13][14] After graduating, Munn attended the University of Oklahoma, where she earned a B.A. in journalism with a minor in Japanese and dramatic arts.[3][15]
She became an intern at the NBC affiliate in Tulsa,[16] and later moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.
In 2004, Munn interned at Fox Sports Networks and worked as a sideline reporter for college football and women's basketball. She has gone on to say that she disliked the experience, explaining, "I was trying to be something I wasn't, and that made me really uncomfortable on live TV."[10]
Soon after she moved to Los Angeles, Munn was cast in a small role in the direct-to-video horror film Scarecrow Gone Wild. She appeared in rock band Zebrahead's music video for their song "Hello Tomorrow" as the love interest of the lead singer Justin Mauriello.[17]
Munn also appeared in National Lampoon's Strip Poker, which was filmed at Hedonism II, a naturist resort in Negril, Jamaica, with Kato Kaelin. The films aired on DirecTV and In Demand pay-per-view.
In late 2005, Munn began her role as teen surfer Mily Acuna over two seasons of the television drama Beyond the Break on The N network.[18] She enjoys surfing and continues to practice the sport.[19] She originally auditioned for the role of Kai Kealoha, but the producers wanted a "local girl".[20] She also appeared in the film The Road to Canyon Lake.[21]
In 2006, Munn moved on to the G4 network, where she began co-hosting Attack of the Show! with Kevin Pereira on 10 April. She replaced departing host Sarah Lane. The network, devoted to the world of video games and the video games lifestyle, was at first hesitant to hire Munn. Although she admits video games were her "weak point", she was confident in her technical knowledge.[22] On the show, Munn was featured with journalist Anna David in a segment called "In Your Pants", which deals with sex and relationship questions from viewers. While working on Attack of the Show!, Munn hosted Formula D, a now defunct program about American drift racing, and an online podcast called Around the Net, formerly known as The Daily Nut,  for G4. Munn left Attack of the Show! in December 2010 and was replaced by Candace Bailey.[23] Munn appeared in the Rob Schneider film Big Stan (2007). She played Schneider's character's receptionist Maria.[10] Munn had a significant role in the horror film Insanitarium in which she played a nurse at an insane asylum.

In May 2010, NBC announced that Munn would star on the television series Perfect Couples. The half-hour romantic comedy premiered on January 20, 2011.[26] The series was cancelled before it completed its first season run.[27]
On June 3, 2010, Munn debuted in her new role as a correspondent on Comedy Central's The Daily Show.[28] Her hiring prompted criticism from Irin Carmon of Jezebel, who questioned Munn's credentials and said the show's production was sexist for hiring Munn, whom Carmon said was a sex symbol.[29] Carmon said Munn's hiring was a perpetuation of the show production office's history as a male-dominated atmosphere marginalizing and alienating to women.[30] A group of thirty-two female Daily Show production staff members said Carmon's piece was inaccurate and misinformed. Munn said that Carmon's assertion was an insult both to her and to the rest of the Daily Show staff.[31][32] She went on to appear in 16 more episodes as a correspondent, with TV Guide naming her signature segment "Tiger Mothering," in which she mocked the high expectations of Chinese mothers, in part by interviewing her own mother.[33] Her last episode as a correspondent aired September 2, 2011. She returned for a brief segment in host Jon Stewart's final show on August 6, 2015.

As of June 2014, Munn has been hired as the main promoter of Proactiv acne cleanser products starring in several commercials and one infomercial for the product. The commercials show Munn experiencing acne herself. Since January 2015, she has been the voice of the character Phoebe Callisto on the Disney Junior animated series Miles from Tomorrowland.
