Poehler was born on September 16, 1971,[1][2] in Newton, Massachusetts, to school teachers Eileen and William Poehler.[3][4] Eileen was active in feminism in the 1970s, something that inspired Poehler's own sense of confidence.[5][6] Poehler credits her father with encouraging her to break social protocol and take risks.[5] She has one younger brother, Greg, who is a producer and actor.[7][5] She is of Irish, German, Portuguese, and English descent with her Irish roots originating from County Cork.[4] She was raised as a Catholic.[8]
She grew up in nearby Burlington, Massachusetts, which Poehler describes as a blue-collar town.[3][5] Her favorite performers included sketch-comedians Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, and Catherine O'Hara.[9] When she was 10 years old, Poehler played Dorothy in her school's production of The Wizard Of Oz.[10] The experience inspired Poehler's love of performing.[10][11] Poehler continued acting in school plays at Burlington High School. She also participated in other activities during her time in high school including student counsel, soccer and softball. After graduating from high school in 1989, she enrolled at Boston College.[12] During college, Poehler became a member of the improv comedy troupe My Mother's Fleabag.[3] She graduated from Boston College with a bachelor's degree in media and communications in 1993.[13]
Poehler's time studying improv in college inspired her to pursue comedy professionally.[14] After graduating from college, she moved to Chicago where she took her first improv class taught by Charna Halpern at ImprovOlympic.[15] Early on, Poehler worked as a waitress and at other small jobs to earn money.[14] Through ImprovOlympic, Poehler learned from Del Close and she was introduced to friend and frequent collaborator Tina Fey.[15][16] Poehler and Fey joined a Second City touring company at the same time, and Poehler went on to join one of Second City's main companies where Fey was her eventual replacement.[16]
The Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) formed as a sketch and improv group in Chicago in 1991.[17][18] Early members included Horatio Sanz, Adam McKay, Ian Roberts, Neil Flynn and Matt Besser, although membership was not static.[17][18][19] McKay left the fledgling group in 1995, and Poehler became his replacement.[17][18] In 1996, a core group of four UCB members, Poehler, Besser, Roberts, and Matt Walsh moved to New York City.[19][20][21] The "UCB Four" began performing shows at small venues around the city which evolved into four regular live shows after a few months.[17] To earn money outside of the shows, UCB taught improv classes.[17] Poehler also started making appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, often playing her recurring role as Andy Richter's little sister, Stacy.[8][22]
In 1998, Comedy Central debuted UCB's eponymous half-hour sketch comedy series.[17] During the show's second season, the group founded an improv theater/training center in New York City on W. 22nd Street, occupying the space of a former strip club.[17] The UCB Theatre held shows seven nights a week in addition to offering classes in sketch comedy writing and improv.[8] In the summer of 2000, Comedy Central canceled the Upright Citizens Brigade program after its third season,[19] though the UCB Theatre continued to operate.[23] Poehler, Besser, Roberts, and Walsh are considered the founders of UCB and have been credited with popularizing long-form improv in New York.[17][24][25] By 2011, UCB had two theaters in New York and a theater in Los Angeles with 8,000 students taking classes per year.[17]

Poehler joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL) at the start of the 2001–2002 season. Tina Fey had tried to recruit her for SNL for years.[16] Poehler made her debut in the first episode produced after the 9/11 attacks. She was promoted from featured player to full cast member in her first season on the show, making her the second cast member,[a] and first woman, to earn this distinction.[26][27] Poehler's recurring characters included hyperactive 10-year old Kaitlyn, one-legged reality show contestant Amber, and Bronx Beat talk show co-host Betty Caruso.[19][28] In addition to her original characters, Poehler performed a number of impressions including: Hillary Clinton, Kelly Ripa, Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, Katie Couric, Sharon Osbourne, Nancy Grace, Dakota Fanning, Michael Jackson, and Kim Jong-Il.[19][28]Beginning with the 2004–2005 season, she co-anchored Weekend Update with Tina Fey, replacing Jimmy Fallon. Fey and Poehler became the first female co-anchors of the longtime SNL staple.[16] Poehler, Rudolph, and Fey were among the shows biggest stars that season and contributed to a shift in the show to featuring more female driven sketches.[19][27][29] When Fey left after the 2005–2006 season to devote time to the sitcom she created, 30 Rock, Seth Meyers joined Poehler at the Weekend-Update anchor desk. In 2008, Poehler was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series,[30] the first year SNL cast members were eligible for the category.[31]
The SNL premiere of the 2008–2009 season opened with Fey and Poehler as Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton, respectively, discussing sexism in political campaigning.[32][33] The sketch, which Poehler co-wrote with Meyers, became the biggest viral video of the year.[32][34] Days after the season premiere, NBC announced Poehler, pregnant with her first child, would not return after her upcoming maternity leave.[35] On the October 25th episode, Meyers announced during Weekend Update that Poehler was giving birth. At the end of Weekend Update, special guest Maya Rudolph and cast member Kenan Thompson sang a custom rendition of "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" for Poehler.[36] Poehler had been rehearsing for that week's show until the day before the baby was born.[36]
After giving birth, Poehler appeared during a pre-taped "SNL Presidential Bash '08"  prime time special on November 3.[37][38] Despite the prior announcement that Poehler would not return after her maternity leave, she came back for two more live episodes.[39][40] During the December 13 Weekend Update, Poehler announced that it was her last show.[40] Saturday Night Live aired a special, "The Best of Amy Poehler," in April 2009.[41] For the 2008-2009 season finale, Poehler returned to co-host Weekend Update  and joined host Will Ferrell's version of the Billy Joel song "Goodnight Saigon."[42][43]
Off camera, Poehler was a prolific writer. She often collaborated with writer Emily Spivey.[44] Meyers described Poehler as "the most generous laugher" during sketch read throughs.[5] Poehler would also take it upon herself to welcome guest hosts during rehearsals and try to make them feel comfortable during their stint on SNL.[5]
Although she had already left SNL, Poehler joined Meyers in September 2009 for two episodes of Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday, which aired in prime time and led directly into Parks and Recreation.[45][46] She returned to SNL along with other past female cast members for a special Mother's Day episode on May 8, 2010, hosted by Betty White.[47][48] Poehler returned again to host the 2010–2011 season premiere with musical guest Katy Perry.[49] She participated in another SNL prime time special, The Women of SNL in November of that year.[50] Poehler also returned sporadically for appearances on Weekend Update with Meyers, as well as in sketches when Jimmy Fallon (2011) and Maya Rudolph (2012) hosted.[51][52]
In 2015, during the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, she returned to anchor Weekend Update, this time with Tina Fey and Jane Curtin.[53]
Following the success of The Office, NBC ordered a new series from producers Greg Daniels and Michael Schur.[54] In July 2008, Variety reported that Poehler was in final negotiations to star in the still untitled series from Daniels and Schur.[55] Poehler and Schur were friends from their time together at SNL where Schur worked as a writer.[56] Signing Poehler, who was pregnant with her first child, meant the new series would have to forgo a promised post-Super Bowl debut and cut its first season short, but Daniels and Schur chose to push back the series for Poehler.[56][57] On July 21, 2008, NBC announced Poehler's new series, Parks and Recreation, saying the project would not be a direct spin-off of The Office, as previously speculated.[54]
Parks and Recreation premiered on NBC on April 9, 2009, at 8:30 pm between two episodes of The Office.[58][59] An ensemble cast including Aziz Ansari, Rashida Jones, Chris Pratt, Aubrey Plaza, Paul Schneider, and Nick Offerman joined Poehler.[56] Poehler played Deputy Director of the Parks Department, Leslie Knope, in the fictional city of Pawnee, Indiana. After the first season had received a mixed reception, the show's second season received more positive reviews.[60] One key change between seasons one and two was to distinguish the character of Leslie from Michael Scott, the central character of The Office.[56][60] Parks decidedly down-played Leslie's ditziness from season one and emphasized her intelligence, work ethic and earnest nature instead.[56][60] A second-season episode, Galentine's Day, included a new holiday Leslie created celebrating female friendship on February 13. Galentine's Day has since transcended the show with real life celebrations.[61][62] Adam Scott and Rob Lowe joined the show at the end of season two with Scott playing Leslie's eventual love interest Ben.[63] At the end of filming season two, Poehler was once again pregnant. The show began producing the first six episodes of season three without a break to accommodate her pregnancy.[63][64][65] Poehler was  nominated again for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy in 2011.[66] In 2011, the show won a Peabody Award for "developing a hilarious venue to explore the good side of American democracy in an age when that side is so rarely on display."[67]  By season five, the show was a success with critics, but its future was still uncertain. Two episodes were written that could serve as series finales if it was cancelled, including the mid-season episode where Leslie and Ben get married.[68] The show was ultimately renewed for a sixth season in May 2013.[69] Poehler was nominated for an Emmy Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy in 2013 for her work in season five. Season six included the show's 100th episode, "Second Chunce", co-written by Poehler and Schur.[70] In 2014, she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series – Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, which she co-hosted with Tina Fey.[71] In the middle of season six, Poehler and Schur decided that it felt like the right time to plan the end of the show. They met with representatives from NBC, who agreed. The show was renewed for a final thirteen-episode season.[68] Poehler and Schur co-wrote the final episode of the series, "One Last Ride",  which aired on February 24, 2015.[63]
In addition to starring on Parks and Recreation, Poehler was also a producer.[72] Behind the scenes, Poehler started a tradition of inviting the show cast and crew to a group dinner the last night of any location shoot.[5] Poehler would start impromptu dance parties in the makeup trailer on set.[73] Poehler wrote several episodes throughout the series, starting with the season two episode "Telethon".[74][75] Other episodes she penned include "The Fight" (season three),[75] "The Debate" (season four),[76] "Second Chunce" (season five) and the finale "One Last Ride". Producer Dan Goor praised Poehler's writing as "exceptionally good" and theorized, "[i]f Amy Poehler submitted a blind script to any staff, she would be hired."[77] Poehler's writing of "The Debate" was recognized with nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Comedy.[30][78] In addition to writing "The Debate," Poehler also directed the episode.[76] Additionally, she directed the episodes "Article Two" (season five)[79] and "Gryzzlbox" (season seven).[80]

The program was watched by 20 million viewers, a 17 percent increase over the previous year.[16] The pair co-hosted again in 2014 as part of a three-year contract.[81][82] Gilbert Cruz, of the Vulture website, wrote: "They killed it last year with their opening monologue and they did so again this year."[83] The 2014 show garnered its highest ratings in ten years.[71]
2015 marked the third successive time Poehler and Fey hosted the Golden Globe Awards. Before the event they confirmed it would be their last time.[82] Rolling Stone magazine wrote afterward that the pair "left no superstar unscathed during their riotous opening monologue" in which they "casually roasted the assembled masses".[84] At the 2020 Television Critics Association winter press tour, NBC announced Poehler and Fey would host the Golden Globes again in 2021.[85]
