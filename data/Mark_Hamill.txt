Mark Richard Hamill (/ˈhæmɪl/; born September 25, 1951) is an American actor, voice actor, and writer. Hamill is best known for playing Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars films, which won him the Saturn Award for Best Actor three times. He is also known for his voice acting in animation and video games, especially for his portrayal of the Joker, beginning with Batman: The Animated Series in 1992.
Hamill was born in Oakland, California, to Virginia Suzanne (née Johnson) and U.S. Navy Captain William Thomas Hamill.[1] He is one of seven children, having two brothers, Will and Patrick, and four sisters, Terry, Jan, Jeanie, and Kim.[2] His father has English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh ancestry and his mother was of half Swedish and half English descent.[3][4]  Hamill has described his father as a staunch Roman Catholic, and "Nixon Republican."[5]
His father's changes of station and attendant family moves led to the Hamill children switching schools often. In his elementary years, he went to Walsingham Academy and Poe Middle School.[6] At age 11, he moved to the 5900 block of Castleton Drive in San Diego, California, where he attended Hale Junior High School.[7] During his first year at James Madison High School, his family moved to Virginia, and Hamill attended Annandale High School.[8] By his junior year, his father was stationed in Japan, where Hamill attended and was a member of the Drama Club at Nile C. Kinnick High School, from which he graduated in 1969.[9][10] He later enrolled at Los Angeles City College, majoring in drama.[8]
Hamill's early career included a recurring role on the soap opera General Hospital,[11] and a starring role on the short-lived sitcom The Texas Wheelers.[12] He portrayed the oldest son, David, in the pilot episode of Eight Is Enough, though the role was later performed by Grant Goodeve.[13] He also had guest appearances on The Bill Cosby Show,[14] The Partridge Family,[15] Room 222 and One Day at a Time.[1] He appeared in multiple television films such as The City,[1] and Sarah T. - Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic.[1]
Robert Englund was auditioning for a role in Apocalypse Now when he walked across the hall where auditions were taking place for George Lucas's Star Wars. After watching the auditions for a while, he realized that Hamill, his friend, would be perfect for the role of Luke Skywalker.[14] He suggested to Hamill that he audition for the role; Hamill did and won the role.[16]
Released in May 1977, Star Wars was an enormous, unexpected success and had a huge effect on the film industry. Hamill also appeared in the Star Wars Holiday Special in 1978[17] and later starred in the successful sequels The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. During the time between the first two films, Hamill was involved in a serious automobile accident, fracturing his nose and left cheekbone.[14] False rumors spread that he required plastic surgery on his face.[18] For both of the sequels, Hamill was honored with the Saturn Award for Best Actor given by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films.
Hamill reprised the role of Luke Skywalker for the radio dramatizations of both Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. For the Return of the Jedi radio drama, the role was played by a different actor.
Editions of Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces (which influenced Lucas as he was developing the films) issued after the release of Star Wars in 1977 used the image of Hamill as Luke Skywalker on the cover.[19][20]
Hamill returned to the Star Wars universe in 2014, when he voiced the ancient Sith Lord Darth Bane,[21] in the final episode of the animated series The Clone Wars. He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for his performance.
With the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, a Disney press release was announced that there would be more Star Wars films starting with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was released on December 18, 2015. Hamill appeared in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[22]
Initially, both Disney and Hamill were coy about whether Hamill would be a cast member of The Force Awakens.[23][24] In September 2013, Englund, actor and long-time friend of Hamill, said that Hamill was currently working out in the gym. Englund stated, "Mark now – they've got Mark in the gym because Mark's coming back as Luke Skywalker. They've got him doing his sit-ups." It was previously reported that both Hamill and Carrie Fisher had been assigned nutritionists and personal trainers to work with ahead of production.[25]
Hamill played Skywalker again in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, released on December 15, 2017.[26] Hamill was critical of his own role in The Last Jedi, stating that he and director Rian Johnson had "a fundamental difference" on the characterization of Luke Skywalker.[27][28][29] Hamill later expressed regret for having made those statements[30] and reprised his role as Skywalker for the last time in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.[31]
After the success of Star Wars, Hamill found that audiences identified him very closely with the role of Luke Skywalker,[32] after which he became a teen idol and appeared on teen magazine covers such as Tiger Beat and others. He attempted to avoid typecasting by appearing in the 1978 film Corvette Summer[14] and the better-known 1980 World War II film The Big Red One.[21] In 1980, he also made a guest appearance on The Muppet Show,  both as himself and as Luke Skywalker in The Stars of Star Wars;[33] this episode also starred C-3PO and R2-D2 who were along with him on a search for Chewbacca.[34] Other film appearances around this time include The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia in 1981[35] and Britannia Hospital in 1982.[36] To further distance himself from his early blockbuster role, Hamill started acting on Broadway, starring in plays such as The Elephant Man in 1979,[37] Amadeus in 1983,[38] Harrigan 'N Hart in 1985 (for which he received a Drama Desk Award nomination),[39] Room Service in 1986[40] and The Nerd in 1987–88.[41] When Amadeus was adapted to film in 1984, Hamill auditioned to reprise the role for the big screen but lost the part to Tom Hulce.[21][42] A studio executive told the producers of the film, "I don't want Luke Skywalker in this film".[43] He made television appearances in a 1986 episode of Amazing Stories and a 1987 episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.
Hamill returned to film after a six-year hiatus with the 1989 science fiction film Slipstream.[44] He continued to star in films throughout the 1990s, including in such films as the thriller Midnight Ride,[45][46] The Guyver in 1991,[47] the 1995 remake of Village of the Damned,[48] and the 1998 Swedish action film Hamilton.[49] Hamill appeared in the 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back as the supervillain Cocknocker, a role which parodies both himself and roles he has played in the past.[50]
He guest appeared in two episodes as the Trickster in the live-action 1990 television series of The Flash.[51] He has made cameo appearances on MADtv, where he played the estranged father of Ms. Swan,[citation needed] and appeared on Saturday Night Live playing himself being sold on a Star Wars-themed home shopping sale.[52] Hamill appeared in single episodes of 3rd Rock from the Sun in 1997,[53] Just Shoot Me! in 1998[54] and in two episodes of seaQuest DSV in 1995 (as Tobias LeConte).[55] He also appeared in the episode "Mind over Matter" of the 1995 television series The Outer Limits.
When the Wing Commander series of computer games started using full motion video cut scenes, Hamill was cast as the series protagonist, Colonel Christopher Blair, a role he played in Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom and Wing Commander: Prophecy.[56] In the 1999 Wing Commander film, set earlier in the series, the character was played by Freddie Prinze, Jr., although Hamill had a voice cameo.[57] Hamill appears in Squadron 42, the single player campaign from the Star Citizen computer game universe as Lieutenant Commander Steve "Old Man" Colton.[58][59]
In 2003, Hamill starred in the two-hander play Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks as the acerbic dance instructor Michael Minetti.  He played opposite Rue McClanahan for the season at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, and opposite Polly Bergen as the production moved on to Broadway.[60][61]
Hamill also directed and starred in the 2004 direct-to-DVD Comic Book: The Movie.[62] A comic book fan who attended science fiction and comic conventions before he became famous, Hamill stated that his character was based on an exaggerated version of himself. He and his crew shot most of the "mockumentary" film during the 2002 San Diego Comic-Con and enlisted Stan Lee, Kevin Smith, Bruce Campbell and Hugh Hefner in small roles. The movie won an award for Best Live-Action DVD Premiere Movie at the 2005 DVD Exclusive Awards.[citation needed]
In 2011, Hamill appeared as a villain in the fifth season of the NBC series Chuck.[63]

Hamill did not star in any live-action films for a number of years until 2011 when he starred in the Hungarian film Thelomeris, on which he was a creative consultant. The film was the first mainstream science fiction film to be released in Hungary.[65]
The next year, Hamill starred in two more live-action films, British horror film Airborne and the small independent film Sushi Girl. Airborne was met with a negative reception from critics and audiences.[66] Hamill said in an interview that Sushi Girl was a great challenge for him as it took him out of his comfort zone since it was such a dark film. He did not accept the role until he got encouragement from his daughter, who said he would be crazy not to accept it.[67]
In 2014, Hamill played James Arnold, an academic professor from Imperial College London and an expert in climate change, in the film Kingsman: The Secret Service. In addition, he reprised his role as the Trickster on The CW's 2014 live-action series The Flash, in the seventeenth episode of the first season, the ninth episode of the second season, and the ninth episode of the third season.[68]
He stars in the 2018 film Con Man, an independent film about the life of Barry Minkow, the famous con man. Hamill plays Minkow's father, Robert Minkow.[69]
Hamill first did voice acting work in the early 1970s voicing the character Corey Anders on the Saturday morning cartoon Jeannie by Hanna-Barbera Productions. He later played Sean in the Ralph Bakshi film Wizards,[14] which was released just three months before Star Wars in 1977.
Though the voice role he is most known for is Batman's archenemy the Joker,[21] his success as the Joker has led him to portray a wide variety of characters in television, film, anime, and video games (mostly similar super-villains).

The creator of Kingdom Hearts, Tetsuya Nomura, is a big fan of all of Hamill's work. There is also another character, Master Xehanort, who was originally voiced by Leonard Nimoy, the actor of Spock. Tetsuya Nomura stated that they wanted the two for the roles, as the two characters are rivals, referencing the rivalry between fans of Star Wars and fans of Star Trek (though Nimoy was replaced by Rutger Hauer for Kingdom Hearts III following his death). He also narrated Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, the title being a reference to the 1980 war film he starred in.

This sequence featured Hamill voicing Joker, dubbed over actor/stuntman Roger Stoneburner whose facial structure more resembled the character.[citation needed] The actor's face was shot in the background so as to be slightly blurred.[relevant?  – discuss]
Hamill voiced the Joker alongside his Batman: The Animated Series co-star Kevin Conroy as Batman and Jason Hillhouse as Dick Grayson in a feature of a storyboard scene included in the 2005 Special Edition DVD of Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman.[citation needed] This scene depicted the origin of Robin, which was not filmed because the producers felt it was out-of-place with the rest of the film.[citation needed]
Hamill has said that he has voiced the Joker for toys and amusement park rides. Although these jobs did not pay particularly well, he enjoyed even these small roles and admitted being protective of the character, preferring not to let "others sleep in my sleeping bag";[75] he also self-identifies as a "real comic book nerd".[76]
Hamill has portrayed the Joker in a few Batman-themed video games, such as Batman Vengeance,[citation needed] the Sega CD version of The Adventures of Batman & Robin,[citation needed] and in Batman: Arkham Asylum.[14][75] Hamill again reprised the role in the Arkham sequel, Batman: Arkham City.[77] In May 2010, Hamill declared to IGN UK that his role in Arkham City would be his last as the Joker.[76][failed verification] Some months later, with the announcement of Arkham City, he clarified his statements in the interview by saying, via his Twitter account, "Only said Arkham Asylum would be hard to top, not that I was quitting."[78] On October 19, 2011, shortly after the release of the game, Hamill announced his retirement on his Twitter account, saying "Hello/Goodbye Joker!

According to a 1981 profile in People, Hamill's "first serious love" was co-actor Anne Wyndham, cast as his sister on General Hospital, with whom he had an offscreen relationship.[8] Hamill would later describe experiencing seasons of on-set tension while working with her after their relationship ended.[93] In a 2017 interview, Hamill attributed his long, happy marriage to a non-actor to learning, through his relationship with Wyndham, the danger of being competitive when in a relationship with a fellow actor.[94]

On January 11, 1977, before shooting one of his scenes in Star Wars, Hamill was in a car accident in which he fractured his nose and left cheekbone,[99] requiring seven hours of surgery. As a result, a double was used for the landspeeder pickup shots.[100] According to Hamill in a recorded interview, he was driving his BMW on a freeway, became distracted, and seeing that he was missing his offramp, attempted to negotiate four lanes of traffic. Hamill later said that the stories surrounding his injuries had become exaggerated. Confirming that he had only broken his nose, Hamill observed that "over the years it's [been] built up into having my face reconstructed with plastic surgery."[18]
