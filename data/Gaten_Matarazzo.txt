Gaetano John "Gaten" Matarazzo III[1] (/ˈɡeɪtən ˌmætəˈræzoʊ/; Italian: [mataˈrattso]; born September 8, 2002)[2] is an American actor and singer. He began his career on the Broadway stage as Benjamin in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and as Gavroche in Les Misérables.[3] He stars as Dustin Henderson in the Netflix science-fiction-horror drama series Stranger Things, and hosts the Netflix show Prank Encounters. He is also the lead singer of the indie rock band Work In Progress.
Matarazzo was raised in Little Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, and attended Pinelands Regional High School in Tuckerton, New Jersey.[4]
Matarazzo is of Italian descent.[5][6] Matarazzo has cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), a trait he shares with his Stranger Things character.[7] He uses dentures as a result of his condition.[8]
Matarazzo uses his platform to raise awareness of CCD and fundraise for CCD Smiles, an organization that helps cover costs of oral surgeries for people with CCD. Matarazzo has also started a line of T-shirts whose proceeds will go to CCD Smiles. On his social media sites, Matarazzo tells followers how to donate to CCD Smiles and promotes events he will participate in. In November 2017, his sister started a Facebook campaign to raise money for the organization.[9][10]
