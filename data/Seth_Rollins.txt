Colby Lopez (born May 28, 1986) is an American professional wrestler currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Seth Rollins, and is the currently one-half of the WWE Raw Tag Team Champions in his record sixth reign.
Lopez signed with WWE in 2010 and was sent to its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) where he was renamed Seth Rollins and became the inaugural FCW Grand Slam Champion. After WWE rebranded FCW into NXT, he became the inaugural NXT Champion. Alongside Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, he debuted on WWE's main roster at the 2012 Survivor Series as part of a faction called The Shield. He won his first main roster championship while with the group, the WWE Tag Team Championship with Reigns. Following the team's first breakup in June 2014, Rollins went on to become a two-time WWE Champion, two-time Universal Champion, two-time Intercontinental Champion, one-time United States Champion, record six-time WWE/Raw Tag Team Champion (with Reigns, Ambrose (twice), Jason Jordan, Braun Strowman and Buddy Murphy), the 2014 Money in the Bank winner, the 2015 Superstar of the Year and the 2019 Men's Royal Rumble winner.
Prior to signing with WWE, Lopez wrestled under the ring name Tyler Black for Ring of Honor (ROH), where he held the ROH World Championship once and the ROH World Tag Team Championship twice (with Jimmy Jacobs), as well as the winner of the 2009 Survival of the Fittest tournament. He also wrestled for various independent promotions including Full Impact Pro (FIP), where he was a one-time FIP World Heavyweight Champion, as well as Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), where he was a one-time PWG World Tag Team Champion (also with Jacobs).
Upon capturing the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in 2015, and after winning his first Intercontinental Championship, he became the 29th Triple Crown Champion and the 18th Grand Slam Champion. He is the only wrestler to have held all three of WWE's main brand world titles (WWE, Universal, and NXT Championships).
Rollins has headlined numerous major pay-per-view events for WWE, including WrestleMania 31. Industry veteran Sting, who wrestled his final match against Rollins, described him as the most talented professional wrestler he has ever seen or worked with.[6] He was the cover athlete for video game WWE 2K18.[7] He has been named the No. 1 wrestler in the world by Pro Wrestling Illustrated's PWI 500 list in both 2015 and 2019.
Colby Lopez was born on May 28, 1986, in Buffalo, Iowa.[1][8] He is of Armenian, German, and Irish descent.[4][9][10] His surname, Lopez, comes from his Mexican-American stepfather, who is also the father of his older brother Brandon, as seen in WWE 24.[4] He graduated from Davenport West High School in 2004.[1] As a teenager, he was an introvert and a big fan of rock and heavy metal music who lived a straight edge lifestyle.[11] Rollins trained at a wrestling school owned by Danny Daniels on the border of Chicago and Oak Park, Illinois.[4]
Lopez made his debut in 2005, wrestling in the Iowa independent scene under the ring name Gixx.[5][12] He then joined Ian Rotten's Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA) under the name Tyler Black, and entered the Ted Petty Invitational Tournament, defeating Sal Thomaselli before being eliminated by Matt Sydal in the quarterfinals in Hammond, Indiana on September 23, 2005.[13]

On May 25, 2007, while in a match with then Full Impact Pro (FIP) Tag Team Champions The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) in Melbourne, Florida, Black's tag team partner Marek Brave suffered a legitimate back injury,[16] leading Black to pursue a singles career by competing in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), where he defeated Joey Ryan in his debut on June 10.[17]
At PWG's Life During Wartime on July 6, 2008, Black teamed with Jimmy Jacobs to win the PWG World Tag Team Championship by defeating Roderick Strong and El Generico, who was a replacement for Jack Evans.[18][19] At FIP's event on December 20, Black defeated Go Shiozaki to win the FIP World Heavyweight Championship.[20] At FIP's event on May 2, 2009, Davey Richards was awarded the FIP World Heavyweight Championship by forfeit when Black was unable to compete.[20]
At the Ring of Honor (ROH) pay-per-view taping of Man Up in September 2007, Black made his debut, alongside Jimmy Jacobs and Necro Butcher, with the three attacking The Briscoe Brothers, and hanging Jay Briscoe from light rigging fashioned as a noose. The three formed a stable called The Age of the Fall.[21] The angle was so controversial that ROH decided to remove the footage from the pay-per-view that was being taped at the event.[12] Black later made his ROH in-ring debut later that night in a dark match, wrestling Jack Evans to a no contest.[12]
At Glory by Honor VI in November, Black defeated Alex "Sugarfoot" Payne, but was attacked by The Briscoe Brothers following the match.[22] He appeared with The Age of the Fall in their match against The Briscoe Brothers during the main event.[23] At Final Battle in December, Black and Jacobs defeated The Briscoe Brothers to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship.[24]

The booking saw Cornette set up a judging panel with himself on and one person picked by each competitor, in order for there to be a decisive winner in case of another draw. Aries picked Kenny King while Black picked Roderick Strong,[30] whom he guaranteed an ROH World Championship title shot should he win. At the event, Black pinned Aries to win the ROH World Championship.[31][32]

Later that night, Rollins successfully defended the Universal Championship against Strowman in the main event, but was attacked by "The Fiend" Bray Wyatt after the match.[247] At Hell in a Cell, Rollins defended his title against The Fiend in a Hell in a Cell match that ended in referee stoppage after The Fiend was buried under several weapons and hit with a sledgehammer by Rollins.[248] After that, Rollins was then made captain for Team Hogan at Crown Jewel. However, he was removed when he was then scheduled in a rematch against Wyatt for the Universal Championship in a Falls count anywhere match.[249] At the event, Rollins lost the title to The Fiend.[250]
In November, Rollins was selected as the captain for Team Raw at Survivor Series, against Team SmackDown and Team NXT.[251] At the event, Team SmackDown was victorious in the main event match.[252] The following night on Raw, Rollins berated the entire Raw roster for "dropping the ball" and failing to win at the pay-per-view. These comments later drew the attention of Kevin Owens, who attacked Rollins and challenged him to a match, which ended in a disqualification after AOP (Akam and Rezar) attacked Owens.[253][254] On the December 9 episode of Raw, despite earlier denying an alliance with AOP, Rollins joined the group in attacking Owens, turning heel for the first time since 2016.[255]
By the beginning of 2020, Rollins began proclaiming himself as the "Monday Night Messiah".[256] Throughout the next several weeks, Rollins and AOP would attack and brutalize the likes of Rey Mysterio, Samoa Joe, and Kevin Owens, with the latter receiving the worst of it until Joe and a returning Big Show came to Owens' aid.[256][257] On the January 13, 2020 episode of Raw, Rollins and AOP were assisted by Buddy Murphy in their match against Big Show, Owens and Joe, thereby adding Murphy to their faction.[258] The following week on Raw, Rollins and Murphy defeated The Viking Raiders to win the Raw Tag Team Championship, becoming a record six-time reign for Rollins individually.[259]
Part of his WWE ring name is a tribute to former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins.[260] During his time in FCW, Rollins used a superkick to a kneeling opponent called Avada Kedavra as a finisher.[261][262] When he joined The Authority, he adopted Triple H's Pedigree as his finishing maneuver.[263] In April 2017, he introduced a new finishing move, a jumping knee strike called the Ripcord Knee.[264] Rollins has known to use his current and most notable finisher, the Curb Stomp (often referred to as simply the Stomp),[265] for most of his career.[266] However, Rollins didn't use his Stomp after his title win at WrestleMania because Vince McMahon thought it was a "cruel" move for their WWE Champion.[267]
Throughout his time as a member of The Shield, before the team initially dispersed, his character was that of an "out-spoken hot-head who will do crazy things" to help The Shield.[268] After turning into a villain and aligning himself with AOP in late-2019, Rollins began to dub himself  "Monday Night Messiah" and allude himself to Jesus.[256][269]
In 2019, Rollins received attention for his social media activities and public comments.[270][271] In June, Rollins received criticism for his interaction with fellow wrestler Will Ospreay on Twitter, who Rollins referenced as "little guy" and urged to "compare bank accounts" with him; he apologized in early July, calling the tweets "garbage" and "not in line with my values".[272][273][274] He later publicly called Jon Moxley (who had performed on WWE as Dean Ambrose) "presumptuous" for criticizing WWE following his departure from the company, as well as regarding professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (where Moxley went to compete after his departure from WWE) as the "minor leagues".[275][276] In November, Rollins publicly refuted a story published by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter that claimed that he spoke during a backstage meeting prior to an episode of Raw.[277] The Wrestling Observer Newsletter later issued a retraction and an apology to Rollins.[278]
In the same year, Rollins' character notably drew criticisms from audiences, particularly after he retained the Universal Championship over "The Fiend" Bray Wyatt via referee stoppage at the Hell in a Cell event, to which the live crowd reacted negatively.[279][280][281][282][283] Bleacher Report subsequently stated that the negative reaction was a response against "a character that has become too bland, one-dimensional and unlikable for fans to continue supporting."[284] Following Rollins' heel-turn shortly after his feud with Wyatt, the New York Post hypothesized that "WWE had no choice but to turn Seth Rollins heel", even though it "doesn’t absolve WWE from blame for needing to make the switch".[285] Meanwhile, Forbes noted that after his heel-turn, "for the first time in a long time, reaction to the direction of Rollins' character has been overwhelmingly positive".[286]
Rollins is regularly featured on Xavier Woods' YouTube channel UpUpDownDown, where he goes by the nickname 'The Champ'. In August 2019, Rollins won a #1 contender's tournament to challenge Samoa Joe for the UpUpDownDown Championship. He defeated Joe in a game of Track & Field II to win the championship.[287] In October, in his first and only defense, Rollins lost the championship to Becky Lynch in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite.[288]
Lopez resides in Moline, Illinois.[289] He is an atheist[290][291] and a fan of the Chicago Bears and St. Louis Cardinals.[4]
In 2014, Lopez and his former tag team partner Marek Brave started The Black & The Brave Wrestling Academy, a professional wrestling school in Moline.[292] In February 2019, Lopez opened a coffee shop called 329 Dport in his hometown of Davenport, Iowa.[293]
On February 9, 2015, a nude photo of former NXT wrestler Zahra Schreiber, reportedly Lopez's girlfriend,[294] was posted to his social media accounts, the contents of which are automatically republished by WWE.com.[295] Soon after, nude photos of Lopez were posted on the Twitter page of his then-fiancée,[296] Leighla Schultz.[297] In response, Lopez apologized for "private photographs that were distributed without [his] consent".[298][299] On February 25, 2016, Lopez revealed that he had broken up with Schreiber, but did not say what caused the split.[300]
After months of speculation, it was confirmed on May 13, 2019, that Lopez was in a relationship with fellow WWE wrestler Rebecca Quin, better known as Becky Lynch.[301][302] WWE subsequently acknowledged the relationship on their website.[303] The couple announced their engagement on August 22, 2019.[304][305]
On September 10, 2019, Lopez found out that he had a brother and a sister after taking a DNA test.[306]
