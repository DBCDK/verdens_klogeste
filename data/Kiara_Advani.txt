Alia Advani (born 31 July 1992), known professionally as Kiara Advani,  is an Indian actress who appears predominantly in Hindi films. After making her film debut with the 2014 poorly received comedy Fugly, Advani had her first commercial success with a brief role in the 2016 sports biopic M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, followed by a starring role in the 2018 Netflix anthology film Lust Stories. She subsequently played the love interest of the male protagonists in the Telugu political drama Bharat Ane Nenu (2018), one of the highest-grossing Telugu films, and the romantic drama Kabir Singh (2019), one of the highest-grossing Indian films.
Kiara Advani was born to Jagdeep Advani, a Sindhi Hindu businessman and Genevieve Jaffrey, a teacher whose father was a Muslim from Lucknow and mother was of Scottish, Irish, Portuguese, and Spanish ancestry; and had a Bengali godmother.[3][4][5][6] Born as Alia Advani, Advani changed her first name to Kiara prior to the release of her first film, Fugly.[1] Kiara was quoted as saying that it was Salman Khan's suggestion to change her name from Alia to Kiara, as Alia (Bhatt) was already up and coming at the time.[7] In an interview to Filmfare in 2019, Kiara Advani said that the name "Kiara" was inspired from Priyanka Chopra's character of Kiara in the film Anjaana Anjaani.[8][9] The elder of two children, Advani has a younger brother, Mishaal. She is also related to several celebrities via her maternal family. Actors Ashok Kumar and Saeed Jaffrey are her step-great-grandfather and great-uncle, respectively, whereas model Shaheen Jaffrey is her aunt.[2]
Advani made her acting debut with Kabir Sadanand's comedy-drama Fugly[10] (2014), in which she featured alongside an ensemble cast including Mohit Marwah, Arfi Lamba, Vijender Singh, and Jimmy Shergill. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama said: "Kiara Advani catches you completely unaware" and has the "combination of looks and talent",[11] whereas Mehul S Thakkar of Deccan Chronicle noted her performance as being "very striking" and said she "shows a lot of promise".[12] It emerged as a commercial disappointment.[13]
Advani's next film role was in the Neeraj Pandey-directed biographical sports drama M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016)[14] (2016), about the life of MS Dhoni, an Indian cricketer who was the former captain of the Indian cricket team. Cast opposite Sushant Singh Rajput (who essayed Dhoni's character in the film), Advani played the real-life character of Sakshi, his love-interest. With gross earnings of over ₹2.16 billion (US$30 million) in worldwide ticket sales, M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story proved to be a major economic success, and was one of the highest-grossing Indian films of that year.[15] The following year, Advani appeared opposite newcomer Mustafa Burmawalla in Machine[16] (2017), an action romantic thriller from the director duo Abbas–Mustan.[17]
In 2018, Advani first appeared in the anthological drama Lust Stories,[18] a Netflix film consisting of four segments dealing with woman sexuality. She featured in Karan Johar's segment, playing Megha, a newly married wife whose husband (played by Vicky Kaushal) fails to recognise her sexual dissatisfaction.[19] She also made her debut in Telugu cinema with Koratala Siva's political thriller Bharat Ane Nenu,[20] that revolves around a student (played by Mahesh Babu) who unexpectedly becomes the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. The film had worldwide earnings of ₹2.25 billion (US$32 million), making it one of Telugu cinema's highest grossers.[21][22][23] Also that year, Advani appeared in a music album titled "Urvashi", sung by Yo Yo Honey Singh, opposite Shahid Kapoor.[24]
Boyapati Srinu's Telugu action drama Vinaya Vidheya Rama was Advani's first release of 2019. She played the role of Ram Charan's fiancée. The film met with a negative response and flopped at the box office both Indian and abroad.[25] Advani then returned to Bollywood by appearing as Lajjo, a courtesan, in Abhishek Varman's period drama Kalank,[26] which also fared poorly at the box office. Her next appearance was in Sandeep Vanga's romance Kabir Singh alongside Shahid Kapoor. An adaptation of Vanga's 2017 Telugu movie Arjun Reddy,[27] it is about the titular character (played by Kapoor) who goes on a self-destructive path and becomes an alcoholic surgeon after his lover (played by Advani) marries someone else. Despite receiving mixed reviews for glamorising misogyny and toxic masculinity,[28] Kabir Singh emerged as the second highest-grossing film of the year.[29] Her final role that year was in Raj Mehta's comedy film Good Newwz, about two couples tryst with in vitro fertilization.[30]
In 2020, Advani will reteam with Akshay Kumar in Laxmmi Bomb, a remake of Tamil film Muni 2: Kanchana,[31][32] after which she will play the title role in the coming-of-age comedy-drama Indoo Ki Jawani, opposite Aditya Seal.[33][34] She will also star opposite Kartik Aaryan and Sidharth Malhotra in a standalone sequel to the 2007 film Bhool Bhulaiyaa and a biopic of army officer Vikram Batra entitled Shershaah, respectively.[35][36]
