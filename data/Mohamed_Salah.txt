Salah started his senior career with Egyptian club El Mokawloon, departing shortly thereafter to join Swiss side Basel for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland, his performances attracted Premier League side Chelsea, who signed him for in 2014. However, he was used sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina and Roma, with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15 million. Following his role in helping Roma to a second-placed finish and a club record points-tally in 2017, Salah returned to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9 million.
In his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a forward, going on to break the Premier League scoring record for a 38-game season and subsequently receiving the Premier League Golden Boot after netting 32 goals in 36 league games. Salah's performances earned him a number of individual accolades, including the PFA Players' Player of the Year. He also came third in the 2018 Best FIFA Men's Player award.

Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year.[11] Since then, he has helped Egypt reach the final of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, and was top scorer during CAF qualification to help the team qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

His club maintained afterwards that it had been a "coincidence" and that no snub had been intended. In the return leg on 6 July played in Tel Aviv, instead of offering an open hand Salah appeared to have only offered fist bumps to the Maccabi players. He was booed by the home fans for the rest of the match, in which he scored once as Basel progressed into the next round.[219][220]
Prior to 2018 FIFA World Cup, Salah condemned the Egyptian FA unauthorised use of his image on the national team's EgyptAir plane.[221] At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, at which the Egypt national team were based in Chechnya, the autonomous republic presided by Ramzan Kadyrov, Salah posed for a photo with the Chechen leader after the latter made a visit to the team's hotel and requested a photo shoot with him at the stadium during their team training.[222] Kadyrov later gave him honorary citizenship of the Chechen Republic in a public dinner made for the whole Egypt national team and officials.[223] Several western news outlets and NGOs criticised Salah and the EFA for their interactions with Kadyrov, citing the president's alleged human rights abuses and that the player is used for 'political propaganda' by the dictator during Egypt's national team training camp in Chechnya.[224][225] Salah's relationship with the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) was reported to have soured during the World Cup, after his image was used without his permission to promote the national team's sponsor, WE, the mobile service of Telecom Egypt.[226] At the time of the incident, Salah was sponsored by WE's telecommunications rivals, Vodafone.[227]
In August 2018, Liverpool referred Salah to Merseyside police after footage was posted online which showed him allegedly using a phone while driving in traffic.[228][229][230] Salah's indiscretion was brought to light after autograph hunter Rob Wylie posted a video online apparently showing the Egyptian ignoring requests for autographs. Wylie, whose conduct had previously resulted in Liverpool instituting a policy which banned players giving autographs from their vehicles, received widespread criticism from the club's supporters and had to temporarily shut down his website.[231][232]
Liverpool fans created a chant to the tune of Dodgy's "Good Enough", saying that if Salah continued to score goals, they would convert to Islam – "If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me, if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too."[233] Salah gave his approval to the chant, and it has been cited as an example of inclusivity.[234] Salah is devout to a degree that many other well-known Muslims sports figures are not, and his charm and apolitical persona have made him a popular figure in the UK.[196] During his goal celebration, Salah lays in the prostrate position to thank god in sujud.[235] It appears in FIFA 19.[236]
Salah is nicknamed "The Pharaoh" by the press and his fans.[237][238][239] Salah was given the nickname "Egyptian King" by Liverpool supporters,[240][241] arising from a chant set to the tune of "Sit Down" by English band James.[242]
Following his goal that led Egypt to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1990, a school in Egypt was named after him.[243] Following Egypt's exit from the World Cup, Salah stayed in his home country for his pre-season holiday. In late June, his address was accidentally leaked on Facebook. After this, crowds of fans showed up at Salah's house, with Salah greeting the fans and signing autographs for some, although according to reports in Spain, police did arrive to cordon off his house.[244]
During Liverpool's pre-season tour in the U.S. an American artist named Brandan Odums created a mural in the Times Square area displaying Salah in the Egypt kit, with the player later posting an image on social media posing next to it.[245][246] In Egypt, several murals have also been created displaying Salah's likeness, including one in the capital of Cairo.[247][248]
A testament to his influence in the region and globally, Salah was featured on the cover of two major magazines in 2018: GQ Middle East (feature story titled "The Unstoppable Rise of Mo Salah")[249] and Time magazine's 2019 TIME 100 edition.[250] An advocate of women's equality in the Middle East, Salah  (in his TIME 100 entry) states, "We need to change the way we treat women in our culture".[251] English comedian, and noted Liverpool fan, John Oliver wrote Salah's feature in the TIME 100 issue.[250] Despite being named as the "GQ Middle East Man of The Year" in 2019, another GQ photoshoot, with Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio, caused him some criticism in the Islamic world.[252] In January 2020, Salah was honored with wax statue at Madame Tussauds in London. The museum announced that the statue would be unveiled later in the year. “As Egyptian Forward and currently both European and World Club champion with Liverpool FC, Mo Salah is a global star at the peak of his power. We know that fans will love seeing him at the home of celebrity, where he rightly belongs,” Steve Davies, General Manager at Madame Tussauds in London said.[253]
