Selena Marie Gomez was born in Grand Prairie, Texas on July 22, 1992[2] to Ricardo Joel Gomez and former stage actress Amanda Dawn "Mandy" Cornett.[3][4][5] Gomez was named after Tejano singer and actress Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, who died in 1995.[6][7] Her father is of Mexican descent while her mother, who was adopted, has some Italian ancestry.[8][9][10] Regarding her Hispanic heritage, Gomez has stated, "My family does have Quinceañeras, and we go to the communion church. We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except [that we] go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church."[11] Gomez's parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[3][12] Selena has two younger half-sisters: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Amanda and her second husband Brian Teefey,[13][14] and Victoria "Tori" Gomez, through Ricardo and his wife Sara.[15] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[16]
When Gomez was born, her mother was sixteen years old.[17] The family had financial troubles during Gomez's childhood, with her mother struggling to provide for the pair.[18] At one point, Gomez recalled, they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car.[18] Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to purchase spaghetti for dinner.[18] Gomez stated, "I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]."[19] She later added that "[My mom] was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me."[20] Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child, and appeared in various pageants growing up.[20] Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and the pair went as far as stating that they "raised her" up until she found success in the entertainment industry.[20]
Gomez first gained an interest in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry watching her mother prepare for stage productions.[21] She began auditioning for various roles, meeting Demi Lovato during an audition for Barney & Friends.[22][23] Both Gomez and Lovato were later selected to appear on the series in 2002,[24][25] with Gomez portraying the character of Gianna.[26] The show was her first experience in acting, with Gomez recalling, "I was very shy when I was little [...] I didn't know what 'camera right' was. I didn't know what blocking was. I learned everything from Barney."[27] Gomez appeared in thirteen episodes of the show between 2002 and 2004, though the show's producers released her as she was getting "too old" for the series.[28] While working on the series, Gomez had a cameo role in the film Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) and the made-for-television film Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire (2005).[29] Gomez made a guest appearance in a 2006 episode of the Disney series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.[30]

Hoping to achieve a successful crossover into music, Gomez formed the pop-rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene through her record deal with Hollywood Records.[64] The name of the band is an "ironic jab" at the people who called Gomez a "wannabe scene".[65] The group released their debut studio album in August 2009,[66][67][68][69] which debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States, with first-week sales of 66,000 copies.[70] The album received a mixed reception, some critics praised the album for its "fun" nature, while others criticized Gomez for her vocal performance.[68][71][72] The lead single failed to have commercial success,[73] however the second single was successful.[74] With heavy promotion through Disney and performances, the song had success on radio and with sales.[75] In 2010, Gomez starred as one of the two female leads in Ramona and Beezus, a film adaption of the children's novel series by Beverly Cleary.[76][77][78] The film premiered on July 23, 2010, and it was met with generally positive reviews.[79] Selena Gomez & the Scene released their second studio album A Year Without Rain that same year,[80][81] which debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number 4 with sales of a little over 66,000.[81] The album received mixed to positive reviews where some noticed that Gomez's vocals contained the Auto-Tune effect.[82] The record's two singles both achieved moderate success.[83][84] Having previously announced plans to launch a fashion line, Gomez launched Dream Out Loud in 2010.[85][86] The collection consisted of, and featured, bohemian dresses, floral tops, jeans, skirts, jackets, scarves and hats, all of which were made from recycled or eco-friendly materials.[87][88] Gomez stated, "With my line, I really want to give the customer options on how they can put their own looks together [...] I want the pieces that can be easy to dress up or down, and the fabrics being eco-friendly and organic is super important [...] Also, the tags will all have some of my inspirational quotes on them. I'm just looking to send a good message."[85][88] To design the actual items, Gomez teamed up with designers Tony Melillo and Sandra Campos, both of whom had previously worked with big-name fashion houses.[86] Melillo and Campos teamed with New York-based Adjmi Apparel to manufacture the brand, which was formed by Adjmi CH Brands LLC, the holding company for the brand.[89]
In 2011, Gomez starred in the film Monte Carlo. Her character Grace is a teenager "mistaken for a socialite while on a trip to Paris".[90] To prepare for the role, Gomez learned how to play polo and also took two weeks of vocal training to learn two different British accents.[91][92] She also began a relationship with Justin Bieber that year, which lasted until 2014.[93] Before breaking up, they recorded an unreleased duet titled "Can't Steal Our Love".[94] Gomez appeared in a cameo role in the film The Muppets[95] and appeared in the Disney shows So Random! and PrankStars.[96] Selena Gomez & the Scene released their third and final studio album that same year.[97] The album received mixed reviews,[97] with the album's second single receiving a 4x Platinum certification from the RIAA.[98] However, the album's lead single and last single both achieved moderate success.[99][100] It was announced on July 14, 2011, that Gomez had signed a license agreement with Adrenalina, an extreme sports and adventure-themed lifestyle brand, to develop, manufacture, and distribute the actress's fragrance.
