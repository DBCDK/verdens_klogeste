Scodelario was born Kaya Rose Humphrey in Haywards Heath, England. Her mother, Katia Scodelario, is a Brazilian from Itu, São Paulo,[2] who moved to England in 1990; Scodelario's surname comes from her mother's Italian grandfather.[3] Her father, Roger Humphrey (died 22 November 2010),[4] was British.[5][6][7] Scodelario's parents divorced when she was a child and she was raised in London by her mother, subsequently adopting her surname and becoming fluent in Portuguese.[8]
In 2007, at the age of 14 and with no acting experience, Scodelario was cast in the first series of Skins as Effy Stonem. At the auditions, Scodelario became discouraged as she felt she was too young, but a producer told her to stay and she was asked to read for the part.[9] While Scodelario's role in the first series had minimal speaking lines, her character developed considerably during 2008. She eventually became the central character in the 2009 and 2010 series after the cast had been replaced with a new generation of characters. This made Effy one of the only characters to appear from series 1 all the way through to series 4. Filming began in July and Scodelario said that 18 November 2009 was her last day of filming the series and that she would miss being on the show.[10]
