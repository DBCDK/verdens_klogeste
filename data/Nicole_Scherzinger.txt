Nicole Prescovia Elikolani Valiente was born in Honolulu, on the island of Oahu, Hawai'i, into a Catholic family on June 29, 1978.[4] Her father, Alfonso Valiente, is of Filipino descent,[5] while her mother, Rosemary Elikolani, has Native Hawaiian and Ukrainian ancestry.[6] Scherzinger's parents separated when she was still a baby. When she was six years old, her maternal family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, with her sister, Keala, and her German American stepfather, Gary Scherzinger.[7][8] She took her stepfather's surname after he adopted her.
In 2007, she was inducted to DuPont Manual Alumni's Hall of Fame as one of the youngest inductees.[9] Since 2013, Scherzinger endowed her alma mater with a  yearly $2,000, namesake scholarship.[10]
After earning her own scholarship, she furthered her studies at Wright State University majoring in theater arts with a dance minor.[9] During this period, Scherzinger garnered the lead roles in regional productions of the musicals Chicago, Guys and Dolls and Show Boat.[11] In 2018, Scherzinger received the 2017 Alumna of the Year Award from the Wright State Alumni Association.[12]
In 1999, Scherzinger was hired by Days of the New band leader Travis Meeks to contribute vocals on their self-titled second studio album and later dropped out of college to tour through the US in support of the album.[13] Meeks claims that after touring, the two grew apart creatively and that despite being an "amazing entertainer", she "just didn't seem to understand music very well … she's just not much of a musician, nor [does she] understand music."[14]
Two years later, after her mother's suggestion, Scherzinger quit the band in order to audition on the WB's television show Popstars.[15] With the aim to chronicle the group's formation until the recording of their debut album,[16] Warner Bros. imprint London-Sire Records signed the group to a recording contract before the band was named and had finalized its membership, due to the hours of network television exposure the group would receive.[17] Initially hesitant at the idea of joining a group, she then opted otherwise as she saw it as an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles.[15] For her audition she sang Whitney Houston’s version of Dolly Parton's song "I Will Always Love You" and alongside Ana Maria Lombo, Maile Misajon, Ivette Sosa, and Rosanna Tavarez, established the girl group Eden's Crush.[18] Their debut single, "Get Over Yourself", was released in March 2001 and debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the first female act to debut at number one on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart.[19] Their debut studio album, Popstars (2001), debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.[20] They went on to tour with 'N Sync and Jessica Simpson, but, by the end of the year, their label went bankrupt and the group disbanded.[21] During this time, she auditioned for fourth singer of The Black Eyed Peas, but Fergie was chosen.[22] In December 2002, Scherzinger worked with Yoshiki of Japanese heavy metal band X Japan on his Violet UK project.
In August 2003, opting for a solo recording contract, Scherzinger travelled to Arista Records office in New York with a demo CD, under her Hawaiian family name, Nicole Kea, of her own written material. Her performance was interrupted by a citywide blackout, and she was forced to leave. She also did a brief detour into acting which includes a cameo in the independent comedy Love Don't Cost a Thing.[23] Meanwhile, Robin Antin, the creator of the burlesque troupe, the Pussycat Dolls, struck a joint venture with Interscope Records and along with record producers Jimmy Iovine and Ron Fair, launched an open audition for a separate recording group.[24] After will.i.am recommended Scherzinger to Iovine,[22] and in hopes to obtain a solo deal, she successfully auditioned in December 2003 along with Melody Thornton joining Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta and Kimberly Wyatt.[23][25] As the lead singer, Scherzinger assumed the majority of the vocals and is the only member of the group to have songwriting credits on their debut album, PCD which was released in September 2005.[25] The album was preceded by "Don't Cha" which became their international breakthrough, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[26] The album spawned other number-one hits, "Stickwitu" and "Buttons", the latter of which was nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.[27]
In February 2006, Scherzinger signed a global publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group, which would cover her future songwriting.[28] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she continued to work on her own music. Scherzinger's first solo recording was a feature on Avant's "Lie About Us" that was released in July 2006 and later collaborated with Diddy on "Come to Me" which became Scherzinger's first solo top-ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100.[29] In March 2007, Scherzinger announced that her debut studio album would be titled Her Name is Nicole and was initially scheduled for a release in late summer.[25][30] Four singles were released from the project—"Whatever U Like" featuring T.I., "Baby Love" featuring will.i.am, "Supervillain", and "Puakenikeni"—however, all failed to make any significant impact on the Billboard charts,[25] although "Baby Love" was a moderate success in international territories. After a number of push backs,[23] Scherzinger decided not to release any further singles from the album and at her request, Her Name Is Nicole was eventually shelved and shifted back her focus on the Doll's second album.[31][32]
The Pussycat Dolls' second and final album, Doll Domination was released in the United States on September 23, 2008 and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200.[33] The album included singles "When I Grow Up" and "I Hate This Part" which peaked at number nine and eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively.[34] Both songs were originally recorded for Scherzinger's solo effort.[35] The following year, the group embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Doll Domination Tour which began on January 18, 2009.[36] While on tour, Scherzinger was asked to re-write pop version of "Jai Ho" from the film Slumdog Millionaire (2008).[37] The song was entitled "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)" crediting A. R. Rahman and the Pussycat Dolls while Scherzinger was credited as a featured artist causing dissatisfaction within the group.[38] The song reached number one in 17 countries; in the US, it peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100, after charging eighty-five places consequently making the largest weekly leap from number 100.[39] On April 5, 2009, Scherzinger performed "America the Beautiful" at Wrestlemania XXV, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.[40] After the tour concluded in August 2009, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[41] In December 2009, Scherzinger was announced as the third judge joining Ben Folds and Boyz II Men band member Shawn Stockman on the first season of The Sing-Off.[42] She returned for the second season before being replaced by Sara Bareilles.[43]
In April 2010, she teamed up with clothing store C&A to launch her own collection of lingerie, shoes, handbags and jewellery at their stores in Brazil.[44] In May 2010, Scherzinger and her dance partner Derek Hough won the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars.[45] In August 2010, Scherzinger portrayed Maureen in the Hollywood Bowl production of the rock musical Rent, directed by Neil Patrick Harris.[46] Her performance in the musical received praise from critics,[47] Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times stated that "Scherzinger's powerhouse voice was meant for venues like the Bowl."[48] Meanwhile, following the departure of the four members, Scherzinger announced that she departed the Pussycat Dolls to focus on her solo career.[49]
Her debut studio album, Killer Love, was released on March 21, 2011 in the United Kingdom. The album experienced moderate success in certain territories; on the UK Albums Chart the album debuted and peaked at number eight and by November it sold 140,000 copies.[50] The album's second single, "Don't Hold Your Breath" became Scherzinger's first number-one single as a solo artist in the UK Singles Chart and singles, "Poison" and "Right There" both reached number three.[51] The latter one was remixed featuring 50 Cent and released as the lead single for the US version of Killer Love;[52] however the release was never materialized.[50] It peaked at number thirty-nine, remaining her highest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 as a lead artist.[53] "Right There" also peaked inside the top ten in Australia.[54] Originally hired to co-host along with Steve Jones the first season of The X Factor US,[55] Scherzinger would later replace Cheryl Cole on the judging panel.[56] She later received further backlash and death threats after sending the result to deadlock in the quarter-final which resulted in Rachel Crow's elimination.[57] She mentored the Over 30s; her final act, Josh Krajcik, was named the runner-up of the season.[58] In December 2011, as part of the 25th anniversary of The Phantom of the Opera, Scherzinger performed the song of the same name at the Royal Variety Performance.[59] Meanwhile, Killer Love was re-released with four additional songs, including the fifth and final single, "Try with Me".[60] She embarked on her first headlining tour in February 2012.[61]

On June 30, 2015, Scherzinger was crowned as the winner of the variety show I Can Do That where six celebrities compete with each other by performing skills that they never knew they had.[79] In July she performed the American national anthem at the A Capitol Fourth concert in Washington, D.C. and during the opening of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.[80][81] Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris, a live variety show premiered on September 15, 2015 on NBC with Scherzinger as co-host; the show was cancelled after one season due to low ratings.[82] The following month, the music panel show hosted by Ricky Wilson, Bring the Noise premiered on Sky 1 with Scherzinger and Tinie Tempah joining him as team captains.[82] After a 3-year break from The X Factor, Scherzinger returned as a judge for the thirteenth and fourteenth series replacing Rita Ora; for Scherzinger she won the thirteenth series with her contestant Matt Terry who also was in the bottom two in the semi-final.[83][84] She voiced Sina in the animated feature Moana, which was released in November 2016 through Walt Disney Pictures.[85] Scherzinger starred as Penny in ABC's television film Dirty Dancing, a remake of the 1987 film of the same name.[86] It premiered on May 24, 2017.[87] Although the movie received negative reviews from critics, Scherzinger's performance received praise.[88] In September 2017, she launched her debut fragrance, Chosen by Nicole Scherzinger.[89] In 2018, Scherzinger had a voice cameo in Ralph Breaks the Internet.[90]
In January 2019, Scherzinger began appearing as a panelist on the reality competition series The Masked Singer, judging both season 1 and season 2.[91] In April 2019, Scherzinger joined Australia's Got Talent as judge for its ninth season.[92] In October 2019, she returned to the UK to judge the 2019 celebrity version of The X Factor.[93]

Scherzinger names Whitney Houston as her major musical influence stating, "I always wanted to be Whitney Houston growing up."[98] After receiving a cassette of Whitney Houston's self-titled debut album (1985) at the age of six, she claims that Houston showed her singing was her destiny.[99] As she grew older she also listened to artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade, Alanis Morissette, and Tina Turner.[98] While on stage Scherzinger borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger; "the way he prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love [Turner's] attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you."[98] She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to "wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself."[100] Scherzinger stated that Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope (1997) influenced the recording process of her second album, Big Fat Lie, while its lead single's music video was inspired by Jackson's  Love Will Never Do (Without You) (1989) clip.[101]
When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music.[102] Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele.[103] Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens.[104] Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols.[104] When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film.[105] She said, "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said."[105] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.[105] Stylistically, Scherzinger draws inspiration from Jennifer Lopez, Sienna Miller, and Gwen Stefani.[106] During her twenties, Scherzinger tried to emulate Lopez by dying her hair blonde.[107]
Scherzinger possesses a wide vocal range. Her music is generally R&B,[108][109] and dance-pop in some of her songs, especially on her album Killer Love.[110] Though Scherzinger releases English language songs, she recorded Hindi lyrics for the Pussycat Dolls' version of "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)".[111] She has received co-writing credits for multiple songs she recorded.[112] Her early songs were female-empowerment themed compositions like "I Don't Need a Man" and "Hush Hush" and transitioned to more mature "break-up" anthems such as "Don't Hold Your Breath".[113] Scherzinger has also received co-writing credits for some of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. She has also been involved in the vocal arrangement and vocal production of a few songs she's written.[114]
Scherzinger's songs are written from personal experiences, as she said they are "personal and heartfelt" tracks.[115] She co-wrote the majority of her first studio album, Killer Love.[113] Scherzinger's earlier songs have been described as "sexual innuendo"[116] and "funky electronica"[117] which are also backed by "electro beats".[118] In August 2010, RedOne revealed that he was working on Scherzinger's debut album, stating: "I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it wasn't consistent. Her new record – it's the real her."[119] Scherzinger said a lot of her first studio album was about her split with Lewis Hamilton before they reunited.[120] Scherzinger said that she wanted to create songs which "lend themselves to live performances".[121] She said she likes to record "empowering" ballads.[122] She said that she wanted her debut album to be "in your face and strong".[123] She told MTV (about her unreleased debut album Her Name is Nicole) "I've always said that in the Pussycat Dolls, I kind of feel like Superwoman. But that's just one of my alter egos. I've got the vulnerable, lovesick side of me amongst others which all appear on my record."[124]
Described as being "provocative" when performing on stage, Scherzinger states that her stage persona "comes from a strong place, not a weak place, and there’s a big difference. There’s a big difference when you see someone who still has class and is empowering."[15] Jarett Wieselman of The New York Post placed her at number two on his list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers,[125] while Rolling Stone magazine readers voted Scherzinger as the ninth Favorite Dancing Musician.[126]
Scherzinger initially rose to fame as a teen idol alongside her colleagues in the short-lived girl group Eden's Crush.[127] The Pussycat Dolls's founder Robin Antin recalls that when Scherzinger first walked in for her audition to join the burlesque troupe, the outfit she donned was way "too conservative" for the group.[128] Scherzinger later admitted she cried when she saw the first and "revealing" outfit she would have to wear as a member of the band, as she was dealing with body image issues at the time.[129] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly took a major swipe at Scherzinger for her role as lead singer. Watson said, "there are two kinds of girl groups: those anchored by a superstar (the Supremes, Destiny's Child), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts (Spice Girls, TLC). The Pussycat Dolls are neither – they're a brand, not a band. [...] 2005's multi-platinum PCD finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no Beyoncé."[130] Scherzinger has claimed that she was responsible for both lead and backing vocals on the group's songs, with hardly anything sung by the other members.[131] She commented, "...people don't even know the story. I was in the center because I was singing. I was the one singing."[132]
Scherzinger is also a vocal supporter of gay rights and became a gay icon.[133] Scherzinger's popularity within the gay community increased due to her work with the Pussycat Dolls.[108] One of the songs written by Scherzinger, "I Don't Need a Man", was dedicated to all of her gay fans.[108] She explained: "Whoever I could inspire, I wanted to inspire them. It's about the messages of empowerment and loving yourself for who you are."[108] Scherzinger is also very vocal when it comes to bullying.[134] She believes in acceptance and recalls receiving knock backs and the message of her music releases show how she dealt with them.[135] In 2017, for Gay Pride Month, Billboard asked numerous pop culture luminaries to write 'love letters' to the LGBTQ community, one of whom was Scherzinger. In her letter she expressed her admiration "When I think of the LGBTQ community, I think of a community standing strong against adversity and a community that unites for change."[136]
She admits it is "frustrating" to read about the media's portrayal of her as "a man-eater".[137] Scherzinger has been linked to a number of different men, but insists none of the rumors are true.[137] In July 2013, Scherzinger posed semi-nude for a "Protect the Skin You're In" T-shirt, part of a campaign by fashion designer Marc Jacobs to raise awareness and cash for melanoma research.[138] All sales benefit the NYU Cancer Institute and NYU Langone Medical Center.[139] The outfits she wore as a Pussycat Doll and sexual dance moves they performed has continued ever since she embarked on her solo career.[140] Scherzinger said: "I think I am able to handle myself in a good manner and hopefully I'm a positive role model for other girls out there."[141] Scherzinger also wore the first Twitter dress at the EE launch party.[142]
Scherzinger has developed an image as a sex symbol and "one of the hottest women on the planet."[143] Since 2006 has been featured on FHM's "100 Sexiest Women" list peaking at number nine in 2011 and 2014.[144] In 2012, VH1 ranked her the eight on their list of "100 Sexiest Artists",[145] while Complex magazine ranked her the twenty-ninth on their list of "The 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time".[146]
Described as the "driving force" behind The Pussycat Dolls, Scherzinger is credited for the result of the group's international success in the music industry, during a time when girl groups were grossly underrepresented.[147][148] With only two studio albums, the band became the best-selling girl group of the past decade,[149] digital era,[150] and fourth of all time.[151] Since beginning her career with the group in 2003, Scherzinger has sold 54 million records worldwide,[152][153] and another 16 million as a solo artist.[2] Scherzinger has been given several pop culture titles, including, "Pop Princess"[154] and the "Hawaiian Pop Goddess"[155] becoming an international pop culture icon following her debut.[156]
Scherzinger's television and music video impact has also been acknowledged in pop culture where she is known for her music videos, which often incorporate raunchy outfits and dance breaks. Critics generally favor Scherzinger's intricate choreography.[157] She is considered a sex symbol through her music videos.[158] Simon Cowell praised Scherzinger's performance ability, respectively calling her "one of the best live performers I've ever seen" and "if you want an example of how you do it right... its Nicole. It's focus, performance, vocals...".[159] American recording artist Lady Gaga has been influenced by Scherzinger's role in the Pussycat Dolls saying, "There's something that's very humbling about being able to work with a powerhouse group like that. Probably the biggest influence they've had on me is making me want to be a better writer."[160]
Scherzinger has received many accolades throughout her career. In February 2013, Scherzinger was honored by the Harvard Foundation as "2013 Artist of the Year" for her contributions in performing arts, support for breast cancer research and initiatives for adults and children with special needs.[161] In April 2013, she was awarded with the "Outstanding Achievement in Music Award" at the Asian Awards for "inspiring achievements in the fields of business, sport, entertainment, philanthropy and popular arts and culture".[162] She has been hailed as one of the sexiest artists.[163] In 2013, Fuse included Scherzinger on the list of 50 Girls Who Run the World,[164] and the Top 100 Pop Breakthroughs.[165]
Scherzinger's early years in the Pussycat Dolls were marred with difficulties. During her first photo shoot with the group, she was required to wear nothing more than a bra, underwear and garters; uncomfortable with her own body she started to suffer from bulimia.[129] In order to overcome her struggle with bulimia, she saw therapists and life coaches and recorded a PSA for the website Half of Us to raise awareness about the eating disorder.[13][166] The eating disorder lasted for eight years, remarking that it would have destroyed her life.  
I had started losing my voice, I couldn’t sing at shows, and then I remember my manager finding me passed out on the floor in Malta or in the south of France. I thought, ‘I’m going to lose everything I love if I don’t love myself.’ One day when you feel like you’ve reached the end, you just say, ‘I’m not doing this anymore.’ It’s sad to see how I wasted my life. I had such a great life on the outside, the Dolls were on top of the world but I was miserable on the inside. I’m never letting that happen again; you only get one life – I was 27 only once.
Scherzinger was engaged to Nick Hexum, lead singer of 311, whom she dated from 2000 to 2004.[168] Scherzinger commenced a high-profile relationship with future Formula 1 World Champion Lewis Hamilton after they met at the 2007 MTV Europe Music Awards in Munich.[169] Their on and off relationship of seven years was a tabloid fixture in the British press.[170][171] They separated for the final time in February 2015.[172]
Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, along with various other artists, she was featured on the charity single "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", and participated in George Clooney's and Wyclef Jean's Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon which benefited people affected by the tragedy.[173][174] In October 2010 she portrayed Trixie at the 35th anniversary concert of The Rocky Horror Picture Show which raised money for the Painted Turtle, a Hole in the Wall Foundation camp for kids with serious medical conditions.[175] Inspired by her aunt who has Down syndrome, she became a global ambassador for the Special Olympics and recorded "O Holy Night" for A Very Special Christmas (2013)  with all proceeds benefiting the organization.[176] Since 2014 Scherzinger is an UNICEF UK supporter and has traveled to Guyana, Manila, Philippines, and Kenya, where she visited the organization's supported centers benefiting children in poverty.[177] She later performed "Brave" with the SU2C choir for Stand Up 2 Cancer to raise money for cancer research on October 17, 2014.[178]
Scherzinger along with numerous other artists were featured on the single "Love Song to the Earth", which was released in September 2015 ahead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, as part of the global campaign to raise awareness on climate change.[179] In September 2016, Scherzinger along with numerous other artists were featured on the remake of the Black Eyed Peas song "Where Is the Love?" where all proceeds went towards will.i.am's non-profit foundation, i.am.angel Foundation.[180]
