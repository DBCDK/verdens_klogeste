Randal Keith Orton (born April 1, 1980) is an American professional wrestler and actor. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand.[1][4][5]
Orton is a third-generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Bob Orton, father Bob Orton Jr., and uncle Barry Orton were all professional wrestlers.[4][6] Before being promoted to the main World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) roster, he trained in and wrestled for Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling for a month. He was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he held the OVW Hardcore Championship twice.[7]
Orton became a member of the stable Evolution shortly after his WWE debut, which quickly led to an Intercontinental Championship reign, his first title with the company.[8] He also acquired the moniker "The Legend Killer" during a storyline where he began disrespecting and then physically attacking WWE Hall of Famers and wrestling veterans.[1] At age 24, he became the youngest world champion in WWE history after he won the World Heavyweight Championship from Chris Benoit.[9][10] With this win, he departed from Evolution and a feud with his former stablemates began. In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO. Together, they held the World Tag Team Championship.[11] After Rated-RKO disbanded in mid-2007, Orton gained two WWE Championship reigns in one night, becoming the second youngest two-time WWE Champion at the age of 27.[12][13] He formed the group The Legacy with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr. in 2008. They disbanded in 2010, and Orton returned to singles competition. From 2013 to 2015, he was aligned with The Authority, who named him the "face of the WWE". In 2016, he joined The Wyatt Family, winning the SmackDown Tag Team Championship with stablemates Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper before turning on them in 2017. He won his first United States Championship in 2018, becoming the 18th overall Grand Slam Champion after already having been the 17th Triple Crown Champion.
Orton has held the WWE Championship[a] nine times and WWE's World Heavyweight Championship four times. He was the final holder of the World Heavyweight Championship, which he unified with the WWE Championship to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion by defeating John Cena at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in 2013.[14] Orton is recognized by WWE as having the fourth-most world championship victories in history, behind only Cena, Ric Flair, and Triple H. He is the winner of the 2013 Money in the Bank ladder match, as well as the 2009[15] and 2017 Royal Rumble matches, and has headlined multiple WWE pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania XXV[16] and WrestleMania XXX.[17]
Randal Keith Orton was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, on April 1, 1980, the son of Elaine and professional wrestler Bob Orton Jr.[4][5] He is the grandson of professional wrestler Bob Orton and nephew of wrestler-turned-musician Barry Orton.[18] He has a younger brother named Nate, who is a stand-up comedian, and a younger sister named Rebecca.[19] Knowing the hardships of life as a professional wrestler, Orton's parents tried to convince him to stay away from the business[4] and his father warned him that life in the ring meant a life on the road and away from family.[1] Orton attended Hazelwood Central High School, where he was an amateur wrestler.[1][4] After graduating from high school in 1998,[20] he enlisted with the United States Marine Corps. At the base, he received a bad conduct discharge in 1999 after going UA on two occasions and disobeying an order from a commanding officer.[21] Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, he was tried and convicted under a special court-martial, subsequently spending 38 days in the brig at Camp Pendleton.[18][21]
Orton made his wrestling debut in 2000 at the Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling (MMWA-SICW) in St. Louis, Missouri, an offshoot of the historic St. Louis Wrestling Club headed by Sam Muchnick.[3] There, he was trained by both the staff of the promotion and his father, Bob Orton Jr.[18] He wrestled for the promotion for one month,[22] where he performed with wrestlers such as Phil e. Blunt and Ace Strange and Mark Bland.[3][22] Orton also refereed a few matches with World Organized Wrestling (WOW), a promotion where his uncle Barry Orton worked.[2]
In 2001, Orton signed a deal with the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was sent to its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training. During his time in OVW, Orton wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed with Bobby Eaton during a tag team title tournament. He won the OVW Hardcore Championship twice by defeating Mr. Black on February 14, 2001, and Flash Flanagan on May 5, 2001, respectively.[7] On several occasions he faced Rico Constantino on combined WWF/OVW events, and also lost to The Prototype (John Cena) in a tag match on July 28 in Jacksonville, Indiana. He also began appearing on several WWF house shows that were unaffiliated with OVW, the first being on May 1, 2001 when he faced Billy Gunn. After taking the mic and promising to beat Gunn, Orton was defeated.[23] That fall he began appearing regularly on WWF house shows and dark matches, facing Chuck Palumbo, Steven Richards and Shawn Stasiak, but mostly wrestling in tag team matches.
One of Orton's first official WWF appearances was March 16, 2002 at WrestleMania X8's Fan Axxess, where he was defeated by Tommy Dreamer. Orton's first televised WWF match was a victory against Hardcore Holly on SmackDown! on April 25, 2002.[24] Soon after, Orton became a fan favorite and was placed in a series of matches with Holly.[25][unreliable source?][26][unreliable source?][27][unreliable source?][28][unreliable source?] In September 2002, Orton was drafted to the Raw brand, where he defeated Stevie Richards in his debut on the show.[29][unreliable source?][30] Within weeks of his debut on the Raw brand, Orton suffered a shoulder injury,[31][unreliable source?] leaving him sidelined for months.[32][33][unreliable source?] While recovering, Orton still appeared on Raw in his own Randy News Network (RNN) segment, a weekly vignette featuring him talking about his condition.[32][34][unreliable source?] The show interrupted other segments of Raw programming, which caused Orton to slowly transition himself into a narcissistic and self-centered villain.[35]
After his injury healed, Orton joined the Evolution stable, which consisted of Ric Flair, Triple H and relative newcomer, Batista. The group was pushed on Raw from 2003 to 2004, with the height of their dominance occurring after Armageddon in 2003 when all of the men's titles on Raw were held by the members of Evolution.[36] In 2003, Orton spent much of his time helping Triple H overcome challenges for the World Heavyweight Championship.[37][38][39] Orton joined Triple H in an Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, involved primarily to secure Triple H's title defense, and was eliminated by Goldberg, but the stable managed to fulfill its purpose and Triple H went on to eliminate Goldberg and thus retain his title.[40]
Afterwards, Orton proclaimed himself "The Legend Killer", a young upstart who was so talented that he touted himself as the future of professional wrestling. He embarked on numerous storyline feuds with "legendary" wrestlers and gained infamy for his blatant disrespect of many older, well-respected names in wrestling history. With the help of his stablemate and mentor Ric Flair, he defeated Shawn Michaels at Unforgiven in the first of many high-profile matches billed as "Legend versus Legend Killer."[41] During this time, Orton began using the move that would become his signature finisher, the RKO, a jumping cutter named after his initials.[42] Orton soon defeated Rob Van Dam for the Intercontinental Championship at Armageddon on December 14, 2003.[43] With this win, Orton started the longest Intercontinental Championship reign in seven years, holding the title for seven months.[44] Orton continued to establish himself as a "Legend Killer" throughout 2004, challenging the semi-retired wrestler Mick Foley. Famed for his brutal hardcore matches and ability to handle excruciating pain, Foley challenged Orton to a hardcore "Legend versus Legend Killer" match for his Intercontinental Championship, which Orton reluctantly accepted. At Backlash, Orton defeated Foley in a hardcore match to retain the Intercontinental Championship.[45] Orton then spat in the face of Harley Race on the April 26 episode of Raw.[46][47][unreliable source?] Two months later at Bad Blood, he retained the Intercontinental Championship against Shelton Benjamin. In July, at Vengeance, Orton lost the  title to Edge, ending Orton's 210-day title reign.[48]
After losing the Intercontinental Championship, Orton became the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship after winning a 20-man battle royal on July 26.[49][unreliable source?] At SummerSlam, Orton defeated Chris Benoit for the championship, thus becoming the youngest world champion in WWE history at the age of 24.[50] Benoit congratulated Orton after the match, shaking his hand for showing the ability to "be a man".[51] The following night on Raw, after Orton successfully defended the title against Benoit in a rematch, Evolution threw Orton a mock celebration only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton propped on his shoulders in elation, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs-up and then abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down, which was followed by Batista dropping Orton to the mat.[52][unreliable source?] Triple H, Flair and Batista attacked Orton in the ring, resulting in Orton being kicked out of Evolution. The following week, he called out Orton and ordered him to hand over the championship, but he refused, spitting in Triple H's face and hitting him with the title belt.[53][unreliable source?] Orton's breakup with Evolution began a new storyline for him as a fan favorite when he continued to feud with his former stablemates.[53][54] A month later, Orton lost his championship to Triple H at Unforgiven after interference from Flair, Batista, and Jonathan Coachman.[55] Seeking revenge, Orton lashed out at his former Evolution members, catching them by surprise during a show by giving them a large cake as a make-up gift, which he came out of nowhere to beat and humiliate the group.[56][unreliable source?] At Taboo Tuesday, Orton defeated Ric Flair in a steel cage match. After this, Orton experienced another push, becoming general manager of the Raw brand for a week following a match stipulation at Survivor Series where he picked up the win for his team by last eliminating Triple H in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match.[57] He continued to feud with Triple H, using his authority to place his opponents at severe disadvantages during title defenses.[58][unreliable source?] In January 2005 at New Year's Revolution, Orton participated in an Elimination Chamber match for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, where he was the last man eliminated by Triple H after interference from Ric Flair and Batista.[59] On the January 10 episode of Raw, Orton defeated Batista to earn a match against Triple H at the Royal Rumble for the World Heavyweight title, which he lost.[60][unreliable source?]
Orton began an on-screen relationship with Stacy Keibler and briefly feuded with Christian in February 2005.[61][unreliable source?] On the February 28 Raw, Superstar Billy Graham made an appearance, in which he advised Orton to "go where no wrestler [had] gone before".[62][unreliable source?]
Orton then produced a copy of SmackDown magazine, which featured The Undertaker on the cover.[63][unreliable source?] Heeding Graham's advice, Orton said he would set himself apart from all other wrestlers by ending The Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania.[64][unreliable source?] Throughout March 2005, Orton taunted The Undertaker, claiming he was unafraid of him. On the March 21 Raw, Orton turned into a villain once more after he delivered an RKO to his unsuspecting on-screen girlfriend, Stacy Keibler, knocking her unconscious.[65] During Orton's promos, he ran for cover whenever signs of The Undertaker's appearance (lightning, darkness, or smoke) occurred.[66][unreliable source?] When legendary wrestler Jake Roberts advised Orton not to underestimate The Undertaker, Orton performed an RKO on Roberts as well.[67][unreliable source?] In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, Orton became more defiant and unafraid of The Undertaker, taunting and assaulting him in the ring following distractions from his father, "Cowboy" Bob Orton. At WrestleMania 21, Orton lost the heavily hyped match.[68]
The next night on Raw, Orton faced Batista, who had become World Heavyweight Champion. Orton stated on-screen that his match with The Undertaker had aggravated a shoulder injury.[69][unreliable source?][70] While sidelined, Orton appeared on Raw and claimed that he was ineligible for the WWE Draft Lottery due to his injury. He was informed by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon that he was indeed a candidate for the draft, leaving a possibility of a return to SmackDown![71][unreliable source?] Orton returned to WWE programming for SmackDown! on June 16, announcing that he was the second pick in the 2005 draft lottery.[72][unreliable source?] He rekindled his feud with The Undertaker, defeating him at SummerSlam following a distraction from his father.[73] Two months later at No Mercy, Orton and his father Bob Orton defeated The Undertaker in a handicap casket match and after the match, Randy Orton and his father Bob locked the Undertaker in the casket and, in a move similar to Kane at the 1998 Royal Rumble, chopped holes in the top of the casket with an axe, poured gasoline over the casket and set it ablaze, kayfabe killing The Undertaker.[74] The following month, Orton replaced the late Eddie Guerrero as a participant in the annual elimination match of Team SmackDown against Team Raw at Survivor Series, after having lost a qualifying match to Rey Mysterio. In the match, Orton was the last remaining wrestler in the match for the third straight year, as he pinned Shawn Michaels to get the victory for Team SmackDown.[75] At the event, The Undertaker returned by emerging from a flaming casket and attacked the SmackDown superstars who came to the ring to celebrate Team SmackDown's victory.[75] On the SmackDown! episode after Survivor Series, The Undertaker interfered in a match between Rey Mysterio and Big Show after Kane interfered. Randy Orton RKO'd the Undertaker, he then struck the Undertaker with a tire iron and set him on the back of the lowrider Mysterio had driven to the ring, he then reversed the lowrider into the SmackDown set, causing an explosion.[76][unreliable source?] The feud was finally settled with a Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon.[77][unreliable source?] On December 16, The Undertaker entered the ring to deliver a promo while one of his druids appeared to be standing in the ring. The Undertaker sustained an RKO from Orton in a surprise attack. The druid revealed himself to be Orton's father, who gave Orton The Undertaker's urn, which according to the storyline allowed whomever held it to control The Undertaker.[78][unreliable source?] The Undertaker, however, beat Orton in the Hell in a Cell match, ending their nine-month-long feud.[79]
After Armageddon, Orton entered the 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, but he was eliminated by the eventual winner of the match Rey Mysterio, who earned a world championship at WrestleMania 22.[79] Orton challenged him to a match for his title shot at No Way Out.[80] In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, in an attempt to gain villain heat.[81] Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005.[82][unreliable source?][83][unreliable source?][84][unreliable source?] Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22.[85] SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio and then-champion Kurt Angle.[86][unreliable source?] On April 2 at the event, however, Orton lost after he was pinned by Mysterio. On the following episode of SmackDown, Orton challenged Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship,  but failed to win the title.[87]
On April 4, Orton was suspended for sixty days for "unprofessional conduct".[88] In an interview, Orton stated, "my conduct was unbecoming of a champion, which is what I will be again when I return".[89] To cover for the suspension, a scripted injury was devised, where Kurt Angle broke Orton's ankle during a grudge match.[90] Orton returned from his suspension in June to the Raw brand,[91][unreliable source?][92][unreliable source?] where he entered a rivalry with Angle, culminating in matches at One Night Stand and Vengeance before engaging in a storyline feud with Hulk Hogan. Orton began cutting promos insulting the aging Hogan and flirted with Hogan's then-eighteen-year-old daughter Brooke.[93][unreliable source?][94][unreliable source?] At SummerSlam, the two met in a "Legend vs. Legend Killer" match, which Hogan won.[95][96]
After the newly reformed D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) cost Edge the WWE Championship, Edge approached Orton and asked him to join forces to defeat the team. Orton, whose championship reign had been ended by Triple H in 2004, agreed, forming the tag team Rated-RKO. The two became the first to defeat DX since their reunion and quickly dominated the Raw brand's tag team division to become World Tag Team Champions.[97][98] As part of the angle, Rated-RKO attacked Ric Flair with steel chairs to enrage DX on November 27.[99][unreliable source?] At New Year's Revolution, Rated-RKO faced DX for the titles, but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match.[100] With Triple H out of action, Rated-RKO continued their on-screen rivalry with Michaels. At the Royal Rumble, both men competed in the eponymous match and made it to the final four, but both were eliminated by Michaels. Michaels later teamed with WWE Champion John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO to win the World Tag Team Championship the following night on Raw.[101] After losing the tag team titles, both Edge and Orton focused on the WWE Championship, causing friction between them. On the February 5, 2007 episode of Raw, they lost a triple threat match against Michaels to earn a WWE title match at WrestleMania 23. They both competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at the same event, but the match was won by Mr. Kennedy. On the April 9 episode of Raw, Orton and Michaels wrestled to a no contest in a number one contender's match for the WWE Championship after both men's shoulders were down during the pinfall. Finally, Orton and Edge faced off in a fatal four-way match for the title against Cena and Michaels at Backlash, however Cena retained the title after pinning Orton. On the April 30 episode of Raw, they competed against each other in a singles match, which Edge won.[102] Their alliance was effectively ended once Edge was drafted to SmackDown. Orton then continued his "Legend Killer" persona, attacking Shawn Michaels by using frequent attacks to the head, including an elevated DDT and a running punt to the face. Orton defeated Michaels at Judgment Day via knockout when Michaels suffered a kayfabe concussion and collapsed during the match.[96] Orton continued his attacks when he engaged himself in feuds with Rob Van Dam,[103] Ric Flair,[104][unreliable source?] Dusty Rhodes,[105][unreliable source?] and Sgt. Slaughter.[106][unreliable source?] During this time the commentators noted how Orton slithers around and stalks his victims like a snake; this led to "The Viper" becoming a nickname for Orton.
On the July 23 Raw, Orton was named number one contender for John Cena's WWE Championship.[105] Three times before their scheduled bout at SummerSlam, Orton assaulted Cena with the RKO.[105][107][108][unreliable source?] Orton lost the title match when Cena pinned him after an FU.[109] The next night on Raw, Orton demanded a rematch, but Raw General Manager William Regal denied him. He then appealed to Mr. McMahon, who offered him the shot if he "proved himself". That night, Orton interfered in Cena's match, assaulting him before kicking his father, who was at ringside, in the head.[110] McMahon granted Orton his rematch at Unforgiven, which he won by disqualification when Cena refused to stop punching him in the corner; however, Cena retained the championship because titles cannot change hands by disqualification.[111] After the match, Cena's father, who was again at ringside, kicked Orton in the head, which led to a match the next night on Raw, in which Orton defeated Cena's father by disqualification, then hit him with an RKO while Cena was handcuffed to the ropes. Before No Mercy, Cena suffered a legit injury during a match on Raw, after which Orton attacked Cena with an RKO. After this, he adopted the nickname of "The Viper".[112] Orton then threw him outside the ring, and gave him an RKO on the broadcast table.
At the start of No Mercy, Mr. McMahon awarded Orton the WWE Championship after Cena vacated it due to injury the previous week.[113][unreliable source?] Orton lost the title to Triple H in the opening match,[114] but regained it in the Last Man Standing main event match.[115] Orton then restarted his feud with Shawn Michaels, who returned on the October 8 episode of Raw during Orton's championship coronation and superkicked him.[116] Michaels was chosen by fan voting over Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy to meet Orton for the WWE Championship at Cyber Sunday, where Orton was disqualified after low blowing Michaels, but retained the title.[117][118] They had a rematch at Survivor Series with a pre-match stipulation that if Michaels had used Sweet Chin Music, he would have lost and never had another chance at the title, while if Orton was disqualified,  he would lose the championship; Orton pinned Michaels after an RKO to retain the title.[119][120] Orton then began a feud with the returning Chris Jericho, who challenged Orton for the WWE Championship at Armageddon, but won by disqualification after interference from SmackDown color commentator John "Bradshaw" Layfield, but Orton retained the title. He then feuded with Jeff Hardy, during which he punted Hardy's brother Matt in the head and Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb off the Raw set onto Orton. He successfully defended the title against Hardy at the Royal Rumble.[121] He then restarted his feud with John Cena, who had returned from injury to win the 2008 Royal Rumble match.[121] Instead of taking his title shot at WrestleMania XXIV, as Royal Rumble winners typically do, Cena took it at No Way Out and defeated Orton, who intentionally got himself disqualified to retain the title. The following night on Raw, Cena defeated Orton in a non-title match with Triple H as the special guest referee, resulting in Cena being added to Orton's title match with Triple H at WrestleMania, making it a triple threat match.[122] At the event, Orton retained the WWE Championship against Cena and Triple H by pinning Cena after Triple H executed a Pedigree on him.[123] The next month at Backlash, Orton lost the title to Triple H in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Cena and John "Bradshaw" Layfield.[124] After failing to win it back in his rematch at Judgment Day in a steel cage match,[125] he faced Triple H for the title once more in a Last Man Standing match at One Night Stand, which he lost after Triple H countered an RKO by throwing Orton over the top rope, legitimately breaking his collarbone and putting him out of action. During this time, he gained a new entrance theme, "Voices", performed by the band Rev Theory.[126][127]
Upon being medically cleared to return to the ring, Orton was reinjured in a motorcycle accident.[128][129] He returned to Raw on September 1, criticizing all the champions, including World Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, who he berated and slapped for letting Cryme Tyme steal their belts. This inspired them to try to gain Orton's respect.[130] They achieved this at Unforgiven when, with new stablemate Manu, they assaulted World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk, forcing him to vacate his title before his scheduled defense that night.[131] Orton returned to in-ring action on the November 3 episode of Raw, losing to Punk by disqualification when DiBiase interfered, resulting in Orton punting DiBiase in the head in retaliation.[132] On the December 1 episode of Raw, Orton proposed that he, Rhodes and Manu form an alliance.[133][134][unreliable source?] The stable, called "The Legacy", debuted the next week, defeating Batista and Triple H, Orton's former Evolution stablemates, in a three-on-two handicap match.[135]
Orton began feuding with the McMahon family on the January 19, 2009 episode of Raw when he confronted both Mr. McMahon and Stephanie, claiming that he was worth more than her, and that she had become "worthless". This infuriated Mr. McMahon, who demanded that Orton apologize, or he'd terminate him on the spot. As Mr. McMahon was about to fire him, Orton attacked him and punted him in the head, leading to him being carried out of the arena on a stretcher. On January 25, Orton won the Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Triple H.[15] The next night on Raw, Orton claimed that he suffered from IED, and that he was not responsible for his actions towards Mr. McMahon, claiming that he suffered a "loss of control" because of the disorder. He also claimed that WWE knew of the condition, but did nothing, and threatened to sue WWE for that reason, and also, if Stephanie were to fire him, threatened a second lawsuit for breach of contract, due to the fact that he was legally entitled to compete at WrestleMania because he won the Royal Rumble. Though Stephanie teased firing Orton, she changed her mind and said that she had "bigger plans", leading to Shane McMahon returning to Raw and attacking Orton. This led to Orton facing Shane in a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which he won. The next night on Raw, Orton faced Shane again in an unsanctioned match, which ended in a no contest when he punted Shane in the head, thus rendering him unable to continue the match. Stephanie then ran down to the ring to tend to her brother, but Orton attacked her with an RKO. This drew Triple H into the feud, who claimed that Orton "crossed the line" when he attacked Stephanie, his real-life wife. Later, Orton claimed that everything he had done was part of a plan to get revenge on Triple H after he kicked him out of Evolution back in 2004; according to Orton, Triple H "ruined his life", so Orton was going to do the same and take everything that Triple H cared about away from him. He challenged Triple H for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXV, where he was unsuccessful.[136] He won it the next month at Backlash by pinning Triple H in a six-man tag team match between The Legacy and Triple H, Batista and Shane McMahon. At Judgment Day, Orton defended the championship against Batista, where he retained via disqualification after Rhodes and DiBiase interfered.[137] At Extreme Rules, he lost the title to Batista in a steel cage match.[138] The following night on Raw, Orton and Legacy attacked Batista and injured his arm, forcing him to vacate the title.[139] On the June 15 episode of Raw, Orton regained the title in a fatal four-way match against Big Show, Triple H and John Cena. The following week, Orton defended the WWE Championship against Triple H in a Last Man Standing match, which ended in a no-contest after both men failed to answer the referee's ten count. They faced off for the championship once more at The Bash in a Three Stages of Hell match, which Orton won after interference from Legacy.[140] At SummerSlam, he defended the title against John Cena, during which he used several underhanded tactics to retain the championship. He lost the title to Cena in an "I Quit" match at Breaking Point,[141] but regained it from Cena in a Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell.[142] At Bragging Rights, Orton again lost the championship to Cena in a one-hour Iron Man match to end the feud.[143]
Orton then began a rivalry with Kofi Kingston, whom Orton blamed for him losing the WWE Championship due to Kingston interfering in his match with Cena to chase away Rhodes and DiBiase. On the November 16 episode of Raw, Orton and Kingston engaged in a brawl that ended with Kingston putting Orton through a table in the crowd. Both men were named captains for their respective teams at Survivor Series, where Kingston's team defeated Orton's team after Orton was last eliminated by Kingston. The two traded victories over each on following episodes of Raw, leading to a match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 13, which Orton won. The next night, he competed in a tournament to crown the 2009 Superstar of the Year, defeating The Undertaker by countout in the first round after interference from Legacy to advance to the finals later that night, where he lost to Cena.[144] Orton won a triple threat match on January 11, 2010 episode of Raw, with help from Rhodes and DiBiase, for the right to challenge Sheamus at the Royal Rumble for the WWE Championship.[145] Orton lost by disqualification when Rhodes interfered, which prompted Orton to attack both Rhodes and DiBiase after the match.[146] On the February 15 episode of Raw, Orton was again disqualified in a non-title rematch when Legacy interfered.[147] Orton and DiBiase both competed in the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber, where DiBiase eliminated Orton after hitting him with a pipe Rhodes had given him.[148] The next night on the February 22 episode of Raw, during a six-man tag team match, Orton attacked them in retaliation, turning him face.[149] At WrestleMania XXVI, Orton defeated Rhodes and DiBiase in a triple threat match.[150]
After The Legacy disbanded, Orton unsuccessfully challenged Jack Swagger for the World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules in April.[151] During a number one contender's match for the WWE Championship on Raw, Orton was speared by Edge, costing him the match and setting up a bout at Over the Limit,[152] Orton separated his right shoulder during the match, which ended in a double countout.[153] At Fatal 4-Way in June, Orton competed in a fatal four-way WWE Championship match involving champion Cena, Edge, and Sheamus, who won the title after interference from The Nexus. On July 18 at Money in the Bank, Orton competed in a Money in the Bank ladder match for a WWE Championship contract, which was won by The Miz.[154] The following night on Raw, he won a number one contender's match over Edge and Chris Jericho, earning a WWE Championship match against Sheamus at SummerSlam.[155] Sheamus was disqualified for bringing a chair into the ring, giving Orton the win, but not the title.[156] Immediately afterward, Orton hit Sheamus with the chair and an RKO onto the broadcast table.
Orton defeated Sheamus, Wade Barrett, John Cena, Edge and Chris Jericho in a six-pack challenge elimination match to become WWE Champion for the sixth time at Night of Champions.[157] After successfully defending the title against Sheamus at Hell in a Cell,[158] Orton feuded with Wade Barrett, who was blackmailing Cena to help him capture the title. Orton lost to Barrett via disqualification at Bragging Rights, but retained the title. He defeated Barrett in a rematch at Survivor Series to retain the championship again after Cena, who was the special guest referee, turned on Barrett.[159][160] The next night on Raw, Orton successfully defended the title against Barrett one final time after interference from Cena, despite a pre-match assault from The Nexus. Immediately afterwards, The Miz immediately cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and quickly beat Orton to win the WWE Championship.[161] Orton received his rematch against The Miz in a tables match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, but lost after repeated interference from The Miz's protegé Alex Riley. On the January 3, 2011 episode of Raw, Orton defeated Sheamus and Wade Barrett in a steel cage match to earn another title opportunity against The Miz at the Royal Rumble, but lost again at the event after The New Nexus interfered, starting a feud between Orton and New Nexus leader CM Punk.[162]
The next month at Elimination Chamber, Orton failed to win a WWE Championship number one contender Elimination Chamber match after being the first man eliminated by Punk.[163] Over the next three weeks, Orton punted and injured all members of The New Nexus, Michael McGillicutty, David Otunga and Mason Ryan.[164][165][166] At WrestleMania XXVII, Orton defeated Punk after a mid-air RKO.[167] On the April 11 Raw, McGillicutty, Otunga and Ryan returned and cost Orton a number one contender's gauntlet match for the WWE Championship.[168] Two weeks later in the 2011 WWE draft, Orton was drafted to SmackDown and beat Punk in a Last Man Standing Match at Extreme Rules, ending his feud with The New Nexus.[169]
On the May 6 episode of SmackDown, Orton defeated Christian to win the World Heavyweight Championship for the second time.[170] At Over the Limit, Orton made his first successful title defense in a rematch against Christian.

Orton's most notable move is his finishing maneuver, the RKO, a jumping variation of a cutter.[362][363] The name is derived from his initials (Randal Keith Orton). He also previously used a punt kick, which saw him run up to an opponent on their hands and knees and kick them in the head; within a storyline, this usually caused a concussion or some other sort of severe head injury to his opponent, and was often used to write off the on-screen characters of wrestlers who were scheduled to take time off. However, the move was legitimately banned by WWE management in 2012 due to the ease of imitation by viewers and the risk of injury should the move be botched.[364][365]
During his initial years in WWE, Orton's gimmick was that of "the Legend Killer", a young and cocky talent who disrespected and usually defeated several legends. In late 2007, in the midst of his second WWE Championship reign, his character changed to a more unstable and treacherous personality. He then adopted the nicknames of "the Viper" and "the Apex Predator" due to his untrustworthy, snake-like character.[366] He has said numerous times that he prefers playing the villain as it is easier and more natural for him: "It's easy for me to go out there and be a prick on the show because it's me times ten. And even though you probably don't like me anyway, give me five minutes and I'll make you not like me more. Being a heel is fun. It comes so natural."[367][368][369]
A former Marine,[21] Orton was cast in the lead role of the action film The Marine 2 (2009), but after injuring his collarbone, he was replaced by Ted DiBiase.[370] He had a supporting role as the father of a high school bully in the comedy-drama film That's What I Am (2011).[371] Orton was set to star in the action film The Marine 3: Homefront,[372] but he was replaced by fellow wrestler The Miz[373] due to Orton's uneasy past as a Marine.[374][375] Orton later starred in the action film 12 Rounds 2: Reloaded (2013).[376] In 2015, he starred in WWE Studios film The Condemned 2. He also had a guest-starring role in the USA Network's new series Shooter that aired in December 2016. He portrayed James Richards, an ex Navy Seal and leader of a militia group, in the fifth episode of season 1, titled "Recon by Fire".[377]

On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website as part of its continuing series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. The article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Orton, who was alleged to have obtained anastrozole, clomiphene citrate, nandrolone, oxandrolone, stanozolol, and testosterone.[401] WWE simply claimed that the allegations preceded their Talent Wellness program launched in February 2006.[402]
In August 2018, Orton was under investigation for sexual harassment by WWE for allegedly exposing himself to new members of the writing staff during his early career,[403][404][405] though nothing came of the investigation.
