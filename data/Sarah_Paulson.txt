Paulson was born on December 17, 1974,[3] in Tampa, Florida, the daughter of Catharine Gordon (née Dolcater) and Douglas Lyle Paulson II.[2][4] She spent her early life living in South Tampa until her parents' divorce when she was five years old.[5] After her parents' separation, Paulson relocated with her mother and sister to Maine, then to New York City.[6] Her mother worked as a waitress, and Paulson lived in Queens and Gramercy Park, before settling in Park Slope, Brooklyn.[6] She recalled of this period: "My mom was 27 years old [when we moved]. She didn't know a single person in New York City. She got a job at Sardi's Restaurant... She was so brave to be basically a debutante in Tampa, Florida, having a cotillion and a coming out ball—and she picked up and brought her two kids to the greatest city in the world, not knowing anyone. My mom's kind of my hero that way."[6]
Throughout her childhood, Paulson spent her summers in Florida staying with her father,[5] who was an executive at a Tampa door manufacturing company.[7] She attended P.S. 29 in Brooklyn before attending Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School[8][9] and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.[5]
Paulson began working as an actress right out of high school. She appeared in the Horton Foote play Talking Pictures at the Signature Theatre, and in an episode of Law & Order in 1994. The next year Paulson appeared in the Hallmark television film Friends at Last (1995) opposite Kathleen Turner, playing the adult version of Turner's character's daughter.[10] She also starred in the short-lived television series American Gothic (also 1995), playing the ghost of a murdered woman.[11]
In 1997, Paulson made her feature film debut in the independent thriller film Levitation, playing a woman who discovers she is pregnant after an anonymous sexual encounter.[12] Leonard Klady of Variety noted that Paulson and her co-stars are "not supported by the script," concluding: "Levitation is a grim, convoluted saga of identity and belonging. An ill-fitting combination of melodrama and magic realism, the indie effort will have a decidedly difficult time in the theatrical arena."[12] She also appeared Off-Broadway in a fall 1998 production of Killer Joe.[13] She subsequently played Elisa Cronkite in The WB comedy-drama series Jack & Jill (1999).[14] The same year, she was also cast opposite Juliette Lewis and Diane Keaton in the drama The Other Sister, playing the lesbian sister of a developmentally-disabled woman in San Francisco,[15] and in a supporting part playing a hostage in the comedy Held Up, opposite Jamie Foxx.[16] The following year, she had a small supporting role in the comedy What Women Want, starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.[17]

Also in 2005, Paulson had a small role in the Joss Whedon-directed science fiction film Serenity.[23] In the 2006–07 television season, Paulson co-starred in NBC's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, playing Harriet Hayes, one of the stars of the show-within-a-show.
