For a short time Wilde's family also had a house in Guilford, Vermont. Wilde has a sister five years older and a brother nine years younger.[7]
Wilde has said that as a result of her parents' occupations, she has a "strong journalistic streak" and is "really critical and analytical." Wilde's uncles, Alexander and Patrick Cockburn, also worked as journalists; her aunt, Sarah Caudwell, was a writer; her half-cousins, Stephanie Flanders and Laura Flanders, are journalists; and her paternal grandfather, Claud Cockburn, was a novelist and journalist. Writer Christopher Hitchens served as her babysitter.[5]

Wilde made her directing debut with the high school comedy Booksmart,[34] which was released on May 24, 2019.[35] As of June 27, 2019,[update] it was rated 97% "fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes, from 271 critics' reviews.[36] The Washington Post stated, "[as the film progresses,] Wilde's filmmaking skills become more and more evident, bursting forth in a third act that builds into something beautiful and even transcendent." The Los Angeles Times wrote that it "leaves you feeling unaccountably hopeful for the state of humanity – and the state of American screen comedy too", and The Wall Street Journal noted, "Nothing funnier, smarter, quicker or more joyous has graced the big screen in a long time."[36]
Wilde next appeared in Richard Jewell in 2019, playing Atlanta-Journal Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs.[37] The film came under fire for its portrayal of Scruggs, who died in 2001. Criticism was directed at the film for depicting Scruggs as offering to trade sex with an FBI agent in return for confidential information.[38] The editor-in-chief of The Atlanta-Journal Constitution wrote in an open letter that this depicted incident was "entirely false and malicious".[39] Employees of the newspaper demanded the film have a prominent disclaimer that "some events were imagined for dramatic purposes and artistic license."[40][41] The film was accused of perpetuating a sexist trope of women journalists exchanging sex for information.[42][43] Wilde defended her role and stated that there was a sexist double standard, in that Jon Hamm's FBI agent character was not held to the same scrutiny.[44] Commentators noted that Wilde's character was based on a real person, whereas the FBI agent was an amalgamation of multiple characters from the original script.[44] They also stated that the purpose of the film was to expose and condemn the character assassination of Jewell; however, in the process, the film commits the same character assassination of Scruggs.[45] She also directed Wake Up, a short film starring Margaret Qualley.[46]
