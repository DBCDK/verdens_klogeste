Williams set up Daisy Chain Productions with  Dom Santry and Bill Milner in early 2016 to develop and produce UK-originated short films, theatrical features and high-end television drama. Stealing Silver was the company's first production.[44]
On 1 August 2018, Williams launched the beta version of a new iOS-compatible social media app called Daisie alongside Dom Santry, with whom she also founded the film production company Daisy Chain Productions. Daisie is aimed at creative people from the worlds of art, fashion, TV, film, photography, music and literature. Its aim is to bring people across industries together, help foster collaboration with other artists and provide an alternative route into creative industries. Williams said "Our main goal is to have a community of artists who are collaborating with each other, uploading their work, sharing their projects and ultimately ... help people with their own careers, rather than our own”.[45][46][47] Williams said in 2018 that Daisie's focus is on giving the power back to the creator. “Instead of [creators] having to market themselves to fit someone else’s idea of what their job would be, they can let their art speak for themselves.”[44]
In May 2019 Daisie raised  £2 million ($2.5 million) in seed funding from Founders Fund, 8VC, Kleiner Perkins, and from the newer venture capital firm Shrug Capital, set up by AngelList’s former head of marketing Niv Dror, who also separately invested. 11 days after the public launch, in May 2019, the number of users reached 100,000, most of whom were in London,  as the bulk of its marketing efforts have taken place in the startup’s home city; with 70 per cent of user base being female.[44][48]
In 2019, Williams presented a TEDx talk in Manchester on the topic "Don't strive to be famous, strive to be talented", where she discussed Daisie.[49]
