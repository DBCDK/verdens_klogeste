One of the funniest productions in the National's history."[32] The Daily Telegraph described it as "the feelgood hit of the Summer";[33] while The Independent called it a "massive hit",[34] and the Evening Standard "a surefire hit".[35]Corden made a cameo appearance in the music video for the single "Mama Do the Hump" by Rizzle Kicks, released in December 2011, which reached #2 in the charts.
