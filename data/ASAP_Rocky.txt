Rocky previewed two snippets that might make the Beauty & The Beast: Slowed Down Sessions (Chapter 1) compilation, titled "Riot Rave" and "Unicorn".[47]
On March 16, 2014, Rocky has announced that he was working on his second studio album, entitled A.L.L.A. (an acronym for At. Long. Last. A$AP)[48] which is a follow-up to his debut album, Long. Live. A$AP.[49] Upon the wake of a delay of the ASAP Mob album, L.O.R.D., Rocky subsequently collaborated with cohorts A$AP Ferg, Nast and Twelvyy on the album's third single, "Hella Hoes", which was released on June 6, 2014.[50] Nonetheless, A$AP Mob leader A$AP Yams announced on his Tumblr account that the album had been shelved.[51]

Long. Last. A$AP was executive-produced by rapper Juicy J, producer Danger Mouse, Rocky and Yams themselves.[64][65][66]
In 2014, Rocky appeared in a cameo role in the 2015 indie comedy-drama, Dope. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2015.[67] It opened in all movie theaters on June 12.[68] There at the event, Rocky explained his expressions and grief over the death of his own friend and partner; performed "Multiply" on-stage as a dedication to his loving memory, minutes before running backstage to calm down.[69]

On April 8, 2015, the rapper released a song, titled "M'$", debuted during an interview with the Red Bull Music Academy, and was released on the iTunes Store two days later,[71] however, it was announced that the song was not an official single from the album.[72] The album, however, did include a remixed version of the track that replaced Rocky's second verse with a guest verse from Lil Wayne. On May 9, Rocky unveiled the album's cover art on his official Instagram page, with the caption "AT LONG LAST...."[73] On the same day, he then released the album's alternative artwork[74] and released the album's second single, titled "Everyday" featuring Rod Stewart, Miguel and Mark Ronson (the latter of which also produced the track alongside Emile Haynie).[75][76] Rocky also announced that the release date for A.L.L.A. was updated to June 2, 2015; however, on May 25, 2015, around 6:00 PM EDT, the album leaked online, approximately one week before its expected release.[77] Subsequently, Rocky tweeted to announce that the album will be released at midnight (May 26), changing the date a week early.[78]
Upon its release, At. Long. Last. A$AP received generally positive to mixed reviews from music critics.[79] Overall, the album was supported by the release of three singles: "Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2)", "Everyday" and "L$D".

In 2004, Mayers served two weeks in Rikers Island for drug dealing, where he shared a cell with future rapper Casanova.[21]
On July 19, 2012,[31] he was arrested after his alleged participation in a brawl that took place in downtown Manhattan involving 21-year-old artist iRome.[32][114]
In July 2012, he was sued for allegedly violently attacking an innocent man after being spotted doing illegal drugs in a clothing store in New York. He was later arrested for assaulting two amateur photographers who took photos of the incident. That incident ended with a plea bargain where he pled guilty to grand larceny for trying to take their cameras.[115][116]
On August 31, 2013, Mayers allegedly slapped a woman during the Budweiser Made in America Festival. He was charged "with misdemeanor simple assault, a class two misdemeanor".[117] The case was dismissed after a witness failed to appear in court.[118] The woman later filed a lawsuit in July 2014, asserting that she still suffered certain conditions as a consequence of the alleged assault.[118] Mayers stated that he never touched the woman in question and that she "should have known that there could be trouble in place with so many people".[119] The lawsuit was settled between the two in April 2015.[120]
In 2016, Mayers was involved in a fistfight in New Zealand after refusing to let a man board the elevator he was on.[121]
In January 2019, Mayers was involved in a scuffle in Toronto. A video shows him holding a bottle while barking at a man kneeling on the ground while holding his face.[122]
In July 2019, Mayers was arrested initially for aggravated, then for simple assault in Stockholm, Sweden, after an altercation in the street against Mustafa Jafari and another person that involved Mayers and three of his entourage on June 30.[123][124][125] Jafari was beaten, kicked, and cut with broken bottles when down on the ground.[126] He suffered several cuts, requiring stitches, and a fractured rib.[127] Mayers uploaded two videos of the incident to Instagram. In the first, he and his entourage repeatedly ask two young men, including Jafari, to stop following them as the latter complains about his headphones.[128] In the other, created from footage of assorted events, Jafari's headphones break during a scuffle, and he is seen hitting Mayers' bodyguard with them. A woman is also seen in the video, accusing the two men of groping.[129][130] Both Aftonbladet and TMZ have also published videos showing part of the scuffle.[131] Mayers published an edited video on Instagram where some things had been removed. In the unedited video, a bodyguard can be seen lifting the victim as well as a voice saying "Now we gotta fuck this ..." and Mayers saying "Go somewhere, you are going to get fucked up".[132] Surveillance footage shows the initial contact where the bodyguard attacked Jafari.[133] Henrik Olsson Lilja, the defense attorney for Mayers, maintained that his client acted in self-defense after being attacked by Jafari.[134]
Following the altercation, Jafari was taken by ambulance to a hospital.[135] Mayers' bodyguard filed a counter-complaint against Jafari,[136] and Jafari was initially suspected of harassment and minor assault or possibly attempted assault.[137] The investigation against Jafari was dropped as prosecutors said he acted in self-defense, after being grabbed by the neck and pushed by the bodyguard.[138][139] Mayers was arrested after being allowed to finish his gig at Stadion.[140][141] As it was judged there was a risk that he may flee or tamper with evidence, he was kept in custody at Kronoberg Remand Prison until the trial,[135][142][143] with two members of his entourage also under arrest.[144] Mayers' ongoing tour was then put on hiatus due to the trial.[145] If he was found "not guilty", he could have reportedly been compensated more than $2 million.[146]
He was visited by personnel from the US embassy shortly after his arrest.[147] Several US artists called for a boycott of Sweden due to the incident.[148][149] A petition to release him was started.[150] Though there were initial reports by TMZ claiming Mayers was being held in inhumane conditions, based on "a source close to Rocky", Mayers denied those reports through his Swedish lawyer.[151][152] The alleged "inedible" food included turkey, veal, and rhubarb pie with custard.[153] Mayers' attorney Henrik Lilja also refuted the claims, stating that his client "has been treated correctly."[154][155] The family asked Al Sharpton for help.[156] US President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Rocky's release. Former US ambassador to Sweden Mark Brzezinski suggested that the government should intervene and speculated that racism may have been the cause of the brawl.[157] Foreign minister Margot Wallström said the government is not allowed to interfere citing Chapter 11 §3 of the Swedish constitutional Instrument of Government which explicitly forbids the interference of politicians, or unrelated government offices, in the work of the courts of law. Ove Bring, professor emeritus in international law and former international law adviser at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented that he found it strange that an ambassador does not understand the concept of separation of powers. Fredrik Wersäll, former Prosecutor-General of Sweden, also expressed surprise.[158][159]
According to Dennis Martinsson, a criminal law professor in Sweden, keeping the suspect in detention is normal in this type of case. He also said in mid-July that the case would likely end in prosecution.[160] The police conducted a search of the hotel room of Mayers' manager.[161] Mayers hired a new defense lawyer.[161] In a move that was highly unusual in Swedish criminal history, his US management hired a PR firm.[162] On July 19, the prosecutor asked for an extension until July 25 to finish the investigation.[163][164][165] First Lady Melania Trump and Kanye West asked Trump to get involved in Mayers' case, with assistance from the State Department. Trump thereafter tweeted "Just spoke to @KanyeWest about his friend A$AP Rocky's incarceration. I will be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky. So many people would like to see this quickly resolved!" [166] Carl Risch from the US Department of State visited Sweden to meet with Mayers and the two other suspects, as well as the Swedish foreign office.[167] The President told Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven he would personally bail Mayers out, "or an alternative."[168] Sweden does not have a bail system; the Prime Minister responded that Swedish courts are independent, and that the Swedish government is not allowed to interfere.[169][170] Former Prime Minister Carl Bildt expressed support for Löfven's position.[171] Rebecca Kanter, a 26-year-old woman, was apprehended after vandalising and making bomb threats against the Swedish embassy in Washington at a protest against the alleged treatment of Mayers.[172]
On July 25, Mayers was formally charged with assault causing visible bodily harm. The trial started on July 30.[173] Under interrogation, Mayers stated that the two men asked his entourage about "the road [they were on]". He claimed they came back and hit his guard, which led to a fight. They kept following them and tried to hit him, which led to the brawl. The prosecutor Daniel Suneson stated he had evidence against Mayers in the form of witness statements, and videos available on the Internet and on CCTV. Suneson said he had procured SMSes of his crew: one from his bodyguard about different versions of events, and another from an assistant showing they had uploaded edited videos on Instagram and asking Mayers to destroy everything on his cellphone. The DNA on the bottle allegedly used in the assault was also analyzed.[174]
Jafari told the police that he first approached Mayers' entourage to ask if they had seen his missing friend, not knowing who they were, but was told by the guard to go away, and then pushed. When he refused, the guard grabbed him by the neck and lifted him up, which is supported by a photo from a surveillance camera installed at a Max Hamburgers restaurant.[175] Some people close to Mayers claimed Jafari himself had broken his headphones, though he claimed it was the bodyguard, explaining that was why he was after them. The police later retrieved them from up on a roof over Kungshallen where they were thrown, but not by Jafari.[176]
The police investigation resulted in a 552-page report that included text messages and surveillance footage stills.[177]
The trial began on July 30. Present at the trial was Robert C. O'Brien, the US president's Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs. He demanded a hotel room for Mayers and the other suspects and threatened "negative consequences" if the case was not resolved quickly.[178] The prosecutor said that the trio of suspects "intentionally, together and in agreement assaulted the plaintiff by administering punches and kicks. In addition, Rakim Mayers has, with force, thrown the plaintiff on the ground.  During the assault, hits have been administered with a weapon in the shape of a whole and/or parts of a glass bottle." The victim sought 139,700 Swedish krona (approximately $14,200) in damages.[179]  Mayers pleaded "not guilty".[180] Two of the witnesses against Mayers were afraid to appear in court and gave their statements by video link instead.[181] The trial came to an end on August 2 and Mayers was released from custody, while the verdict was scheduled for August 14.[182] The decision meant that there were no longer any grounds to keep the suspects in probation, but did not say anything about the issue of guilt.[183] The same day, he left the country on his private jet.[184] If the final sentence was longer than time already served, they would have had to go back to Sweden to serve the remaining time.[185]
Sentence was passed on August 14. Mayers was convicted of assault and given a suspended prison sentence and had to pay 12,500 kr ($1,270) in damages to the victim.[186] The court could not decide who used the bottle, but said it was not a case of self-defence.[187] As Mayers had already served over a month in jail for the incident before the sentence was handed out, it was determined that he did not need to serve any additional time.[188] The conviction does not bar him from returning to Sweden.[189] Mayers did not wish to appeal the conviction.[190]
Mayers cancelled his appearance at Western University’s Purple Fest in Canada after he said he was denied a visa due to his previous conviction.[191][192]
