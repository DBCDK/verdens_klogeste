Harington was born on 26 December 1986 in Acton, London,[1][2] to Deborah Jane (Catesby), a former playwright, and Sir David Robert Harington, 15th Baronet, a businessman.[3][4][5] His full name is Christopher Catesby Harington;[6] his mother named him after Christopher Marlowe, whose first name was shortened to Kit,[7] a name Harington prefers. He did not learn what his full name was until he was eleven years old.[8] Harington's uncle was Sir Nicholas John Harington,[9] 14th Baronet,[10] and his patrilineal great-grandfather was Sir Richard Harington, 12th Baronet. The Haringtons are an ancient family that once spelled their name Haverington and derived the name from their estate, a lordship in Cumberland. The first person identified with their name was one Robert De Haverington, the son of Osulphus or Oswulf whose manor was Flemingby.[11] Through his paternal grandmother, Lavender Cecilia Denny, Harington's eighth-great-grandfather was Charles II of England.[12] Also through his father, Harington descends from Scottish politician Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville.[13]
He is related to men who were involved on opposite sides of the Gunpowder Plot. He claims a family connection with the leader of the plot, Robert Catesby, on his mother's side, while through his father's side, he is related to James I (grandfather of Charles II), the target of the assassination attempt, and to Lord Harington, who was in the Houses of Parliament that Catesby and his co-conspirators tried to blow up. Another relation, John Harington (a different branch of the family), observed at the age of 13 the displayed head of Catesby after his execution and later commented on it.[14][15]
Harington was a pupil at the Southfield Primary School from 1992 to 1998. When he was 11, his family moved to Worcestershire[16][17] and he studied at the Chantry High School in Martley until 2003.[18] He became interested in acting after watching a production of Waiting for Godot when he was 14,[19] and he performed in several school productions.[18]
He attended Worcester Sixth Form College, where he studied Drama and Theatre (2003–05). When he was 17, he was inspired to attend a drama school after seeing a performance by Ben Whishaw as Hamlet in 2004.[16][20] Harington moved back to London in 2005 when he was eighteen after graduating from Sixth Form and, later that year, attended the Central School of Speech and Drama, graduating in 2008.[21][22]
Before acting, Harington originally wanted to become a journalist.[23] While still at drama school, he landed the role of Albert in the National Theatre's adaptation of War Horse.[6][23][24] The play won two Olivier Awards and gained Harington a great deal of recognition. He was later cast in his second play Posh, a dark ensemble comedy about upper-class men attending Oxford University.[6]
After War Horse, Harington auditioned for and landed his first television role as Jon Snow in the television series Game of Thrones.

In a personal message of support, Harington said: "The learning disability sector in the UK is on the brink of crisis. It is faced with a back-pay bill of £400 million which it cannot pay. Many of the providers of this essential, ‘sleep-in’ service, face bankruptcy. And some of the most vulnerable people in our society will be left, without care, without hope and without an independent future. Stand with Mencap and stand with the incredible people our colleagues support and care for every day."[76]
