Cuoco received significant media attention surrounding a remark she made in an interview with Redbook magazine while married to Ryan Sweeting. When asked if she considered herself a feminist, Cuoco responded: "Is it bad if I say no? I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that's because I've never really faced inequality... I cook for Ryan five nights a week: it makes me feel like a housewife. I love that. I know it sounds old-fashioned, but I like the idea of women taking care of their men."[32][33]
In later interviews, Cuoco apologized for and retracted these statements, telling Cosmopolitan magazine, "Of course I'm a fucking feminist. Look at me. I bleed feminism: I get equal pay to my male costars on a big show, I have my own home, I'm as independent as you could possibly be. Maybe I didn't understand the question, but for me that's feminism. I'm killing the game, man."[34][35]
