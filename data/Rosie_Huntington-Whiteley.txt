Huntington-Whiteley was born in Plymouth, Devon,[8] the daughter of Fiona (née Jackson), a fitness instructor, and Charles, a chartered surveyor.[12] She has a brother and a sister.[13] She grew up on a farm near Tavistock, Devon.[8][14] She is a member of a noble family as her paternal great-grandfather, Wing-Commander Eric Huntington-Whiteley JP, was the nephew of George Whiteley, 1st Baron Marchamley and the younger son of politician Sir Herbert Huntington-Whiteley, 1st Baronet; Eric's wife, Rosie's great-grandmother, Enid Kohn, was from a family of Polish Jews who emigrated to England in the 1870s.[citation needed] Rosie's paternal grandmother, Gillian, also from a Jewish family, was the daughter of Jacob Franks, a prominent surgeon in Sussex.[15]

Educated at Tavistock College, she later revealed that she was bullied and teased at school for having a double-barrelled name, small breasts and full lips.[7][16] She used to smoke, as she said in an interview with David Letterman: "I got a work placement at a modelling agency and then I spent the week making coffee and picking up the telephone and smoking cigarettes and drinking wine at 11 AM, it was very Ab Fab".She last publicly smoked in 2012 and has since quit.[17]
While a 15-year-old student, she undertook work experience at London West End-based model agency Profile, before taking her GCSEs.[18] Signed after leaving school in summer 2003 aged 16, her first modelling session was for a Levi's jeans commercial.[7] She got her first big break in January 2004 when she travelled to New York City for a shoot with Teen Vogue.[18] She later made her catwalk début alongside Naomi Campbell in New York City in Spring 2004,[18] and was then photographed by Bruce Weber for Abercrombie & Fitch.[19]

Fashion photographer Rankin devoted a book entirely to her entitled Ten Times Rosie. Rankin opined that Huntington-Whiteley brought something different to modelling: "We’ve been looking at very, very skinny, almost masculine girls for a long time. [Rosie] really is the model of the moment. She’s the actress of the moment. She’s definitely going to become something much, much bigger."[37] Celebrity make-up artist Ruby Hammer, who has worked with Huntington-Whiteley for years, described her as the "quintessential" English rose.[38]
In March 2011, Huntington-Whiteley landed her first solo British Vogue cover[39] and appeared on the covers of the UK's July issues of Elle and GQ.[33][40] She was unveiled as the face of Burberry's newest fragrance, Burberry Body, in July 2011.[41][42] In 2013, Huntington-Whiteley starred alongside Helena Bonham Carter and David Gandy in the Marks & Spencer Christmas advert.[43] She was also announced as the face of Australian cosmetics brand ModelCo.[44]  In 2014, PAIGE announced Huntington-Whiteley as their ambassador for their upcoming Spring 2015 ad campaign.[45] In February 2017, PAIGE launched their first ever design collaboration with Huntington-Whiteley on a 17 piece capsule collection for Spring called Rosie HW x PAIGE.[46][47] This was followed by a Fall collection consisting of 20 pieces.[48]

Reviewers were critical of the acting of Huntington-Whiteley and co-star Shia LaBeouf. Peter Travers (of Wenner Media) stated the two "couldn't be duller".[52] Jason Solomons of The Observer wrote that "we're first introduced to Rosie via a close-up of her bum, segueing straight from the film's opening sequence and titles on to the pert buttocks and underwear of our heroine", and that Huntington-Whiteley's English posh girl accent "renders her practically unintelligible when surrounded by American accents and falling masonry".[53] Much of the criticism towards Rosie Huntington-Whiteley compared her in an unfavorable light to Megan Fox. Lou Lumenick said that her "'acting' makes...Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep in comparison".[54] In a positive review, Drew McWeeny of HitFix said, "She reminds me of Cameron Diaz in The Mask, an actress who doesn't really show off any range, but who gives a natural, winning performance and who is up to the challenge of this particular picture."[55]
Huntington-Whiteley had her second acting role in the film Mad Max: Fury Road, which was released in May 2015. She played The Splendid Angharad, one of the Five Wives of the warlord Immortan Joe. In order to portray her pregnant character, she wore a prosthetic stomach throughout the film.[56][57]
