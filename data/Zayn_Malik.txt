A book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), released in February 2011, topped The Sunday Times' Best Seller list.[23][24] The same month, the boy band performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK as part of the X Factor Live Tour.[25] The group's debut studio album Up All Night was released in November 2011 in the UK and Ireland.

That same month, One Direction's first book to be licensed in America, Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction, was published and topped The New York Times Best Seller list.[28]
In September 2012, One Direction released the "Live While We're Young", the lead single from their second album, and it reached the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist in the US.[29] It recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist at the time.[30] The album's second single, Little Things, spawned the band's second number one single in the UK.[31]

It was the best-selling album worldwide in 2013 with 4 million copies sold globally.[38] The album's number one debut on Billboard 200 made One Direction the first band in history to have their first three albums all debut atop the Billboard 200. The lead single from the album, "Best Song Ever", is the group's highest charting single in the US to date.[39] They embarked on the Where We Are Tour, their first all-stadium tour in 2014. Tickets sold out in minutes,[40][41] and more shows were added due to "overwhelming demand."[42] The band averaged 49,848 fans per show.[43] The tour grossed over $290 million and was the highest-grossing tour of 2014, the 15th highest-grossing concert tour of all time, and is still the highest-grossing tour of all time by a vocal group.[44] In September 2014, One Direction's fourth book, One Direction: Who We Are: Our Official Autobiography was released.

On 18 March 2015, following the band's 16th show of the tour, it was announced the Malik had become overwhelmed with stress, and would be absent for the remaining shows of Asian leg of the tour.[48] A week later, on 25 March 2015, the band announced his departure.[49] In the band's official statement, Malik cited his desire to live as a "normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight". He denied rumors of any rift between the members, explaining that the band had been supportive of the decision.[50][51][52]
In March 2015, Malik was seen at a London recording studio with producer Naughty Boy.[53] Following his departure from One Direction, Malik alluded to the potential of a solo career, with the release of his first solo studio album to be released under the Syco label in 2016.[54][55] The same month Naughty Boy released on SoundCloud an early demo of Malik's song "I Won't Mind".[56] In June 2015, UK rapper Mic Righteous leaked Malik's "No Type", featuring Mic Righteous and produced by Naughty Boy, a cover version of Rae Sremmurd's hip hop song.[57] Malik also worked with grime rappers Krept & Konan during this time, but the material was never released after Malik parted ways with Naughty Boy.[58] Though unreleased, his work with Naughty Boy and Krept & Konan helped Malik gain a new urban audience in the UK.[59]
By July 2015 Malik announced he had signed a recording deal with RCA Records.[60] Later that year, Malik gave several interviews where he talked about his debut solo studio album and revealed part of the track list. Talking with The Fader, he stated "life experiences have been the influences for the album and just stuff that I've been through, especially in the last five years". In a conversation with Billboard, Malik's main collaborator for the album James "Malay" Ho said they have gone to unusual lengths in pursuit of inspiration during recording sessions, for one "we went camping for a week in the Angeles Forest – set up a generator and a tent so we could track in the woods."[61] In his first solo on-camera interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music's Beats 1, Malik revealed Mind of Mine as the album's title.[62]
The album's lead single, "Pillowtalk", was released in January 2016. The song debuted at number one in a number of countries, including the UK Singles Chart[63] and the US Billboard Hot 100;[64] on the latter, it became the 25th song to debut at number one, making him the first UK artist to debut at number one on the Hot 100 with a first charted single.[64] The single's performance propelled Zayn to number six on the Billboard Artist 100 chart.[65] Worldwide, he had the highest first-day and weekly streams for a debut artist.[66] The album's second official single, "Like I Would", reached number one on Billboard's Dance Club Songs chart.[67] The end of February 2016 also saw the releases of the "Pillowtalk (Lil Wayne Remix)", which features American rapper Lil Wayne, and Chris Brown's R&B song "Back to Sleep (Remix)", featuring Usher and Malik.[68]
The album was released in March 2016 and includes songs co-written by Malik and a team of professional songwriters, whittled down from 46 tracks he reportedly considered;[69] one of the songs on the album features American R&B singer-songwriter Kehlani.[70][71] Primarily R&B and alternative R&B, the album blends elements from a number of genres.[72] Despite the variations in the sounds and genres, Mind of Mine is structured in an "album-as-complete-work" form, maintaining a tightly knit cohesion throughout the record, with an almost seamless transition between and across songs,[59][73][74] while maintaining a recognisable, mostly downbeat, "hazy" tone throughout.[75][76][77][78] This gives the album a continuous flow,[75] and gives the impression that it all came from one person's "mind."[74] It has received generally positive reviews, with praise for Malik's new musical direction, his vocals, and the music production.[79][80][81]
Mind of Mine debuted at number one in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and United States, where he became the first British male solo artist to debut at number one with his first album.

Malik cites urban music as his main musical influence, having grown up predominantly with R&B, hip hop, and reggae,[61][115] as well as bop[8] and Bollywood music.[116] He was influenced by his father's urban records, including Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, R. Kelly, Usher, Donell Jones, Prince, 2Pac, Biggie, Gregory Isaacs, Yellowman and Chris Brown.[117][8][118] Malik originally auditioned to be a solo R&B singer, before becoming part of One Direction. His R&B singing style stood out compared to the band's pop rock style; he later cited creative differences as a reason for leaving the band.[8] His solo work leans towards R&B[8] and alternative R&B,[119][120] and occasionally other genres, such as electro-R&B dance music ("Like I Would"),[121][122] hip hop ("Pillowtalk" remix where Malik is rapping and rap-singing with Lil Wayne),[123][124] neo-soul ("Truth"),[125] reggae ("Do Something Good"),[126] and Qawwali ghazal ("Flower"[127][128] where he uses Qawwali vocal techniques such as vocal elisions[129] and warbling).[78]
Malik possesses a wide tenor vocal range, and is known for his belting and falsetto singing techniques and hitting high notes with his vocals.[130][131] He was regarded by Jamieson Cox in Time as the band's strongest singer.[132] Brad Nelson of The Guardian wrote "He was one of the more accomplished vocalists of the group, exhibiting the widest range. He mostly inhabited a silvery, full-bodied tenor, similar to but more sharp and precise than Harry Styles' smoky warble", asserting that his departure would leave "a void of vocal agility".[133]
Malik was known as the "Bradford Bad Boy" of One Direction, due to his mischievous behaviour, scandals, many tattoos, graffiti art, and rock star hairstyles.[134][135][136] Since before X-Factor, Malik has been a fan of tattoos, saying that he likes "getting tattoos and that he loves the whole culture behind them."[10] His first tattoo was revealed on his Twitter account. Malik got his maternal grandfather's name inked in Arabic: والتر (Walter). Since then, Malik has had several more tattoos.[137] Discussing Malik's possible solo career after leaving the boyband, Billboard editor Joe Lynch described him as "the quiet one in the group [...] never the one to grab the spotlight during interviews. He typically saved his words for the songs, not for media soundbytes."[138]
In Pakistan, Malik is often named in the list of notable Pakistanis who live abroad.[139] In 2011, he was ranked number 27 on Glamour's "World's Sexiest Men" list.[140] In 2014, Malik was voted British GQ's best dressed male.[141] In 2015, he was voted the "Sexiest Male in Pop" in a poll by British radio network Capital,[142] voted as the "World's Sexiest Asian Man" based on a worldwide poll by the British newspaper Eastern Eye,[143] voted second place in a poll of the "World's top ten bachelors" by Manchester's Crown Clinic,[144] and ranked number six on MTV's "50 sexiest men alive" list.[145] In 2016, he was ranked number five on Glamour magazine's "100 Sexiest Men" list.[146] As of April 2016, Forbes estimates his online social media following (across Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pandora) to be over 50 million users.[147] Malik's fandom is known as Zquad.[148]
Malik began dating singer Perrie Edwards of Little Mix in early 2012;[149] they got engaged in 2013.[150] On 4 August 2015, Malik's representative announced that the couple had ended their engagement a few weeks prior.[151]
Malik began dating American model Gigi Hadid in late 2015.[152] Hadid appeared in Zayn's music video for "Pillowtalk". They appeared together on the August 2017 cover of Vogue.[153] Malik and Hadid are the third couple to appear together on a Vogue cover, which courted controversy because of Vogue misnaming them as gender fluid, for which Vogue apologized.[154] They also did a Versus (Versace) campaign as a couple, with Hadid as the photographer.[155][156] On 13 March 2018, Hadid and Malik announced their split in separate statements on social media.[157] In June 2018, Hadid confirmed their reconciled relationship on social media.[158][159] They split up again in November 2018.[160]
Malik speaks English and Urdu, and can read Arabic.[161] He said that, prior to his music career, he had planned to pursue an academic degree in English or literature.[162]
Malik was raised as a Muslim.[8][139] He had been a target of anti-Muslim slurs,[8][163] which led to him deleting his Twitter account in 2012.[164] Two days later, he was back on Twitter.[165] During the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Malik posted the message "#FreePalestine" on Twitter, resulting in him receiving angry responses and death threats.[166] He has since avoided publicly expressing political views.[11] In 2017, Malik said he identified as a non-practising Muslim, but said he did not "want to be defined by [his] religion or [his] cultural background."[167] He later told British Vogue in November 2018 that he would not call himself a Muslim anymore, and stated that his parents accepted his adult decision to no longer identify with Islam.[168] He believes in God[168] and generally prefers not to discuss religious topics in public.[169]
He is an official ambassador of the British Asian Trust charity group, contributing to improving the lives of disadvantaged people living in South Asia.[170] With his former group One Direction, he contributed to African fundraising events with Comic Relief.[171] In April 2014, Malik donated his guitar to the Kean's Children Fund in Dundee, Scotland. The charity founder Charlie Kean was organising an online auction for the guitar and the money raised from the auction will be used to buy iPads for the children's ward at Ninewells.[172] In March 2016, he bought a box at Bradford City for underprivileged children to watch football, named after his maternal grandfather Walter Brannan.[173]
