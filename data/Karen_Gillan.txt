Karen Sheila Gillan was born in Inverness on 28 November 1987,[1] the daughter of Marie and Raymond Gillan.[2] When she turned 16, she moved to Edinburgh and completed an HNC Acting and Performance course at Telford College.[3] She moved to London at age 18 to study at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts.[4][5] While there, she was scouted by a modelling agency.[6] Prior to her acting career, she worked as a model, premiering at London Fashion Week in 2007. Gillan has said she would not give up her acting career to return to modelling, stating that while she enjoyed modelling, acting had always been her main interest and goal.[7]
Gillan's early television acting career included guest appearances on several television shows, with her first role being in an episode of ITV crime drama Rebus, a role for which she had to drop out of school.[8][9] Gillan then undertook a two-year stint as a member of the ensemble cast of the sketch comedy series The Kevin Bishop Show, in which she played multiple characters including celebrities such as Katy Perry and Angelina Jolie. Gillan also appeared on TV in a leading role in a horror project entitled The Well, which was broadcast as a series of episodic short films on BBC Two and later as a web series on BBC.co.uk. Part of the BBC's multimedia "switch" programming, the short episodes interconnect with online games that further explore the environments presented in the series.[10] In 2008, she starred in the Channel 4 television film Stacked.
Gillan went on to portray Amy Pond, companion to the Eleventh Doctor (portrayed by Matt Smith), on the British sci-fi series Doctor Who. Before being cast in the role in May 2009, she had previously appeared on Doctor Who in Series 4 episode "The Fires of Pompeii" in the role of a soothsayer.[6] She made her first on-screen appearance as Amy in "The Eleventh Hour" with her cousin Caitlin Blackwood portraying a younger version of the same character.[11][12][13] In 2010, she won in the Entertainment category at the Young Scot Awards. She appeared in the sixth series in 2011 and the first five episodes of the seventh series in 2012,[14] after which her character and Rory Williams (portrayed by Arthur Darvill) left the series.[15] Gillan reprised her role in the 2013 Christmas special "The Time of the Doctor", to coincide with Smith's departure as the Doctor.
Gillan was cast in the third season of A Touch of Cloth, which was co-created by Charlie Brooker.[16] She then joined the regular cast of Adult Swim's NTSF:SD:SUV:: for the show's third season in 2013.[17][18]
In February 2014, Gillan was cast as the lead in Selfie, an American single-camera sitcom for ABC produced by Warner Bros. Television which was greenlit for the 2014–15 US television season. Gillan played a socialite named Eliza Dooley, a modern-day take on Eliza Doolittle, who is obsessed with social media. This was Gillan's first time in the lead role of an American television series.[19][20][21] The series was cancelled by ABC on 7 November 2014 after seven episodes;[22] the remaining six episodes were made available on Hulu starting 25 November 2014.[23]
After making an appearance in Outcast, it was announced that Gillan would star in an indie Scottish romantic comedy called Not Another Happy Ending alongside Emun Elliott in August 2011.[24] She was selected by director John McKay because he came to know her during the production of We'll Take Manhattan, which he also directed, as "a very bubbly, vibrant, energetic, funny, slightly clumsy person" who was a perfect fit for the character.[25] Filming took place in July 2012,[24] though Elliott was replaced by Stanley Weber.[26] Gillan told journalists that she was happy to be involved in a Scottish production that "isn't about drug use or fighting the English".[27] The film premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in June 2013.[28][29][30] In 2012, Gillan appeared in the television film We'll Take Manhattan playing the part of supermodel Jean Shrimpton, which told the story of Shrimpton's relationship with the photographer David Bailey.[31]

In May 2013, Gillan was cast as Nebula in the Marvel superhero science fiction film Guardians of the Galaxy, which was released in August 2014.[33] Gillan had her head shaved bald for the role, which Marvel turned into the wig that Gillan wore during the production of Selfie.[34]

During a 2012 interview on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Gillen stated that she had permanently relocated to the U.S. around the time she was shooting the film Oculus (2013).[8] Although she comes from a Catholic background, she has said that she was not christened and is not religious, instead believing that "we're just minuscule dots in the vast cosmic emptiness of the universe".[58]
