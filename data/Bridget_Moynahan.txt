Kathryn Bridget Moynahan was born in Binghamton, New York.[2] She is the daughter of Irish Americans Mary Bridget (née Moriarty), a former school teacher, and Edward Bradley Moynahan, a scientist and former administrator at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.[3] Moynahan has two brothers, Andy and Sean.[4] When Moynahan was around seven years old, her family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts [3] where she later attended Longmeadow High School, and was captain of the girls' soccer, basketball, and lacrosse teams,[5] graduating in 1989.[6] She has said that, during her childhood, she was a tomboy.[3]
After graduating from high school, Moynahan pursued a modeling career despite admitting she had never read fashion magazines growing up.[7] She had accompanied a friend to a modeling audition in Springfield, Massachusetts,[4] and was signed by the modeling agency instead of her friend.[7] She began her career appearing in department-store catalogs in Springfield, during which time she attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Moynahan moved to New York at age 18 and, a year later, began appearing in magazines such as Vogue and Elle, and on covers of other widely known magazines.[8] Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times).[9] Discussing her early work in an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan said, "It was a crazy world that paid a lot of money. I liked being a model, but I knew it would never last, so I looked into acting."[3]
During that time, she began doing soap and shampoo commercials,[10] in addition to taking acting and art classes.  She studied acting at the Caymichael Patten Studio in New York,[8] and in 1999, made her TV debut as Natasha in HBO's romantic comedy Sex and the City.[11] She later had a recurring role in the show, until the divorce of her character from Mr. Big (Chris Noth).[12] The following year, she appeared in smaller film roles, including having parts in In the Weeds and Whipped.[8]
Moynahan made her feature-film debut in the 2000 comedy-drama Coyote Ugly as Rachel, a bartender/dancer in a wild New York bar,[13] a role that is considered Moynahan's breakthrough.[14] She had accepted the role because she "thought it was interesting that the whole movie revolved around five women…and my character was so strong and independent."[11] The film garnered generally unfavorable critical reviews,[15] but was a box-office success, earning $133 million worldwide.[16] Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film Serendipity as Hally, the fiancée of John Cusack's character.[17]
Moynahan was then cast opposite Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman in the action film The Sum of All Fears, based on Tom Clancy's book of the same name.[18] Moynahan plays Dr. Catherine Muller, a love interest for Affleck's Jack Ryan.[19] Dave Larsen of the Dayton Daily News reported that the subplot involving Moynahan and Affleck was "the film's weakest point".[20] The Sum of All Fears received ambivalent reviews,[21] but was a commercial success, earning $193 million at the box office.[22] Her next role was as a CIA trainee in The Recruit (2003).[23] The movie was not well received,[24] with Mike Clark of USA Today commenting that The Recruit is "less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend".[25]
In 2004, Moynahan starred alongside Will Smith in Alex Proyas' science-fiction movie I, Robot, loosely based on Isaac Asimov's short-story collection of the same name.[26] Moynahan portrays Dr. Susan Calvin,  a specialist in robot psychology.[27] Upon release, I, Robot received mixed reviews,[28] though critics enjoyed Moynahan's performance. Daniel Neman of Richmond Times-Dispatch, who disliked the film, concluded that she "turns in an able performance as Dr. Calvin, the convenient character."[29] With revenue of $347 million worldwide, the film remains Moynahan's most commercially successful picture to date.[30] Her next movie was in 2005's Lord of War, a political crime thriller, as Ava Fontaine Orlov, the wife of Nicolas Cage's character.[31] In 2006, Maxim  named her number 96 on its annual "Hot 100" list.[32]
In September 2006, away from film, Moynahan starred as Whitney Crane in the ABC television drama series Six Degrees, co-starring alongside Jay Hernandez, Erika Christensen, Hope Davis, Dorian Missick, and Campbell Scott.[33] The series centered on six residents of New York City and their respective relationships and connections with one another, based on the idea of six degrees of separation.[34] It debuted on September 20, 2006, and was watched by almost 13.3 million viewers.[35] Six Degrees debuted to varied reception,[36] with David Hinckley of the New York Daily News writing, "In theory, it's an intriguing concept for a series. But in practice, Six Degrees doesn't work at all in drawing you in at the start."[36] After one season, the series was cancelled in May 2007.[37]
Moynahan's next film role was in the November 2006 thriller Unknown, about a group of individuals kidnapped, and trying to work together how to escape from their captors.[38] She was next seen in 2007, in Gray Matters, starring alongside Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh,[39] before being cast in Henry Bean's comedy-drama Noise, as Helen Owen, the wife of David Owen (Tim Robbins).[40] The movie was screened at a special presentation at the 2007 Rome Film Festival[41] and was released in theaters in 2008.[42]
