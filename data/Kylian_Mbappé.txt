Kylian Mbappé Lottin (French pronunciation: ​[kiljan (ɛ)mbape lɔtɛ̃]; born 20 December 1998) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the France national team. Considered one of the best players in the world, he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed.
Mbappé started his senior career playing for Ligue 1 club Monaco, where he made his professional debut in 2015, aged 16. With them, he won a Ligue 1 title, Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year, and the Golden Boy award. In 2017, Mbappé signed for league rivals Paris Saint-Germain on an initial loan, which was made permanent a year later in a transfer worth €180 million, making him the second-most expensive player, and most expensive teenager, ever.[4] With PSG, Mbappé won two Ligue 1 titles, a Coupe de France, has finished as Ligue 1 top scorer and won Ligue 1 Player of the Year, and is the eighth-highest goalscorer in the club's history. 
At international level, Mbappé made his senior debut for France in 2017, at age 18. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Mbappé became the youngest French player to score at a World Cup, and became the second teenager, after Pelé, to score in a World Cup Final. He finished as the joint second-highest goalscorer as France won the tournament, and he received the Best Young Player and French Player of the Year awards for his performances.
Kylian Mbappé was born in Paris, France.[3] His father, Wilfried Mbappé, is from Cameroon, and, as well as being his agent, is a football coach, while his mother, Fayza Lamari, is of Algerian (Kabyle) origin and is a former handball player.[5][6] He has a younger brother, Ethan Mbappé, who plays for PSG under-12s.[7][8] His adoptive brother, Jirès Kembo Ekoko, is also a professional football player.[9] Growing up, his idol was Cristiano Ronaldo, a player he looked to emulate.[10][11]
—Atmane Airouche, president of AS Bondy, on Mbappé as a child.[6]
Mbappé began his career at AS Bondy, coached by his father, Wilfrid. Another of his youth coaches at AS Bondy, Antonio Riccardi, stated,
The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'crack' (the best).[12]
Eventually, he moved to the Clairefontaine academy, putting on a host of impressive performances leading to numerous French clubs, and Real Madrid, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Bayern Munich, attempting to sign him.[6] Mbappé travelled to London for a trial with Chelsea when he was 11, playing a match for their youth team against Charlton Athletic.[13] He ultimately settled on Monaco.[14]
Mbappé made his first team debut on 2 December 2015 in a 1–1 Ligue 1 home draw against SM Caen, replacing Fábio Coentrão after 88 minutes. He therefore became Monaco's youngest-ever first-team player aged 16 years and 347 days, breaking Thierry Henry's record set 21 years previously.[14][15]
On 20 February 2016, Mbappé scored his first goal for the club's first team, a stoppage-time goal in a home Ligue 1 3–1 win over Troyes; at the age of 17 years and 62 days, he became the youngest first team goalscorer in Monaco's history—once again displacing Henry in the process.[16][17] On 6 March 2016, Mbappé signed his first professional contract, a three-year deal, tying him to Monaco until June 2019.[18] In an interview with CNN, Vadim Vasilyev, AS Monaco's vice-president, who played a key role in Mbappé signing his first professional contract with the Ligue 1 club, stated that he knew early on that Mbappé was a "phenomenon."[19]
Mbappé scored the first hat-trick of his first team career on 14 December 2016 in the 7–0 rout of Stade Rennais in the Coupe de la Ligue round of 16 at the Stade Louis II[15][20] – the first hat-trick scored by any Monaco player in the competition since Sonny Anderson in 1997.[21]
On 11 February 2017, Mbappé scored the first Ligue 1 hat-trick of his career in the 5–0 home win over Metz; at 18 years and two months he became the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick since Jérémy Ménez did it for FC Sochaux-Montbéliard back in 2005.[22]
On 21 February, Mbappé scored Monaco's second goal in the 40th minute with a half-volley after receiving Fabinho's long ball over the opponents' back line (it was his first ever UEFA Europa League or UEFA Champions League goal and he became the second youngest French scorer in UEFA Champions League history behind Karim Benzema) in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg match against Manchester City, which Monaco lost 5–3.[23][24] On 5 March, Mbappé scored two first-half goals in the 4–0 Ligue 1 home win over FC Nantes to bring his Ligue 1 career tally to ten goals and become the youngest player in the last 30 years to hit the Ligue 1/Division 1 ten-career-goals mark. His brace against Nantes on 5 March brought up his 2016–17 season tally to nine Ligue 1 goals and five Ligue 1 assists in just 822 minutes of Ligue 1 football.[25][26] On 11 March, he scored a goal in the 2–1 Ligue 1 home win against FC Girondins de Bordeaux to register his seventh Ligue 1 goal in his last four starts.[27]
In the UEFA Champions League round of 16-second leg match at the Stade Louis II on 15 March, he made the score 1–0 for Monaco in the 8th minute by turning home Bernardo Silva's low cross from close-range (his 11th goal in his past 11 matches in all competitions) to help Monaco beat Manchester City 3–1 (aggregate score 6–6) and advance to the quarter-finals on the away goals rule.[28] In the quarter-finals against Borussia Dortmund, Mbappé won a penalty and scored two goals as Monaco won the away leg 3–2.[29] In the second leg, Mbappé opened the scoring as Monaco won 3–1 and advanced to the semi-finals.[30] Monaco were eliminated from the Champions League 4–1 on aggregate by Juventus, with Mbappé scoring Monaco's lone goal in the second leg.[31] Mbappé ended the 2016–17 season with 26 goals from 44 matches in all competitions as Monaco won the Ligue 1 title.[32]
On 31 August 2017, Paris Saint-Germain announced the signing of Mbappé from Monaco on loan.[33] The fee required for a subsequent full transfer was set at a rumoured €145 million plus €35 million in add-ons, making him the most expensive teenager ever, the most expensive transfer ever within a domestic league, and potentially the second most expensive player ever, behind teammate Neymar.[34][35][36][37] He was handed the number 29 shirt upon arrival in the French capital.[38]
He scored on his debut on 8 September in a 5–1 Ligue 1 win at Metz, in which Benoît Assou-Ekotto was sent off for fouling him.[39] Four days later, Mbappé recorded his first European goal for Les Parisiens in a 5–0 UEFA Champions League group stage away defeat of Celtic.[40] He starred in PSG's 3–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the second group game of the Champions League, setting up goals for Edinson Cavani and Neymar, the latter seeing him taking out a defender with a feint by rolling the ball under his foot.[41] On 6 December, Mbappé scored his 10th Champions League goal in a 3–1 defeat to Bayern Munich and became the youngest player to reach that mark at the age of 18 years and 11 months.[42] Having won his first league title with the club, on 8 May 2018, Mbappé played as PSG won 2–0 against Les Herbiers VF to clinch the 2017–18 Coupe de France.[43]
In July 2018, Mbappé was given the number 7 jersey for the upcoming season with PSG, taking up the squad number vacated by Lucas Moura.[44] Sporting the hashtag #K7LIAN, Mbappé stated, "I keep trying to progress on the pitch and I think that, for me, it was the right time to change number. It is something of an affirmation. The No. 7 shirt is a legendary one and many greats have worn it. I hope that I will be able to do this number justice on the pitch."[44]
In his first appearance of the season, Mbappé scored twice in the last 10 minutes as PSG won 3–1 against Guingamp in Ligue 1.[45] In the following league game, the front three of Mbappé, Cavani and Neymar all scored in a 3–1 win over Angers at home, with Mbappé – starting his first game of the season – scoring from a volley and setting up Neymar to score the third.[46] On 1 September, he scored and assisted in a 4–2 away win over Nîmes, but was sent off for the first time in his career with a straight red card in injury time, after shoving Téji Savanier in retaliation for a late challenge from behind, for which Savanier was also sent off.[47] Regarding his sending-off, Mbappé told reporters after the match, "If I had the chance to do it over again, I would do the same thing. I will apologise to the supporters and everybody, but I cannot tolerate this sort of thing."[48] On 8 October, Mbappé scored four goals in just 13 minutes in a 5–0 home victory over Lyon and became the youngest player (19 years and 9 months) to score four goals in one game in Ligue 1 over the last 45 seasons.[49] On 3 December, Mbappé was the inaugural winner of the Kopa Trophy, which is awarded by France Football to the best player in the world under the age of 21.[50]
On 19 January 2019, Mbappé was one of two players (the other being Cavani) to score a hat-trick in a 9–0 win over Guingamp, breaking a record PSG set the previous season.[51] On 2 March, he scored twice in a 2–1 away win over Caen; his second goal of the match, which came from a penalty, was his 50th for the club.[52] On 12 March 2019, he scored the 2nd goal in a 0–4 away win against Dijon FCO in Ligue 1.[53] PSG finished the season as Ligue 1 champions,[54] with Mbappé winning the Player of the Year award,[55] while also finishing the season as the top goalscorer with 33 goals.[54]
On 3 August, Mbappé scored in a 2–1 win over Rennes to capture his first title of the 2019–20 season, the 2019 Trophée des Champions.[56] He then scored again in PSG's opening Ligue 1 match of the season, a 3–0 home win over Nîmes on 11 August.[57] On 22 October, he came off the bench and scored a perfect hat-trick,[58] in a 5–0 away win over Belgian side Club Brugge in the Champions League; at the age of 20 years and 306 days, he became the youngest player ever to score at least 15 goals in the competition.[59]
Mbappé capped a fine debut senior season at Monaco by scoring five times for France as they won the 2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, the striker almost single-handedly securing their spot in the final with a sparkling performance in their 3–1 victory against Portugal in the semi-finals.[14]
Mbappé was called up to the senior France squad for the first time to face Luxembourg and Spain in March 2017.[60] He made his debut on 25 March against the former side, coming on for Dimitri Payet in the 78th minute of a 3–1 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification away win.[15] In doing so, he became the second youngest player ever (only behind Maryan Wisnieski) to feature for France at 18 years, three months and five days old.[61] On 31 August 2017, Mbappé scored his first senior international goal in a 2018 World Cup qualification match against the Netherlands.[62] He scored twice against Russia in a friendly in March 2018.[63]
On 17 May 2018, Mbappé was called up to the France squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.[64] On 21 June 2018, he scored his first World Cup goal in France's 1–0 Group C win over Peru. This made him the youngest French goalscorer in World Cup history at age 19.[65] On 30 June 2018, he was named man of the match in a 4–3 win over Argentina, scoring twice and suffering a foul in the box which resulted in Antoine Griezmann opening the score from a penalty kick.[66] Mbappé was the second teenager to score two goals in a World Cup match after Pelé in 1958.[67] In a post-match press conference, Mbappé stated: "It's flattering to be the second one after Pelé but let's put things into context – Pelé is in another category."[68]
On 15 July, Mbappé scored with a 25-yard strike against Croatia in the 2018 World Cup Final, with France winning 4–2.[69] He became the second teenager, after Pelé, to score in a World Cup Final, and with four goals in the tournament he received the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player Award.[70] Pelé congratulated him on social media, and stated "welcome to the club".[71]
On 11 June 2019, Mbappé scored his 100th career goal in a 4–0 away win over Andorra in Euro 2020 qualifying.[72]
Mbappé has been described by Arsène Wenger as a "huge football talent" who "has similarities to Thierry Henry".[73] His talent and precocious performances for France at the 2018 World Cup also led him to be compared to Pelé in the media.[74] A versatile forward, Mbappé often plays as a winger, and is capable of playing on either flank, due to his ability with both feet.[75][76] He is capable of cutting into the centre onto his stronger right foot from the left wing, and is also capable of creating chances and providing assists for teammates from the right due to his vision.[77][78][79][80] He is also able to play in the centre as a main striker, due to his composure, clinical finishing, and eye for goal.[81][82][83][84] A highly skillful player, Mbappé is also known for his excellent dribbling ability, as well as his explosive acceleration, agility, quick feet, and creativity when in possession of the ball, as demonstrated by his use of elaborate feints, such as step overs, or sudden changes of pace or direction to beat opponents in one on one situations.[85][86][87] In spite of his tall lean frame, he is also an athletic player, gifted with physical strength.[88]
In addition to his technical skills, Mbappé is also highly regarded for his outstanding pace and close ball control when dribbling at speed, as well as his intelligent movement and ability to beat the defensive line by making attacking runs into space both on and off the ball; his ability to time his runs enables him to stretch opposing defences, and also make him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks.[77][86][89][90] Regarding Mbappé's ability to run at defences, former France international Nicolas Anelka stated, "He reminds me of Ronaldo of the 1996 Olympics. He has the characteristics of a world-class player and he must manage them properly. If he follows Ronaldo's career, 'O Phenomenon', he will be one of the legends that has made history in the sport."[91] When Stefan de Vrij, central defender for Inter Milan and the Netherlands, was asked of his toughest opponent, he placed Mbappé ahead of anyone else, including Mbappé's childhood idol Cristiano Ronaldo.[92] In 2018, Mbappé was considered the world's most expensive player from a transfer value perspective by the CIES.[93]
Mbappé's usual goal celebration, – posing with his arms crossed and hands tucked under his armpits – which he performed after scoring in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final, was inspired by his younger brother Ethan, who would celebrate in this manner when beating Kylian at FIFA.[94]
In a 2018 interview with Time, Mbappé spoke about the sacrifices he made as a teenager to focus on his football development: "I did not have the moments of so-called normal people during adolescence, like going out with friends, enjoying good times." But despite missing out on a "normal" life, Mbappé states he is "living the life he always dreamed of".[95] Just over two years after making his professional debut he has over 20 million Instagram followers.[95] While he admits his "life has been totally turned upside down" since he first entered the spotlight, he says he is "happy".[95]
Mbappé has a sponsorship deal with sportswear and equipment supplier Nike. In 2017, his prodigious talent saw Nike launch his own personalised football boots at age 18, the Kylian Mbappé Nike Hypervenom 3.[96] In 2018, he unveiled the Nike Mercurial Superfly VI boots which were inspired by the R9 Mercurial boots of former Brazilian striker Ronaldo.[97]
Mbappé features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series:
on FIFA 18 he had the highest potential rating of 94.[98][99] His trademark goal celebration – posing with his arms folded and hands tucked under his armpits – was inspired by his younger brother Ethan who would celebrate in this manner when beating Kylian at FIFA.[94][100] The celebration appears in FIFA 19.[101]
On 22 February 2018, Mbappé was joined by two of Africa's greatest strikers, former A.C. Milan forward and current Liberia President George Weah, and former Chelsea and Ivory Coast forward Didier Drogba, in a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the Élysée Palace in Paris that focused on a sports development project in Africa.[102] Mbappé stated that the development of African sport is important to him due to his parents' African origins.[103]
On 28 January 2019, Mbappé donated $34,000 (around £26,000) to a crowdfunding campaign to finance a private search mission to find football player Emiliano Sala, whose light aircraft had gone missing over the English Channel a week earlier.[104] Later, on 10 February 2019, Mbappé donated a further £27,000 to the GoFundMe campaign created to fund the search for the plane's still-missing pilot, David Ibbotson.[105]
