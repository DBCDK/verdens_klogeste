Dua Lipa was born in Westminster, London, to Kosovo Albanian parents. Her father Dukagjin Lipa is a marketing manager who is also lead vocalist in a Kosovan rock band, Oda. Her mother Anesa Lipa (née Rexha) works in tourism. Her parents are originally from Kosovo[a] but left Pristina in 1992.[7][8] Her father Dukagjin is the son of historian Seit Lipa who was the head of the Kosovo Institute of History from 1990 to 1995. Lipa has two younger siblings.[9] She attended Sylvia Young Theatre School part-time[10] before moving to Kosovo with her family in 2006 when her father had been offered a job.[5] There she attended the Mileniumi i Tretë school in Pristina,[11] and became a fan of hip hop artists, which would later influence her music style.[12] Her first name means "love" in Albanian. Lipa explained "Now I'm proud of it. Now I am. But when I was growing up, all I wanted was to be called Hannah, Sarah, Ella… anything normal. Because with Dua you had to explain: I'm from Kosovo."[13]
At the age of 14, Lipa began posting covers of her favourite songs by artists such as Pink and Nelly Furtado on YouTube,[14][15] and wrote her first song, titled "Lions, Tigers and Bears".[16] At the age of 15, she moved back to London with aspirations of becoming a singer.[17] Lipa lived with a friend and studied at Parliament Hill School, returning to the Sylvia Young Theatre School on Saturdays.[18] She finished her A-levels in Politics, Psychology, English and Media.[19] In order to earn money for her writing sessions, Lipa had different jobs, such as hostessing restaurants and nightclubs.[20] She began working as a model for the online catalogue ASOS Marketplace when she was 16,[19] with the goal of meeting people who could help her with her music career.[14] However, she left after a manager told her to lose weight.[14] Lipa had her first writing collaboration with musician Marlon Roudette. She explained, "He was the first guy who sat down with me with a piano and was just like 'let's write a song together'.
