                "text": "no title\n\nCharles, Prince of Wales (Charles Philip Arthur George; born 14 November 1948) is the heir apparent to the British throne as the eldest son of Elizabeth II. He has been Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay since 1952, and he is the oldest and longest-serving heir apparent in British history.[2] He is also the longest-serving Prince of Wales, having held that title since 1958.[3] Charles was born at Buckingham Palace as the first grandchild of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He was educated at Cheam and Gordonstoun schools, which his father, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, had attended as a child. Charles also spent a year at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge, Charles served in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976. In 1981, he married Lady Diana Spencer, and they had two sons: Prince William (b. 1982) and Prince Harry (b. 1984). In 1996, the couple divorced following well-publicised extramarital affairs by both parties. Diana died as the result of a car crash in Paris the following year. In 2005, Charles married long-time partner Camilla Parker Bowles. As Prince of Wales, Charles undertakes official duties on behalf of the Queen and the Commonwealth realms. Charles founded The Prince's Trust in 1976, sponsors The Prince's Charities, and is a patron, president, and a member of over 400 other charities and organisations. As an environmentalist, he raises awareness of organic farming and climate change, which has earned him awards and recognition from environmental groups.[4][5][6][7] His support for alternative medicine, including homeopathy, has been criticised by some in the medical community,[8][9] and his views on the role of architecture in society and the conservation of historic buildings have received considerable attention from British architects and design critics.[10][11][12] Since 1993, Charles has worked on the creation of Poundbury, an experimental new town based on his preferences. He is also an author and co-author of a number of books. Charles was born at Buckingham Palace in London during the reign of his maternal grandfather George VI on 14 November 1948, at 9:14\u00a0pm (GMT),[13][14] the first child of Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and first grandchild of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He was baptised in the palace's Music Room by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, on 15 December 1948.[fn 3] The death of his grandfather and the accession of his mother as Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 made Charles her heir apparent. As the monarch's eldest son, he automatically took the titles Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.[16] Charles attended his mother's coronation at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953.[17] As was customary for upper-class children at the time, a governess, Catherine Peebles, was appointed and undertook his education between the ages of five and eight. Buckingham Palace announced in 1955 that Charles would attend school rather than have a private tutor, making him the first heir apparent to be educated in that manner.[18] On 7 November 1956, Charles commenced classes at Hill House school, in west London.[19] He did not receive preferential treatment from the school's founder and headmaster, Stuart Townend, who advised the Queen to have Charles train in football because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field.[20] Charles then attended two of his father's former schools, Cheam Preparatory School in Berkshire, England,[21] from 1958,[19] followed by Gordonstoun in the north-east of Scotland,[22] beginning classes there in April 1962.[19] Though he reportedly described Gordonstoun, noted for its especially rigorous curriculum, as \"Colditz in kilts\",[21] Charles subsequently praised Gordonstoun, stating it had taught him \"a great deal about myself and my own abilities and disabilities. It taught me to accept challenges and take the initiative.\" In a 1975 interview, he said he was \"glad\" he had attended Gordonstoun and that the \"toughness of the place\" was \"much exaggerated\".[23] He spent two terms in 1966 at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia, during which time he visited Papua New Guinea on a school trip with his history tutor, Michael Collins Persse.[24][25][26] In 1973, Charles described his time at Timbertop as the most enjoyable part of his whole education.[27] Upon his return to Gordonstoun, Charles emulated his father in becoming Head Boy. He left in 1967, with six GCE O-levels and two A-levels in history and French, at grades B and C respectively.[24][28] On his early education, Charles later remarked, \"I didn't enjoy school as much as I might have, but that was only because I'm happier at home than anywhere else.\"[23] Charles broke royal tradition a second time when he proceeded straight to university after his A-levels, rather than joining the British Armed Forces.[21] In October 1967, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read anthropology, archaeology, and history.[29][24] During his second year, Charles attended the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth, studying Welsh history and language for a term.[24] He graduated from Cambridge with a 2:2 Bachelor of Arts on 23 June 1970, the first heir apparent to earn a university degree.[24] On 2 August 1975, he was awarded a Master of Arts degree from Cambridge.[24] (At Cambridge, Master of Arts is an academic rank, not a postgraduate degree.) Charles was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on 26 July 1958,[30][31] though his investiture was not held until 1 July 1969, when he was crowned by his mother in a televised ceremony held at Caernarfon Castle.[32] He took his seat in the House of Lords in 1970,[33][34] and he made his maiden speech in June 1974,[35] the first royal to speak from the floor since the future Edward VII in 1884.[36] He spoke again in 1975.[37] Charles began to take on more public duties, founding The Prince's Trust in 1976,[38] and travelling to the United States in 1981.[39] In the mid-1970s, the prince expressed an interest in serving as Governor-General of Australia, at the suggestion of Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser, but because of a lack of public enthusiasm nothing came of the proposal.[40] Charles accepted the decision, if not without some regret; he said: \"So, what are you supposed to think when you are prepared to do something to help and you are just told you're not wanted?\"[41] Charles is the longest-serving Prince of Wales, having surpassed the record held by Edward VII on 9 September 2017.[3] He is the oldest and longest-serving British heir apparent, the longest-serving Duke of Cornwall, and the longest-serving Duke of Rothesay.[2] If he becomes monarch, he will be the oldest person to do so; the current record holder being William IV, who was 64 when he became king in 1830.[42] Charles served in the Royal Air Force and, following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and two of his great-grandfathers, in the Royal Navy. During his second year at Cambridge, he requested and received Royal Air Force training. On 8\u00a0March 1971, he flew himself to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell to train as a jet pilot.[43] After the passing-out parade that September, he embarked on a naval career and enrolled in a six-week course at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth. He then served on the guided-missile destroyer HMS\u00a0Norfolk (1971\u20131972) and the frigates HMS\u00a0Minerva (1972\u20131973) and HMS\u00a0Jupiter (1974). In 1974, he qualified as a helicopter pilot at RNAS Yeovilton, and then joined 845 Naval Air Squadron, operating from HMS\u00a0Hermes.[44] On 9 February 1976, Charles took command of the coastal minehunter HMS\u00a0Bronington for his last ten months of active service in the navy.[44] He learned to fly on a Chipmunk basic pilot trainer, a BAC Jet Provost jet trainer, and a Beagle Basset multi-engine trainer; he then regularly flew the Hawker Siddeley Andover, Westland Wessex and BAe 146 aircraft of The Queen's Flight[45] until he gave up flying after crashing the BAe 146 in the Hebrides in 1994.[46][47] In his youth, Charles was amorously linked to a number of women. His great-uncle Lord Mountbatten advised him:In a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for\u00a0... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.[48]Charles's girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of Sir John Russell, who was British ambassador to Spain;[49] Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington;[50] Davina Sheffield;[51] Lady Sarah Spencer;[52] and Camilla Shand,[53] who later became his second wife and Duchess of Cornwall.[54] Early in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to Amanda Knatchbull, who was Mountbatten's granddaughter.[55][56] Charles wrote to Amanda's mother\u2014Lady Brabourne, who was also his godmother\u2014expressing interest in her daughter, to which she replied approvingly, though she suggested that a courtship with the not yet 17-year-old girl was premature.[57] Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 tour of India. Both fathers, however, objected; Philip feared that Charles would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British Viceroy and first Governor-General of India), while Lord Brabourne warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.[58] However, in August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was killed by the IRA. When Charles returned, he proposed to Amanda, but in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother Nicholas in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family.[58] In June 1980, Charles officially turned down Chevening House, placed at his disposal since 1974, as his future residence. Chevening, a stately home in Kent, was bequeathed, along with an endowment, to the Crown by the last Earl Stanhope, Amanda's childless great-uncle, in the hope that Charles would eventually occupy it.[59] In 1977, a newspaper report mistakenly announced his engagement to Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg.[60] Charles first met Lady Diana Spencer in 1977 while he was visiting her home, Althorp. He was the companion of her elder sister, Sarah, and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten. Soon, according to Charles's chosen biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, \"without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride\", and she accompanied Charles on visits to Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House.[61] Charles's cousin Norton Knatchbull and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her.[62] Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and paparazzi. When Prince Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.[63] Prince Charles proposed to Diana in February 1981; she accepted and they married in St Paul's Cathedral on 29 July of that year. Upon his marriage, Charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits generated by the Duchy of Cornwall from 50% to 25%.[64] The couple lived at Kensington Palace and at Highgrove House, near Tetbury, and had two children: Princes William (b. 1982) and Henry (known as \"Harry\") (b. 1984). Charles set a precedent by being the first royal father to be present at his children's births.[18] Within five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couple's incompatibility and near 13-year age difference.[65][66] In a videotape recorded by Peter Settelen in 1992, Diana admitted that by 1986, she had been \"deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment.\"[67][68] It is thought she was referring to Barry Mannakee,[69] who was transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986 after his managers had determined that his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate.[68][70] Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles, and Diana commenced one with Major James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor.[71] Charles and Diana's evident discomfort in each other's company led to them being dubbed \"The Glums\" by the press.[72] Diana exposed Charles's affair with Camilla in a book by Andrew Morton, Diana, Her True Story. Audio tapes of her own extramarital flirtations also surfaced.[72] Persistent suggestions that Hewitt is Prince Harry's father have been based on a physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry. However, Harry had already been born by the time Diana's affair with Hewitt began.[73][74] In December 1992, British Prime Minister John Major announced the couple's formal separation in Parliament. Earlier that year, the British press had published transcripts of a passionate bugged telephone conversation between Charles and Camilla from 1989.[75][76] Prince Charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby on 29 June 1994. In the interview, he confirmed his own extramarital affair with Camilla, saying that he had rekindled their association in 1986 only after his marriage to Diana had \"irretrievably broken down\".[77][78][79] Charles and Diana divorced on 28 August 1996.[80] Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August of the following year; Charles flew to Paris with Diana's sisters to accompany her body back to Britain.[81] The engagement of Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was announced on 10 February 2005; he presented her with an engagement ring that had belonged to his grandmother.[82] The Queen's consent to the marriage (as required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772) was recorded in a Privy Council meeting on 2 March.[83] In Canada, the Department of Justice announced its decision that the Queen's Privy Council for Canada was not required to meet to give its consent to the marriage, as the union would not result in offspring and would have no impact on the succession to the Canadian throne.[84] Charles was the only member of the Royal Family to have a civil rather than a church wedding in England. Government documents from the 1950s and 1960s, published by the BBC, stated that such a marriage was illegal,[85] though these were dismissed by Charles's spokesman,[86] and explained to be obsolete by the sitting government.[87] The marriage was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, with a subsequent religious blessing at St George's Chapel. The venue was subsequently changed to Windsor Guildhall, because a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. Four days before the wedding, it was postponed from the originally scheduled date of 8\u00a0April until the following day in order to allow Charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.[88] Charles's parents did not attend the civil marriage ceremony; the Queen's reluctance to attend possibly arose from her position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.[89] The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did attend the service of blessing and later held a reception for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle.[90] The blessing, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, was televised.[91] Since founding The Prince's Trust in 1976, Charles has established 16 more charitable organisations, and now serves as president of all of those.[92] Together, these form a loose alliance called The Prince's Charities, which describes itself as \"the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising over \u00a3100 million annually\u00a0... [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise and international.\"[92] In 2010, The Prince's Charities Canada was established in a similar fashion to its namesake in the UK.[93] Charles is also patron of over 400 other charities and organisations,[94] and carries out duties related to these throughout the Commonwealth realms; for example, he uses his tours of Canada as a way to help draw attention to youth, the disabled, the environment, the arts, medicine, the elderly, heritage conservation, and education.[95] In Canada, Charles has supported humanitarian projects. Along with his two sons, he took part in ceremonies that marked the 1998 International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.[95] Charles has also set up The Prince's Charities Australia, which is based in Melbourne, Victoria. The Prince's Charities Australia is to provide a coordinating presence for the Prince of Wales's Australian and international charitable endeavours[96] Charles was one of the first world leaders to express strong concerns about the human rights record of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, initiating objections in the international arena,[97] and subsequently supported the FARA Foundation,[94] a charity for Romanian orphans and abandoned children.[98] In 2013, Charles donated an unspecified sum of money to the British Red Cross Syria Crisis appeal and DEC Syria appeal, which is run by 14 British charities to help victims of the Syrian civil war.[99][100] According to The Guardian, It is believed that after turning 65 years old in 2013, Charles donated his state pension to an unnamed charity that supports elderly people.[101] In March 2014, Charles arranged for five million measles-rubella vaccinations for children in the Philippines on the outbreak of measles in South-East Asia. According to Clarence House, Charles was affected by news of the damage caused by Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. International Health Partners, of which he has been Patron since 2004, sent the vaccines, which are believed to protect five million children below the age of five from measles.[102][103] In January 2020, the Prince of Wales became the first British patron of the International Rescue Committee, a charity which aims to help refugees and those displaced by war, persecution, or natural disaster.[104] The Prince of Wales has openly expressed his views on architecture and urban planning; he fostered the advancement of New Classical Architecture and asserted that he \"care[s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life.\"[105][106] In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) on 30 May 1984, he memorably described a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend\" and deplored the \"glass stumps and concrete towers\" of modern architecture.[107] He asserted that \"it is possible, and important in human terms, to respect old buildings, street plans and traditional scales and at the same time not to feel guilty about a preference for facades, ornaments and soft materials,\"[107] called for local community involvement in architectural choices, and asked: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Why can't we have those curves and arches that express feeling in design? What is wrong with them? Why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right angles \u2013 and functional?[107] His book and BBC documentary A Vision of Britain (1987) was also critical of modern architecture, and he has continued to campaign for traditional urbanism, human scale, restoration of historic buildings, and sustainable design,[108] despite criticism in the press. Two of his charities (The Prince's Regeneration Trust and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community) promote his views, and the village of Poundbury was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall to a master plan by L\u00e9on Krier under the guidance of Prince Charles and in line with his philosophy.[105] Charles helped establish a national trust for the built environment in Canada after lamenting, in 1996, the unbridled destruction of many of the country's historic urban cores. He offered his assistance to the Department of Canadian Heritage in creating a trust modelled on Britain's National Trust, a plan that was implemented with the passage of the 2007 Canadian federal budget.[109] In 1999, the Prince agreed to the use of his title for the Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership, awarded by the Heritage Canada Foundation to municipal governments that have shown sustained commitment to the conservation of historic places.[110] While visiting the United States and surveying the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, Charles received the National Building Museum's Vincent Scully Prize in 2005, for his efforts in regard to architecture; he donated $25,000 of the prize money towards restoring storm-damaged communities.[111][112] From 1997, the Prince of Wales has visited Romania to view and highlight the destruction of Orthodox monasteries and Transylvanian Saxon villages during the Communist rule of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu.[113][114][115] Charles is patron of the Mihai Eminescu Trust, a Romanian conservation and regeneration organisation,[116] and has purchased a house in Romania.[117] Historian Tom Gallagher wrote in the Romanian newspaper Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103 in 2006 that Charles had been offered the Romanian throne by monarchists in that country; an offer that was reportedly turned down,[118] but Buckingham Palace denied the reports.[119] Charles also has \"a deep understanding of Islamic art and architecture\", and has been involved in the construction of a building and garden at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies that combine Islamic and Oxford architectural styles.[120] Charles has occasionally intervened in projects that employ architectural styles such as modernism and functionalism.[121][122][123] In 2009, Charles wrote to the Qatari royal family, the developers of the Chelsea Barracks site, labelling Lord Rogers's design for the site \"unsuitable\". Subsequently, Rogers was removed from the project and The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment was appointed to propose an alternative.[124] Rogers claimed the Prince had also intervened to block his designs for the Royal Opera House and Paternoster Square, and condemned Charles's actions as \"an abuse of power\" and \"unconstitutional\".[124] Lord Foster, Zaha Hadid, Jacques Herzog, Jean Nouvel, Renzo Piano, and Frank Gehry, among others, wrote a letter to The Sunday Times complaining that the Prince's \"private comments\" and \"behind-the-scenes lobbying\" subverted the \"open and democratic planning process\".[125] Piers Gough and other architects condemned Charles's views as \"elitist\" in a letter encouraging colleagues to boycott a speech given by Charles to RIBA in 2009.[121][123] In 2010, The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment decided to help reconstruct and redesign buildings in Port-au-Prince, Haiti after the capital was destroyed by the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[126] The foundation is known for refurbishing historic buildings in Kabul, Afghanistan and in Kingston, Jamaica. The project has been called the \"biggest challenge yet\" for the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment.[127] For his work as patron of New Classical Architecture, in 2012 he was awarded the Driehaus Architecture Prize for patronage. The prize, awarded by the University of Notre Dame, is considered the highest architecture award for New Classical Architecture and urban planning.[128] The Worshipful Company of Carpenters installed Charles as an Honorary Liveryman \"in recognition of his interest in London's architecture.\"[129] The Prince of Wales is also Permanent Master of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights, a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Drapers, an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians, an Honorary Member of the Court of Assistants of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, and a Royal Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Gardeners.[130] Since the early 1980s, Charles has promoted environmental awareness.[131] Upon moving into Highgrove House, he developed an interest in organic farming, which culminated in the 1990 launch of his own organic brand, Duchy Originals,[132] which now sells more than 200 different sustainably produced products, from food to garden furniture; the profits (over \u00a36\u00a0million by 2010) are donated to The Prince's Charities.[132][133] Documenting work on his estate, Charles co-authored (with Charles Clover, environment editor of The Daily Telegraph) Highgrove: An Experiment in Organic Gardening and Farming, published in 1993, and offers his patronage to Garden Organic. Along similar lines, the Prince of Wales became involved with farming and various industries within it, regularly meeting with farmers to discuss their trade. Although the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic in England prevented Charles from visiting organic farms in Saskatchewan, he met the farmers at Assiniboia town hall.[134][135] In 2004, he founded the Mutton Renaissance Campaign, which aims to support British sheep farmers and make mutton more attractive to Britons.[136] His organic farming has attracted media criticism: According to The Independent in October 2006, \"the story of Duchy Originals has involved compromises and ethical blips, wedded to a determined merchandising programme.\"[137] In 2007, he received the 10th annual Global Environmental Citizen Award from the Harvard Medical School's Center for Health and the Global Environment, the director of which, Eric Chivian, stated: \"For decades the Prince of Wales has been a champion of the natural world\u00a0... He has been a world leader in efforts to improve energy efficiency and in reducing the discharge of toxic substances on land, and into the air and the oceans\".[138] Charles's travels by private jet drew criticism from Plane Stupid's Joss Garman.[139][140] In 2007, Charles launched The Prince's May Day Network, which encourages businesses to take action on climate change. Speaking to the European Parliament on 14 February 2008, he called for European Union leadership in the war against climate change. During the standing ovation that followed, Nigel Farage, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), remained seated and went on to describe Charles's advisers as \"naive and foolish at best.\"[141] In a speech to the Low Carbon Prosperity Summit in a European Parliament chamber on 9 February 2011, Charles said that climate change sceptics are playing \"a reckless game of roulette\" with the planet's future and are having a \"corrosive effect\" on public opinion. He also articulated the need to protect fisheries and the Amazon rain forest, and to make low-carbon emissions affordable and competitive.[142] In 2011, Charles received the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Medal for his engagement with the environment, such as the conservation of rainforests.[143] On 27 August 2012, the Prince of Wales addressed the International Union for Conservation of Nature \u2013 World Conservation Congress, supporting the view that grazing animals are needed to keep soils and grassland productive: I have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called Allan Savory, in Zimbabwe and other semi arid areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive. Such that, if you take grazers off the land and lock them away in vast feedlots, the land dies.[144]In February 2014, Charles visited the Somerset levels to meet residents affected by winter flooding. During his visit, Charles remarked that \"There's nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something. The tragedy is that nothing happened for so long.\" He pledged a \u00a350,000 donation, provided by the Prince's Countryside Fund, to help families and businesses.[145][146][147] In August 2019, it was announced that the Prince of Wales had collaborated with British fashion designers Vin and Omi to produce a line of clothing made out of nettles found in his Highgrove estate. Nettles are a type of plants which are usually \"perceived to have no value\". The Highgrove plant waste was also used to create the jewellery worn with the dresses.[148] Charles has controversially championed alternative medicine.[149] The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health attracted opposition from the scientific and medical community over its campaign encouraging general practitioners to offer herbal and other alternative treatments to National Health Service patients,[150][151] and in May 2006, Charles made a speech at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, urging the integration of conventional and alternative medicine and arguing for homeopathy.[152][8] In April 2008, The Times published a letter from Edzard Ernst, Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, which asked the Prince's Foundation to recall two guides promoting alternative medicine, saying \"the majority of alternative therapies appear to be clinically ineffective, and many are downright dangerous.\" A speaker for the foundation countered the criticism by stating: \"We entirely reject the accusation that our online publication Complementary Healthcare: A Guide contains any misleading or inaccurate claims about the benefits of complementary therapies. On the contrary, it treats people as adults and takes a responsible approach by encouraging people to look at reliable sources of information\u00a0... so that they can make informed decisions. The foundation does not promote complementary therapies.\"[153] That year, Ernst published a book with Simon Singh, mockingly dedicated to \"HRH the Prince of Wales\" called Trick or Treatment: Alternative Medicine on Trial. The last chapter is highly critical of Charles's advocacy of complementary and alternative treatments.[154] The Prince's Duchy Originals produce a variety of complementary medicinal products including a \"Detox Tincture\" that Edzard Ernst has denounced as \"financially exploiting the vulnerable\" and \"outright quackery\".[155] In 2009, the Advertising Standards Authority criticised an email that Duchy Originals had sent out to advertise its Echina-Relief, Hyperi-Lift and Detox Tinctures products saying that it was misleading.[155] The Prince personally wrote at least seven letters[156] to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) shortly before they relaxed the rules governing labelling of such herbal products, a move that has been widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies.[157] In October 2009, it was reported that Charles had personally lobbied the Health Secretary, Andy Burnham, regarding greater provision of alternative treatments in the NHS.[155] In 2016, Charles said in a speech that he used homeopathic veterinary medicines to reduce antibiotic use at his farm.[158] In Ernst's book More Good Than Harm? The Moral Maze of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, he and ethicist Kevin Smith call Charles \"foolish and immoral\", and \"conclude that it is not possible to practice alternative medicine ethically\". Ernst further claims that the private secretary of the Prince contacted the vice chancellor of Exeter University to investigate Ernst's complaints against the \"Smallwood Report\", which the Prince had commissioned in 2005. While Ernst was \"found not to be guilty of any wrong-doing, all local support at Exeter stopped, which eventually led to my early retirement.\"[159] In April 2010, following accounting irregularities, a former official at the foundation and his wife were arrested for fraud believed to total \u00a3300,000.[160] Four days later, the foundation announced its closure, claiming that it \"has achieved its key objective of promoting the use of integrated health.\"[161] The charity's finance director, accountant George Gray, was convicted of theft totalling \u00a3253,000 and sentenced to three years in prison.[162] The Prince's Foundation was re-branded and re-launched later in 2010 as The College of Medicine.[162][163][164] Prince Charles was confirmed at age 16 by Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey at Easter 1965, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[165] He attends services at various Anglican churches close to Highgrove,[166] and attends the Church of Scotland's Crathie Kirk with the rest of the royal family when staying at Balmoral Castle. In 2000, he was appointed as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Charles has visited (amid some secrecy) Orthodox monasteries several times on Mount Athos[167] as well as in Romania.[113] Charles is also patron of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies at the University of Oxford, and in the 2000s, he inaugurated the Markfield Institute of Higher Education, which is dedicated to Islamic studies in a plural multicultural context.[120][168][169] Sir Laurens van der Post became a friend of Charles in 1977; he was dubbed his \"spiritual guru\" and was godfather to Charles's son, Prince William.[170] From van der Post, Prince Charles developed a focus on philosophy, especially that of Asian and Middle Eastern nations.[citation needed] Charles expressed his philosophical views in his 2010 book, Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,[171][172][173] which won a Nautilus Book Award.[174] Although it had been rumoured that Charles would vow to be \"Defender of the Faiths\" or \"Defender of Faith\" as king, he stated in 2015 that he would retain the monarch's traditional title of \"Defender of the Faith\", whilst \"ensuring that other people's faiths can also be practised\", which he sees as a duty of the Church of England.[175] In January 2020 he visited Jerusalem for the Holocaust ceremonies, and after ceremonial meetings with the Presidents of Israel and of Palestine and other engagements, attended an ecumenical service in the Church of the Nativity and walked accompanied by Christian and Muslim spiritual leaders through the centre of Bethlehem.[citation needed] In 2008, The Daily Telegraph declared Charles the \"hardest-working member of the royal family.\"[176] He carried out 560 official engagements in 2008,[176] 499 in 2010,[177] and over 600 in 2011. As Prince of Wales, Charles undertakes official duties on behalf of the Queen and the Commonwealth realms. He officiates at investitures and attends the funerals of foreign dignitaries.[178] Prince Charles makes regular tours of Wales, fulfilling a week of engagements each summer, and attending important national occasions, such as opening the Senedd.[179] The six trustees of the Royal Collection Trust meet three times a year under his chairmanship.[180] Prince Charles travels abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Charles has been regarded as an effective advocate of the country. In 1983, Christopher John Lewis, who had fired a shot with a .22 rifle at the Queen in 1981, attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Charles, who was visiting New Zealand with Diana and William.[181] While visiting Australia in January 1994, two shots from a starting pistol were fired at him on Australia Day by David Kang in protest of the treatment of several hundred Cambodian asylum seekers held in detention camps.[182][183] In 1995, Charles became the first member of the royal family to visit the Republic of Ireland in an official capacity.[184][185] In 2000, Charles revived the tradition of the Prince of Wales having an official harpist, in order to foster Welsh talent at playing the harp, the national instrument of Wales. He and the Duchess of Cornwall also spend one week each year in Scotland, where he is patron of several Scottish organisations.[186] His service to the Canadian Armed Forces permits him to be informed of troop activities, and allows him to visit these troops while in Canada or overseas, taking part in ceremonial occasions.[187] For instance, in 2001 he placed a specially commissioned wreath, made from vegetation taken from French battlefields, at the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,[188] and in 1981 he became the patron of the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum.[189] At the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Charles unintentionally caused controversy when he shook hands with Robert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe, who had been seated next to him. Charles's office subsequently released a statement saying: \"The Prince of Wales was caught by surprise and not in a position to avoid shaking Mr Mugabe's hand. The Prince finds the current Zimbabwean regime abhorrent. He has supported the Zimbabwe Defence and Aid Fund, which works with those being oppressed by the regime. The Prince also recently met Pius Ncube, the Archbishop of Bulawayo, an outspoken critic of the government.\"[190] In 2010, Charles represented the Queen at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India.[191] He attends official events in the United Kingdom in support of Commonwealth countries, such as the Christchurch earthquake memorial service at Westminster Abbey in 2011.[192][193][194] From 15 to 17 November 2013, he represented the Queen for the first time at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, in Colombo, Sri Lanka.[195][196] Letters sent by Prince Charles to government ministers during 2004 and 2005\u2014the so-called black spider memos\u2014presented potential embarrassment following a challenge by The Guardian newspaper to release the letters under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In March 2015, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom decided that the Prince's letters must be released.[197] The letters were published by the Cabinet Office on 13 May 2015.[198][199][200] Reaction to the memos upon their release was largely supportive of Charles, with little criticism of him.[201] The memos were variously described in the press as \"underwhelming\"[202] and \"harmless\"[203] and that their release had \"backfired on those who seek to belittle him\",[204] with reaction from the public also supportive.[205] The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall made their first joint trip to the Republic of Ireland in May 2015. The trip was called an important step in \"promoting peace and reconciliation\" by the British Embassy.[206] During the trip, Charles shook hands with Sinn F\u00e9in and supposed IRA leader Gerry Adams in Galway, which was described by the media as a \"historic handshake\" and a \"significant moment for Anglo-Irish relations\".[207][208][209] In the run up to the Prince's visit, two Irish republican dissidents were arrested for planning a bomb attack. Semtex and rockets were found at the Dublin home of suspect Donal O'Coisdealbha, member of a self-styled \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann organisation, who was later jailed for five and a half years.[210] He was connected to a veteran republican, Seamus McGrane of County Louth, a member of the Real IRA, who was jailed for 11 and a half years.[211][212] In 2015, it was revealed that Prince Charles had access to confidential UK cabinet papers.[213] Charles has made frequent visits to Saudi Arabia in order to promote arms exports for companies such as BAE Systems. In 2013,[214] 2014,[215] and 2015,[216] he met with the commander of Saudi Arabia's National Guard Mutaib bin Abdullah. In February 2014, he took part in a traditional sword dance with members of the Saudi royal family at the Janariyah festival in Riyadh.[217] At the same festival, British arms company BAE Systems was honoured by Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz.[218] Charles was criticised by Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier in 2016 over his role in the sale of Typhoon fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.[219] According to Charles's biographer Catherine Mayer, a Time magazine journalist who claims to have interviewed several sources from Prince Charles's inner circle, he \"doesn't like being used to market weaponry\" in deals with Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf states. According to Mayer, Charles has only raised his objections to being used to sell weapons abroad in private.[220] Commonwealth heads of government decided at their 2018 meeting, that the Prince of Wales will be the next Head of the Commonwealth after the Queen. The head is chosen and therefore not hereditary.[221] On 7 March 2019, the Queen hosted a Buckingham Palace event to mark the 50th anniversary of Charles's investiture as the Prince of Wales. Guests at the event included the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prime Minister Theresa May and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford.[222] The same month, at the request of the British government, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall went on an official tour to Cuba, making them the first British royalty to visit the country. The tour was seen as effort to form a closer relationship between the UK and Cuba.[223] From his youth until 1992, Prince Charles was an avid player of competitive polo. He continued to play informally, including for charity, until 2005.[224] Charles also frequently took part in fox hunting until the sport was banned in the United Kingdom in 2005. By the late 1990s, opposition to the activity was growing when Charles's participation was viewed as a \"political statement\" by those who were opposed to it. The League Against Cruel Sports launched an attack against Charles after he took his sons on the Beaufort Hunt in 1999. At that time, the government was trying to ban hunting with hounds.[225][226] Charles has been a keen salmon angler since youth and supports Orri Vigf\u00fasson's efforts to protect the North Atlantic salmon. He frequently fishes the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, while he claims his most special angling memories are from his time in Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, Iceland.[227] Charles is a supporter of Burnley Football Club.[228] Prince Charles is president or patron of more than 20 performing arts organisations, which include the Royal College of Music, the Royal Opera, the English Chamber Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, Welsh National Opera, and the Purcell School. In 2000, he revived the tradition of appointing harpists to the Royal Court, by appointing an Official Harpist to the Prince of Wales. As an undergraduate at Cambridge he played cello, and has sung with the Bach Choir twice.[229] Charles founded The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts in 2002, to help more children experience the arts first-hand. He is president of the Royal Shakespeare Company and attends performances in Stratford-Upon-Avon, supports fundraising events and attends the company's annual general meeting.[229] He enjoys comedy,[230] and is interested in illusionism, becoming a member of The Magic Circle after passing his audition in 1975 by performing the \"cups and balls\" effect.[231] Charles is a keen and accomplished watercolourist who has exhibited and sold a number of his works and also published books on the subject. In 2001, 20 lithographs of his watercolour paintings illustrating his country estates were exhibited at the Florence International Biennale of Contemporary Art.[232] He is Honorary President of the Royal Academy of Arts Development Trust.[233] Charles was awarded the 2011 Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award by the Montblanc Cultural Foundation for his support and commitment to the arts, particularly in regard to young people.[234] On 23 April 2016, Charles appeared in a comedy sketch for the Royal Shakespeare Company's Shakespeare Live! at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's death in 1616. The event was televised live by the BBC. Charles made a surprise entrance to settle the disputed delivery of Hamlet's celebrated line, \"To be or not to be, that is the question\".[235] Prince Charles is an author of several books that reflect his own interests. He has also contributed a foreword or preface to books by other writers and has also written, presented and has been featured in documentary films.[236][237][238][239] Since his birth, Prince Charles has undergone close media attention, which increased as he matured. It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and its aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king, such as the 2014 play King Charles III.[240] Described as the \"world's most eligible bachelor\" in the late 1970s,[241] Prince Charles was subsequently overshadowed by Diana. After her death, the media regularly breached Charles's privacy and printed expos\u00e9s. In 2006, the prince filed a court case against the Mail on Sunday, after excerpts of his personal journals were published, revealing his opinions on matters such as the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997, in which Charles described the Chinese government officials as \"appalling old waxworks\".[242] Mark Bolland, his ex-private secretary, declared in a statement to the High Court that Charles \"would readily embrace the political aspects of any contentious issue he was interested in\u00a0... He carried it out in a very considered, thoughtful and researched way. He often referred to himself as a 'dissident' working against the prevailing political consensus.\"[242] Jonathan Dimbleby reported that the prince \"has accumulated a number of certainties about the state of the world and does not relish contradiction.\"[243] Other people who were formerly connected with the prince have betrayed his confidence. An ex-member of his household handed the press an internal memo in which Charles commented on ambition and opportunity, and which was widely interpreted as blaming meritocracy for creating a combative atmosphere in society. Charles responded: \"In my view, it is just as great an achievement to be a plumber or a bricklayer as it is to be a lawyer or a doctor\".[244] Charles's anguish was recorded in his private comments to Prince William, caught on a microphone during a press photo-call in 2005 and published in the national press. After a question from the BBC's royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, Charles muttered: \"These bloody people. I can't bear that man. I mean, he's so awful, he really is.\"[245] In 2002, Charles, \"so often a target of the press, got his chance to return fire\" when addressing \"scores of editors, publishers and other media executives\" gathered at St Bride's Fleet Street to celebrate 300 years of journalism.[246][247] Defending public servants from \"the corrosive drip of constant criticism\", he noted that the press had been \"awkward, cantankerous, cynical, bloody-minded, at times intrusive, at times inaccurate and at times deeply unfair and harmful to individuals and to institutions.\"[247] But, he concluded, regarding his own relations with the press, \"from time to time we are probably both a bit hard on each other, exaggerating the downsides and ignoring the good points in each.\"[247] The Prince of Wales has occasionally appeared on television. In 1984, he read his children's book The Old Man of Lochnagar for the BBC's Jackanory series. The UK soap opera Coronation Street featured an appearance by Charles during the show's 40th anniversary in 2000,[248] as did the New Zealand young adult cartoon series bro'Town (2005), after he attended a performance by the show's creators during a tour of the country.[249][250] Charles was interviewed with Princes William and Harry by Ant & Dec to mark the 30th anniversary of The Prince's Trust in 2006[251] and in 2016 was interviewed by them again along with his sons and the Duchess of Cornwall to mark the 40th anniversary.[252] His saving of the Scottish stately home Dumfries House was the subject of Alan Titchmarsh's documentary Royal Restoration, which aired on TV in May 2012.[253] Also in May 2012, Charles tried his hand at being a weather presenter for the BBC, reporting the forecast for Scotland as part of their annual week at Holyrood Palace alongside Christopher Blanchett. He injected humour in his report, asking, \"Who the hell wrote this script?\" as references were made to royal residences.[254] In December 2015, Channel 4 News revealed that interviews with Charles were subject to a contract that restricts questions to those previously approved, and gives his staff oversight of editing and the right to \"remove the contribution in its entirety from the programme\". Channel 4 News decided not to proceed with an interview on this basis, which some journalists believed would put them at risk of breaching the Ofcom Broadcasting Code on editorial independence and transparency.[255] Clarence House, previously the residence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, is Charles's official London residence.[256] His primary source of income is generated from the Duchy of Cornwall, which owns 133,658 acres of land (around 54,090 hectares), including farming, residential, and commercial properties, as well as an investment portfolio. Highgrove House in Gloucestershire is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, having been purchased for his use in 1980, and which Prince Charles rents for \u00a3336,000 per annum.[257] The Public Accounts Committee published its 25th report into the Duchy of Cornwall accounts in November 2013 noting that the duchy performed well in 2012\u201313, increasing its total income and producing an overall surplus of \u00a319.1 million.[258] In 2007, the prince purchased a 192-acre property (150 acres of grazing and parkland, and 40 acres of woodland) in Carmarthenshire, and applied for permission to convert the farm into a Welsh home for him and the Duchess of Cornwall, to be rented out as holiday flats when the couple is not in residence.[259] A neighbouring family said the proposals flouted local planning regulations, and the application was put on hold temporarily while a report was drafted on how the alterations would affect the local bat population.[260] Charles and Camilla first stayed at the new property, called Llwynywermod, in June 2008.[261] In 2016, it was reported that his estates receive \u00a3100,000 a year in European Union agricultural subsidies.[262] Starting in 1993, the Prince of Wales has paid tax voluntarily under the Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation, updated 2013.[263] In December 2012, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs were asked to investigate alleged tax avoidance by the Duchy of Cornwall.[264] The Duchy of Cornwall is named in the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment that were leaked to the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. The papers show that the Duchy invested in a Bermuda-based carbon credits trading company run by one of Charles's Cambridge contemporaries. The investment was kept secret but there is no suggestion that Charles or the estate avoided UK tax.[265] The Prince's full title is: His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, KG, KT, GCB, OM, AK, QSO, CC, PC, ADC, Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.[266][267] Charles has held titles throughout his life: the grandson of the monarch, the son of the monarch and in his own right. He has been a British prince since birth and was created Prince of Wales in 1958.[fn 4] There has been speculation as to what regnal name the prince would choose upon his succession to the throne. If he uses his first name, he would be known as Charles III. However, it was reported in 2005 that Charles has suggested he may choose to reign as George VII in honour of his maternal grandfather, and to avoid association with the Stuart kings Charles I (who was beheaded) and Charles\u00a0II (who was known for his promiscuous lifestyle),[269] as well as to be sensitive to the memory of Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was called \"Charles III\" by his supporters.[269] Charles's office responded that \"no decision has been made\".[270] Charles has held substantive ranks in the armed forces of a number of countries since he was made a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force in 1972. Charles's first honorary appointment in the armed forces was as Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Regiment of Wales in 1969; since then, the prince has also been installed as Colonel-in-Chief, Colonel, Honorary Air Commodore, Air Commodore-in-Chief, Deputy Colonel-in-Chief, Royal Honorary Colonel, Royal Colonel, and Honorary Commodore of at least 32 military formations throughout the Commonwealth, including the Royal Gurkha Rifles, which is the only foreign regiment in the British army.[271] Since 2009, Charles holds the second-highest ranks in all three branches of the Canadian Forces and, on 16 June 2012, the Queen awarded the Prince of Wales honorary five-star rank in all three branches of the British Armed Forces, \"to acknowledge his support in her role as Commander-in-Chief\", installing him as Admiral of the Fleet, Field Marshal and Marshal of the Royal Air Force.[272][273][274] He has been inducted into seven orders and received eight decorations from the Commonwealth realms, and has been the recipient of 20 different honours from foreign states, as well as nine honorary degrees from universities in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The banners used by the prince vary depending upon location. His Personal Standard is the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom differenced as in his arms with a label of three points Argent, and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre. It is used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when the prince is acting in an official capacity associated with the UK Armed Forces.[275] The personal flag for use in Wales is based upon the Royal Badge of Wales (the historic arms of the Kingdom of Gwynedd), which consist of four quadrants, the first and fourth with a red lion on a gold field, and the second and third with a gold lion on a red field. Superimposed is an escutcheon Vert bearing the single-arched coronet of the Prince of Wales.[275] In Scotland the personal banner used since 1974 is based upon three ancient Scottish titles: Duke of Rothesay (heir apparent to the King of Scots), High Steward of Scotland and Lord of the Isles. The flag is divided into four quadrants like the arms of the Chief of Clan Stewart of Appin; the first and fourth quadrants comprise a gold field with a blue and silver checkered band in the centre; the second and third quadrants display a black galley on a silver field. The arms are differenced from those of Appin by the addition of an inescutcheon bearing the tressured lion rampant of Scotland; defaced by a plain label of three points Azure to indicate the heir apparent.[275] In Cornwall, the banner is the arms of the Duke of Cornwall: \"Sable 15 bezants Or\", that is, a black field bearing 15 gold coins.[275] In 2011, the Canadian Heraldic Authority introduced a personal heraldic banner for the Prince of Wales for use in Canada, consisting of the shield of the Arms of Canada defaced with both a blue roundel of the Prince of Wales's feathers surrounded by a wreath of gold maple leaves, and a white label of three points.[276] Banner of arms Standard for Wales Standard for Scotland Banner of arms of the Duke of Cornwall Standard of the Prince of Wales for personal use in Canada",

He has been Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay since 1952, and he is the oldest and longest-serving heir apparent in British history.[2] He is also the longest-serving Prince of Wales, having held that title since 1958.[3]\nCharles was born at Buckingham Palace as the first grandchild of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He was educated at Cheam and Gordonstoun schools, which his father, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, had attended as a child. Charles also spent a year at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge, Charles served in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976. In 1981, he married Lady Diana Spencer, and they had two sons: Prince William (b. 1982) and Prince Harry (b. 1984). In 1996, the couple divorced following well-publicised extramarital affairs by both parties. Diana died as the result of a car crash in Paris the following year. In 2005, Charles married long-time partner Camilla Parker Bowles.\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles undertakes official duties on behalf of the Queen and the Commonwealth realms. Charles founded The Prince's Trust in 1976, sponsors The Prince's Charities, and is a patron, president, and a member of over 400 other charities and organisations. As an environmentalist, he raises awareness of organic farming and climate change, which has earned him awards and recognition from environmental groups.[4][5][6][7] His support for alternative medicine, including homeopathy, has been criticised by some in the medical community,[8][9] and his views on the role of architecture in society and the conservation of historic buildings have received considerable attention from British architects and design critics.[10][11][12] Since 1993, Charles has worked on the creation of Poundbury, an experimental new town based on his preferences. He is also an author and co-author of a number of books.\nCharles was born at Buckingham Palace in London during the reign of his maternal grandfather George VI on 14 November 1948, at 9:14\u00a0pm (GMT),[13][14] the first child of Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and first grandchild of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He was baptised in the palace's Music Room by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, on 15 December 1948.[fn 3]\nThe death of his grandfather and the accession of his mother as Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 made Charles her heir apparent. As the monarch's eldest son, he automatically took the titles Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.[16] Charles attended his mother's coronation at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953.[17]\nAs was customary for upper-class children at the time, a governess, Catherine Peebles, was appointed and undertook his education between the ages of five and eight. Buckingham Palace announced in 1955 that Charles would attend school rather than have a private tutor, making him the first heir apparent to be educated in that manner.[18] On 7 November 1956, Charles commenced classes at Hill House school, in west London.[19] He did not receive preferential treatment from the school's founder and headmaster, Stuart Townend, who advised the Queen to have Charles train in football because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field.[20] Charles then attended two of his father's former schools, Cheam Preparatory School in Berkshire, England,[21] from 1958,[19] followed by Gordonstoun in the north-east of Scotland,[22] beginning classes there in April 1962.[19] Though he reportedly described Gordonstoun, noted for its especially rigorous curriculum, as \"Colditz in kilts\",[21] Charles subsequently praised Gordonstoun, stating it had taught him \"a great deal about myself and my own abilities and disabilities. It taught me to accept challenges and take the initiative.\" In a 1975 interview, he said he was \"glad\" he had attended Gordonstoun and that the \"toughness of the place\" was \"much exaggerated\".[23] He spent two terms in 1966 at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia, during which time he visited Papua New Guinea on a school trip with his history tutor, Michael Collins Persse.[24][25][26] In 1973, Charles described his time at Timbertop as the most enjoyable part of his whole education.[27] Upon his return to Gordonstoun, Charles emulated his father in becoming Head Boy. He left in 1967, with six GCE O-levels and two A-levels in history and French, at grades B and C respectively.[24][28] On his early education, Charles later remarked, \"I didn't enjoy school as much as I might have, but that was only because I'm happier at home than anywhere else.\"[23]\nCharles broke royal tradition a second time when he proceeded straight to university after his A-levels, rather than joining the British Armed Forces.[21] In October 1967, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read anthropology, archaeology, and history.[29][24] During his second year, Charles attended the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth, studying Welsh history and language for a term.[24] He graduated from Cambridge with a 2:2 Bachelor of Arts on 23 June 1970, the first heir apparent to earn a university degree.[24] On 2 August 1975, he was awarded a Master of Arts degree from Cambridge.[24] (At Cambridge, Master of Arts is an academic rank, not a postgraduate degree.)\nCharles was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on 26 July 1958,[30][31] though his investiture was not held until 1 July 1969, when he was crowned by his mother in a televised ceremony held at Caernarfon Castle.[32] He took his seat in the House of Lords in 1970,[33][34] and he made his maiden speech in June 1974,[35] the first royal to speak from the floor since the future Edward VII in 1884.[36] He spoke again in 1975.[37] Charles began to take on more public duties, founding The Prince's Trust in 1976,[38] and travelling to the United States in 1981.[39] In the mid-1970s, the prince expressed an interest in serving as Governor-General of Australia, at the suggestion of Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser, but because of a lack of public enthusiasm nothing came of the proposal.[40] Charles accepted the decision, if not without some regret; he said: \"So, what are you supposed to think when you are prepared to do something to help and you are just told you're not wanted?\"[41]\nCharles is the longest-serving Prince of Wales, having surpassed the record held by Edward VII on 9 September 2017.[3] He is the oldest and longest-serving British heir apparent, the longest-serving Duke of Cornwall, and the longest-serving Duke of Rothesay.[2] If he becomes monarch, he will be the oldest person to do so; the current record holder being William IV, who was 64 when he became king in 1830.[42]\nCharles served in the Royal Air Force and, following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and two of his great-grandfathers, in the Royal Navy. During his second year at Cambridge, he requested and received Royal Air Force training. On 8\u00a0March 1971, he flew himself to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell to train as a jet pilot.[43] After the passing-out parade that September, he embarked on a naval career and enrolled in a six-week course at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth. He then served on the guided-missile destroyer HMS\u00a0Norfolk (1971\u20131972) and the frigates HMS\u00a0Minerva (1972\u20131973) and HMS\u00a0Jupiter (1974). In 1974, he qualified as a helicopter pilot at RNAS Yeovilton, and then joined 845 Naval Air Squadron, operating from HMS\u00a0Hermes.[44]\nOn 9 February 1976, Charles took command of the coastal minehunter HMS\u00a0Bronington for his last ten months of active service in the navy.[44] He learned to fly on a Chipmunk basic pilot trainer, a BAC Jet Provost jet trainer, and a Beagle Basset multi-engine trainer; he then regularly flew the Hawker Siddeley Andover, Westland Wessex and BAe 146 aircraft of The Queen's Flight[45] until he gave up flying after crashing the BAe 146 in the Hebrides in 1994.[46][47]\n\nIn his youth, Charles was amorously linked to a number of women. His great-uncle Lord Mountbatten advised him:In a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for\u00a0... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.[48]Charles's girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of Sir John Russell, who was British ambassador to Spain;[49] Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington;[50] Davina Sheffield;[51] Lady Sarah Spencer;[52] and Camilla Shand,[53] who later became his second wife and Duchess of Cornwall.[54]\nEarly in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to Amanda Knatchbull, who was Mountbatten's granddaughter.[55][56] Charles wrote to Amanda's mother\u2014Lady Brabourne, who was also his godmother\u2014expressing interest in her daughter, to which she replied approvingly, though she suggested that a courtship with the not yet 17-year-old girl was premature.[57] Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 tour of India. Both fathers, however, objected; Philip feared that Charles would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British Viceroy and first Governor-General of India), while Lord Brabourne warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.[58] However, in August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was killed by the IRA. When Charles returned, he proposed to Amanda, but in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother Nicholas in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family.[58] In June 1980, Charles officially turned down Chevening House, placed at his disposal since 1974, as his future residence. Chevening, a stately home in Kent, was bequeathed, along with an endowment, to the Crown by the last Earl Stanhope, Amanda's childless great-uncle, in the hope that Charles would eventually occupy it.[59] In 1977, a newspaper report mistakenly announced his engagement to Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg.[60]\nCharles first met Lady Diana Spencer in 1977 while he was visiting her home, Althorp. He was the companion of her elder sister, Sarah, and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten. Soon, according to Charles's chosen biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, \"without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride\", and she accompanied Charles on visits to Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House.[61]\nCharles's cousin Norton Knatchbull and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her.[62] Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and paparazzi. When Prince Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.[63]\nPrince Charles proposed to Diana in February 1981; she accepted and they married in St Paul's Cathedral on 29 July of that year. Upon his marriage, Charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits generated by the Duchy of Cornwall from 50% to 25%.[64] The couple lived at Kensington Palace and at Highgrove House, near Tetbury, and had two children: Princes William (b. 1982) and Henry (known as \"Harry\") (b. 1984). Charles set a precedent by being the first royal father to be present at his children's births.[18]\nWithin five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couple's incompatibility and near 13-year age difference.[65][66] In a videotape recorded by Peter Settelen in 1992, Diana admitted that by 1986, she had been \"deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment.\"[67][68] It is thought she was referring to Barry Mannakee,[69] who was transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986 after his managers had determined that his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate.[68][70] Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles, and Diana commenced one with Major James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor.[71] Charles and Diana's evident discomfort in each other's company led to them being dubbed \"The Glums\" by the press.[72] Diana exposed Charles's affair with Camilla in a book by Andrew Morton, Diana, Her True Story. Audio tapes of her own extramarital flirtations also surfaced.[72] Persistent suggestions that Hewitt is Prince Harry's father have been based on a physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry. However, Harry had already been born by the time Diana's affair with Hewitt began.[73][74]\nIn December 1992, British Prime Minister John Major announced the couple's formal separation in Parliament. Earlier that year, the British press had published transcripts of a passionate bugged telephone conversation between Charles and Camilla from 1989.[75][76] Prince Charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby on 29 June 1994. In the interview, he confirmed his own extramarital affair with Camilla, saying that he had rekindled their association in 1986 only after his marriage to Diana had \"irretrievably broken down\".[77][78][79] Charles and Diana divorced on 28 August 1996.[80] Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August of the following year; Charles flew to Paris with Diana's sisters to accompany her body back to Britain.[81]\nThe engagement of Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was announced on 10 February 2005; he presented her with an engagement ring that had belonged to his grandmother.[82] The Queen's consent to the marriage (as required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772) was recorded in a Privy Council meeting on 2 March.[83] In Canada, the Department of Justice announced its decision that the Queen's Privy Council for Canada was not required to meet to give its consent to the marriage, as the union would not result in offspring and would have no impact on the succession to the Canadian throne.[84]\nCharles was the only member of the Royal Family to have a civil rather than a church wedding in England. Government documents from the 1950s and 1960s, published by the BBC, stated that such a marriage was illegal,[85] though these were dismissed by Charles's spokesman,[86] and explained to be obsolete by the sitting government.[87]\nThe marriage was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, with a subsequent religious blessing at St George's Chapel. The venue was subsequently changed to Windsor Guildhall, because a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. Four days before the wedding, it was postponed from the originally scheduled date of 8\u00a0April until the following day in order to allow Charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.[88]\nCharles's parents did not attend the civil marriage ceremony; the Queen's reluctance to attend possibly arose from her position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.[89] The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did attend the service of blessing and later held a reception for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle.[90] The blessing, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, was televised.[91]\nSince founding The Prince's Trust in 1976, Charles has established 16 more charitable organisations, and now serves as president of all of those.[92] Together, these form a loose alliance called The Prince's Charities, which describes itself as \"the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising over \u00a3100 million annually\u00a0... [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise and international.\"[92]\nIn 2010, The Prince's Charities Canada was established in a similar fashion to its namesake in the UK.[93] Charles is also patron of over 400 other charities and organisations,[94] and carries out duties related to these throughout the Commonwealth realms; for example, he uses his tours of Canada as a way to help draw attention to youth, the disabled, the environment, the arts, medicine, the elderly, heritage conservation, and education.[95] In Canada, Charles has supported humanitarian projects. Along with his two sons, he took part in ceremonies that marked the 1998 International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.[95] Charles has also set up The Prince's Charities Australia, which is based in Melbourne, Victoria. The Prince's Charities Australia is to provide a coordinating presence for the Prince of Wales's Australian and international charitable endeavours[96]\nCharles was one of the first world leaders to express strong concerns about the human rights record of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, initiating objections in the international arena,[97] and subsequently supported the FARA Foundation,[94] a charity for Romanian orphans and abandoned children.[98]\nIn 2013, Charles donated an unspecified sum of money to the British Red Cross Syria Crisis appeal and DEC Syria appeal, which is run by 14 British charities to help victims of the Syrian civil war.[99][100] According to The Guardian, It is believed that after turning 65 years old in 2013, Charles donated his state pension to an unnamed charity that supports elderly people.[101] In March 2014, Charles arranged for five million measles-rubella vaccinations for children in the Philippines on the outbreak of measles in South-East Asia. According to Clarence House, Charles was affected by news of the damage caused by Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. International Health Partners, of which he has been Patron since 2004, sent the vaccines, which are believed to protect five million children below the age of five from measles.[102][103]\nIn January 2020, the Prince of Wales became the first British patron of the International Rescue Committee, a charity which aims to help refugees and those displaced by war, persecution, or natural disaster.[104]\n\nThe Prince of Wales has openly expressed his views on architecture and urban planning; he fostered the advancement of New Classical Architecture and asserted that he \"care[s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life.\"[105][106] In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) on 30 May 1984, he memorably described a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend\" and deplored the \"glass stumps and concrete towers\" of modern architecture.[107] He asserted that \"it is possible, and important in human terms, to respect old buildings, street plans and traditional scales and at the same time not to feel guilty about a preference for facades, ornaments and soft materials,\"[107] called for local community involvement in architectural choices, and asked: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Why can't we have those curves and arches that express feeling in design? What is wrong with them? Why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right angles \u2013 and functional?[107]\nHis book and BBC documentary A Vision of Britain (1987) was also critical of modern architecture, and he has continued to campaign for traditional urbanism, human scale, restoration of historic buildings, and sustainable design,[108] despite criticism in the press. Two of his charities (The Prince's Regeneration Trust and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community) promote his views, and the village of Poundbury was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall to a master plan by L\u00e9on Krier under the guidance of Prince Charles and in line with his philosophy.[105]\nCharles helped establish a national trust for the built environment in Canada after lamenting, in 1996, the unbridled destruction of many of the country's historic urban cores. He offered his assistance to the Department of Canadian Heritage in creating a trust modelled on Britain's National Trust, a plan that was implemented with the passage of the 2007 Canadian federal budget.[109] In 1999, the Prince agreed to the use of his title for the Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership, awarded by the Heritage Canada Foundation to municipal governments that have shown sustained commitment to the conservation of historic places.[110] While visiting the United States and surveying the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, Charles received the National Building Museum's Vincent Scully Prize in 2005, for his efforts in regard to architecture; he donated $25,000 of the prize money towards restoring storm-damaged communities.[111][112]\nFrom 1997, the Prince of Wales has visited Romania to view and highlight the destruction of Orthodox monasteries and Transylvanian Saxon villages during the Communist rule of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu.[113][114][115] Charles is patron of the Mihai Eminescu Trust, a Romanian conservation and regeneration organisation,[116] and has purchased a house in Romania.[117] Historian Tom Gallagher wrote in the Romanian newspaper Rom\u00e2nia Liber\u0103 in 2006 that Charles had been offered the Romanian throne by monarchists in that country; an offer that was reportedly turned down,[118] but Buckingham Palace denied the reports.[119] Charles also has \"a deep understanding of Islamic art and architecture\", and has been involved in the construction of a building and garden at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies that combine Islamic and Oxford architectural styles.[120]\nCharles has occasionally intervened in projects that employ architectural styles such as modernism and functionalism.[121][122][123] In 2009, Charles wrote to the Qatari royal family, the developers of the Chelsea Barracks site, labelling Lord Rogers's design for the site \"unsuitable\". Subsequently, Rogers was removed from the project and The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment was appointed to propose an alternative.[124] Rogers claimed the Prince had also intervened to block his designs for the Royal Opera House and Paternoster Square, and condemned Charles's actions as \"an abuse of power\" and \"unconstitutional\".[124] Lord Foster, Zaha Hadid, Jacques Herzog, Jean Nouvel, Renzo Piano, and Frank Gehry, among others, wrote a letter to The Sunday Times complaining that the Prince's \"private comments\" and \"behind-the-scenes lobbying\" subverted the \"open and democratic planning process\".[125] Piers Gough and other architects condemned Charles's views as \"elitist\" in a letter encouraging colleagues to boycott a speech given by Charles to RIBA in 2009.[121][123]\nIn 2010, The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment decided to help reconstruct and redesign buildings in Port-au-Prince, Haiti after the capital was destroyed by the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[126] The foundation is known for refurbishing historic buildings in Kabul, Afghanistan and in Kingston, Jamaica. The project has been called the \"biggest challenge yet\" for the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment.[127] For his work as patron of New Classical Architecture, in 2012 he was awarded the Driehaus Architecture Prize for patronage. The prize, awarded by the University of Notre Dame, is considered the highest architecture award for New Classical Architecture and urban planning.[128]\nThe Worshipful Company of Carpenters installed Charles as an Honorary Liveryman \"in recognition of his interest in London's architecture.\"[129] The Prince of Wales is also Permanent Master of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights, a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Drapers, an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians, an Honorary Member of the Court of Assistants of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, and a Royal Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Gardeners.[130]\nSince the early 1980s, Charles has promoted environmental awareness.[131] Upon moving into Highgrove House, he developed an interest in organic farming, which culminated in the 1990 launch of his own organic brand, Duchy Originals,[132] which now sells more than 200 different sustainably produced products, from food to garden furniture; the profits (over \u00a36\u00a0million by 2010) are donated to The Prince's Charities.[132][133] Documenting work on his estate, Charles co-authored (with Charles Clover, environment editor of The Daily Telegraph) Highgrove: An Experiment in Organic Gardening and Farming, published in 1993, and offers his patronage to Garden Organic. Along similar lines, the Prince of Wales became involved with farming and various industries within it, regularly meeting with farmers to discuss their trade. Although the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic in England prevented Charles from visiting organic farms in Saskatchewan, he met the farmers at Assiniboia town hall.[134][135] In 2004, he founded the Mutton Renaissance Campaign, which aims to support British sheep farmers and make mutton more attractive to Britons.[136] His organic farming has attracted media criticism: According to The Independent in October 2006, \"the story of Duchy Originals has involved compromises and ethical blips, wedded to a determined merchandising programme.\"[137]\nIn 2007, he received the 10th annual Global Environmental Citizen Award from the Harvard Medical School's Center for Health and the Global Environment, the director of which, Eric Chivian, stated: \"For decades the Prince of Wales has been a champion of the natural world\u00a0... He has been a world leader in efforts to improve energy efficiency and in reducing the discharge of toxic substances on land, and into the air and the oceans\".[138] Charles's travels by private jet drew criticism from Plane Stupid's Joss Garman.[139][140]\nIn 2007, Charles launched The Prince's May Day Network, which encourages businesses to take action on climate change. Speaking to the European Parliament on 14 February 2008, he called for European Union leadership in the war against climate change. During the standing ovation that followed, Nigel Farage, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), remained seated and went on to describe Charles's advisers as \"naive and foolish at best.\"[141] In a speech to the Low Carbon Prosperity Summit in a European Parliament chamber on 9 February 2011, Charles said that climate change sceptics are playing \"a reckless game of roulette\" with the planet's future and are having a \"corrosive effect\" on public opinion. He also articulated the need to protect fisheries and the Amazon rain forest, and to make low-carbon emissions affordable and competitive.[142]\nIn 2011, Charles received the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Medal for his engagement with the environment, such as the conservation of rainforests.[143]\nOn 27 August 2012, the Prince of Wales addressed the International Union for Conservation of Nature \u2013 World Conservation Congress, supporting the view that grazing animals are needed to keep soils and grassland productive:\nI have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called Allan Savory, in Zimbabwe and other semi arid areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive. Such that, if you take grazers off the land and lock them away in vast feedlots, the land dies.[144]In February 2014, Charles visited the Somerset levels to meet residents affected by winter flooding. During his visit, Charles remarked that \"There's nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something. The tragedy is that nothing happened for so long.\" He pledged a \u00a350,000 donation, provided by the Prince's Countryside Fund, to help families and businesses.[145][146][147]\nIn August 2019, it was announced that the Prince of Wales had collaborated with British fashion designers Vin and Omi to produce a line of clothing made out of nettles found in his Highgrove estate. Nettles are a type of plants which are usually \"perceived to have no value\". The Highgrove plant waste was also used to create the jewellery worn with the dresses.[148]\nCharles has controversially championed alternative medicine.[149] The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health attracted opposition from the scientific and medical community over its campaign encouraging general practitioners to offer herbal and other alternative treatments to National Health Service patients,[150][151] and in May 2006, Charles made a speech at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, urging the integration of conventional and alternative medicine and arguing for homeopathy.[152][8]\nIn April 2008, The Times published a letter from Edzard Ernst, Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, which asked the Prince's Foundation to recall two guides promoting alternative medicine, saying \"the majority of alternative therapies appear to be clinically ineffective, and many are downright dangerous.\" A speaker for the foundation countered the criticism by stating: \"We entirely reject the accusation that our online publication Complementary Healthcare: A Guide contains any misleading or inaccurate claims about the benefits of complementary therapies. On the contrary, it treats people as adults and takes a responsible approach by encouraging people to look at reliable sources of information\u00a0... so that they can make informed decisions. The foundation does not promote complementary therapies.\"[153] That year, Ernst published a book with Simon Singh, mockingly dedicated to \"HRH the Prince of Wales\" called Trick or Treatment: Alternative Medicine on Trial. The last chapter is highly critical of Charles's advocacy of complementary and alternative treatments.[154]\nThe Prince's Duchy Originals produce a variety of complementary medicinal products including a \"Detox Tincture\" that Edzard Ernst has denounced as \"financially exploiting the vulnerable\" and \"outright quackery\".[155] In 2009, the Advertising Standards Authority criticised an email that Duchy Originals had sent out to advertise its Echina-Relief, Hyperi-Lift and Detox Tinctures products saying that it was misleading.[155] The Prince personally wrote at least seven letters[156] to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) shortly before they relaxed the rules governing labelling of such herbal products, a move that has been widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies.[157] In October 2009, it was reported that Charles had personally lobbied the Health Secretary, Andy Burnham, regarding greater provision of alternative treatments in the NHS.[155] In 2016, Charles said in a speech that he used homeopathic veterinary medicines to reduce antibiotic use at his farm.[158]\nIn Ernst's book More Good Than Harm? The Moral Maze of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, he and ethicist Kevin Smith call Charles \"foolish and immoral\", and \"conclude that it is not possible to practice alternative medicine ethically\". Ernst further claims that the private secretary of the Prince contacted the vice chancellor of Exeter University to investigate Ernst's complaints against the \"Smallwood Report\", which the Prince had commissioned in 2005. While Ernst was \"found not to be guilty of any wrong-doing, all local support at Exeter stopped, which eventually led to my early retirement.\"[159]\nIn April 2010, following accounting irregularities, a former official at the foundation and his wife were arrested for fraud believed to total \u00a3300,000.[160] Four days later, the foundation announced its closure, claiming that it \"has achieved its key objective of promoting the use of integrated health.\"[161] The charity's finance director, accountant George Gray, was convicted of theft totalling \u00a3253,000 and sentenced to three years in prison.[162] The Prince's Foundation was re-branded and re-launched later in 2010 as The College of Medicine.[162][163][164]\nPrince Charles was confirmed at age 16 by Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey at Easter 1965, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[165] He attends services at various Anglican churches close to Highgrove,[166] and attends the Church of Scotland's Crathie Kirk with the rest of the royal family when staying at Balmoral Castle. In 2000, he was appointed as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Charles has visited (amid some secrecy) Orthodox monasteries several times on Mount Athos[167] as well as in Romania.[113] Charles is also patron of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies at the University of Oxford, and in the 2000s, he inaugurated the Markfield Institute of Higher Education, which is dedicated to Islamic studies in a plural multicultural context.[120][168][169]\nSir Laurens van der Post became a friend of Charles in 1977; he was dubbed his \"spiritual guru\" and was godfather to Charles's son, Prince William.[170] From van der Post, Prince Charles developed a focus on philosophy, especially that of Asian and Middle Eastern nations.[citation needed]\nCharles expressed his philosophical views in his 2010 book, Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,[171][172][173] which won a Nautilus Book Award.[174] Although it had been rumoured that Charles would vow to be \"Defender of the Faiths\" or \"Defender of Faith\" as king, he stated in 2015 that he would retain the monarch's traditional title of \"Defender of the Faith\", whilst \"ensuring that other people's faiths can also be practised\", which he sees as a duty of the Church of England.[175]\nIn January 2020 he visited Jerusalem for the Holocaust ceremonies, and after ceremonial meetings with the Presidents of Israel and of Palestine and other engagements, attended an ecumenical service in the Church of the Nativity and walked accompanied by Christian and Muslim spiritual leaders through the centre of Bethlehem.[citation needed]\nIn 2008, The Daily Telegraph declared Charles the \"hardest-working member of the royal family.\"[176] He carried out 560 official engagements in 2008,[176] 499 in 2010,[177] and over 600 in 2011.\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles undertakes official duties on behalf of the Queen and the Commonwealth realms. He officiates at investitures and attends the funerals of foreign dignitaries.[178] Prince Charles makes regular tours of Wales, fulfilling a week of engagements each summer, and attending important national occasions, such as opening the Senedd.[179] The six trustees of the Royal Collection Trust meet three times a year under his chairmanship.[180] Prince Charles travels abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Charles has been regarded as an effective advocate of the country. In 1983, Christopher John Lewis, who had fired a shot with a .22 rifle at the Queen in 1981, attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Charles, who was visiting New Zealand with Diana and William.[181] While visiting Australia in January 1994, two shots from a starting pistol were fired at him on Australia Day by David Kang in protest of the treatment of several hundred Cambodian asylum seekers held in detention camps.[182][183] In 1995, Charles became the first member of the royal family to visit the Republic of Ireland in an official capacity.[184][185]\nIn 2000, Charles revived the tradition of the Prince of Wales having an official harpist, in order to foster Welsh talent at playing the harp, the national instrument of Wales. He and the Duchess of Cornwall also spend one week each year in Scotland, where he is patron of several Scottish organisations.[186] His service to the Canadian Armed Forces permits him to be informed of troop activities, and allows him to visit these troops while in Canada or overseas, taking part in ceremonial occasions.[187] For instance, in 2001 he placed a specially commissioned wreath, made from vegetation taken from French battlefields, at the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,[188] and in 1981 he became the patron of the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum.[189] At the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Charles unintentionally caused controversy when he shook hands with Robert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe, who had been seated next to him. Charles's office subsequently released a statement saying: \"The Prince of Wales was caught by surprise and not in a position to avoid shaking Mr Mugabe's hand. The Prince finds the current Zimbabwean regime abhorrent. He has supported the Zimbabwe Defence and Aid Fund, which works with those being oppressed by the regime. The Prince also recently met Pius Ncube, the Archbishop of Bulawayo, an outspoken critic of the government.\"[190]\nIn 2010, Charles represented the Queen at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India.[191] He attends official events in the United Kingdom in support of Commonwealth countries, such as the Christchurch earthquake memorial service at Westminster Abbey in 2011.[192][193][194] From 15 to 17 November 2013, he represented the Queen for the first time at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, in Colombo, Sri Lanka.[195][196]\nLetters sent by Prince Charles to government ministers during 2004 and 2005\u2014the so-called black spider memos\u2014presented potential embarrassment following a challenge by The Guardian newspaper to release the letters under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In March 2015, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom decided that the Prince's letters must be released.[197] The letters were published by the Cabinet Office on 13 May 2015.[198][199][200] Reaction to the memos upon their release was largely supportive of Charles, with little criticism of him.[201] The memos were variously described in the press as \"underwhelming\"[202] and \"harmless\"[203] and that their release had \"backfired on those who seek to belittle him\",[204] with reaction from the public also supportive.[205]\nThe Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall made their first joint trip to the Republic of Ireland in May 2015. The trip was called an important step in \"promoting peace and reconciliation\" by the British Embassy.[206] During the trip, Charles shook hands with Sinn F\u00e9in and supposed IRA leader Gerry Adams in Galway, which was described by the media as a \"historic handshake\" and a \"significant moment for Anglo-Irish relations\".[207][208][209] In the run up to the Prince's visit, two Irish republican dissidents were arrested for planning a bomb attack. Semtex and rockets were found at the Dublin home of suspect Donal O'Coisdealbha, member of a self-styled \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann organisation, who was later jailed for five and a half years.[210] He was connected to a veteran republican, Seamus McGrane of County Louth, a member of the Real IRA, who was jailed for 11 and a half years.[211][212] In 2015, it was revealed that Prince Charles had access to confidential UK cabinet papers.[213]\nCharles has made frequent visits to Saudi Arabia in order to promote arms exports for companies such as BAE Systems. In 2013,[214] 2014,[215] and 2015,[216] he met with the commander of Saudi Arabia's National Guard Mutaib bin Abdullah. In February 2014, he took part in a traditional sword dance with members of the Saudi royal family at the Janariyah festival in Riyadh.[217] At the same festival, British arms company BAE Systems was honoured by Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz.[218] Charles was criticised by Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier in 2016 over his role in the sale of Typhoon fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.[219] According to Charles's biographer Catherine Mayer, a Time magazine journalist who claims to have interviewed several sources from Prince Charles's inner circle, he \"doesn't like being used to market weaponry\" in deals with Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf states. According to Mayer, Charles has only raised his objections to being used to sell weapons abroad in private.[220]\nCommonwealth heads of government decided at their 2018 meeting, that the Prince of Wales will be the next Head of the Commonwealth after the Queen. The head is chosen and therefore not hereditary.[221]\nOn 7 March 2019, the Queen hosted a Buckingham Palace event to mark the 50th anniversary of Charles's investiture as the Prince of Wales. Guests at the event included the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prime Minister Theresa May and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford.[222] The same month, at the request of the British government, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall went on an official tour to Cuba, making them the first British royalty to visit the country. The tour was seen as effort to form a closer relationship between the UK and Cuba.[223]\nFrom his youth until 1992, Prince Charles was an avid player of competitive polo. He continued to play informally, including for charity, until 2005.[224] Charles also frequently took part in fox hunting until the sport was banned in the United Kingdom in 2005. By the late 1990s, opposition to the activity was growing when Charles's participation was viewed as a \"political statement\" by those who were opposed to it. The League Against Cruel Sports launched an attack against Charles after he took his sons on the Beaufort Hunt in 1999. At that time, the government was trying to ban hunting with hounds.[225][226]\nCharles has been a keen salmon angler since youth and supports Orri Vigf\u00fasson's efforts to protect the North Atlantic salmon. He frequently fishes the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, while he claims his most special angling memories are from his time in Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, Iceland.[227] Charles is a supporter of Burnley Football Club.[228]\nPrince Charles is president or patron of more than 20 performing arts organisations, which include the Royal College of Music, the Royal Opera, the English Chamber Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, Welsh National Opera, and the Purcell School. \nIn 2000, he revived the tradition of appointing harpists to the Royal Court, by appointing an Official Harpist to the Prince of Wales. As an undergraduate at Cambridge he played cello, and has sung with the Bach Choir twice.[229]\nCharles founded The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts in 2002, to help more children experience the arts first-hand. He is president of the Royal Shakespeare Company and attends performances in Stratford-Upon-Avon, supports fundraising events and attends the company's annual general meeting.[229] He enjoys comedy,[230] and is interested in illusionism, becoming a member of The Magic Circle after passing his audition in 1975 by performing the \"cups and balls\" effect.[231]\nCharles is a keen and accomplished watercolourist who has exhibited and sold a number of his works and also published books on the subject. In 2001, 20 lithographs of his watercolour paintings illustrating his country estates were exhibited at the Florence International Biennale of Contemporary Art.[232] He is Honorary President of the Royal Academy of Arts Development Trust.[233]\nCharles was awarded the 2011 Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award by the Montblanc Cultural Foundation for his support and commitment to the arts, particularly in regard to young people.[234]\nOn 23 April 2016, Charles appeared in a comedy sketch for the Royal Shakespeare Company's Shakespeare Live! at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's death in 1616. The event was televised live by the BBC. Charles made a surprise entrance to settle the disputed delivery of Hamlet's celebrated line, \"To be or not to be, that is the question\".[235]\nPrince Charles is an author of several books that reflect his own interests. He has also contributed a foreword or preface to books by other writers and has also written, presented and has been featured in documentary films.[236][237][238][239]\nSince his birth, Prince Charles has undergone close media attention, which increased as he matured. It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and its aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king, such as the 2014 play King Charles III.[240]\nDescribed as the \"world's most eligible bachelor\" in the late 1970s,[241] Prince Charles was subsequently overshadowed by Diana. After her death, the media regularly breached Charles's privacy and printed expos\u00e9s.\nIn 2006, the prince filed a court case against the Mail on Sunday, after excerpts of his personal journals were published, revealing his opinions on matters such as the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997, in which Charles described the Chinese government officials as \"appalling old waxworks\".[242] Mark Bolland, his ex-private secretary, declared in a statement to the High Court that Charles \"would readily embrace the political aspects of any contentious issue he was interested in\u00a0... He carried it out in a very considered, thoughtful and researched way. He often referred to himself as a 'dissident' working against the prevailing political consensus.\"[242] Jonathan Dimbleby reported that the prince \"has accumulated a number of certainties about the state of the world and does not relish contradiction.\"[243]\nOther people who were formerly connected with the prince have betrayed his confidence. An ex-member of his household handed the press an internal memo in which Charles commented on ambition and opportunity, and which was widely interpreted as blaming meritocracy for creating a combative atmosphere in society. Charles responded: \"In my view, it is just as great an achievement to be a plumber or a bricklayer as it is to be a lawyer or a doctor\".[244]\nCharles's anguish was recorded in his private comments to Prince William, caught on a microphone during a press photo-call in 2005 and published in the national press. After a question from the BBC's royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, Charles muttered: \"These bloody people. I can't bear that man. I mean, he's so awful, he really is.\"[245]\nIn 2002, Charles, \"so often a target of the press, got his chance to return fire\" when addressing \"scores of editors, publishers and other media executives\" gathered at St Bride's Fleet Street to celebrate 300 years of journalism.[246][247] Defending public servants from \"the corrosive drip of constant criticism\", he noted that the press had been \"awkward, cantankerous, cynical, bloody-minded, at times intrusive, at times inaccurate and at times deeply unfair and harmful to individuals and to institutions.\"[247] But, he concluded, regarding his own relations with the press, \"from time to time we are probably both a bit hard on each other, exaggerating the downsides and ignoring the good points in each.\"[247]\nThe Prince of Wales has occasionally appeared on television. In 1984, he read his children's book The Old Man of Lochnagar for the BBC's Jackanory series. The UK soap opera Coronation Street featured an appearance by Charles during the show's 40th anniversary in 2000,[248] as did the New Zealand young adult cartoon series bro'Town (2005), after he attended a performance by the show's creators during a tour of the country.[249][250]\nCharles was interviewed with Princes William and Harry by Ant &amp; Dec to mark the 30th anniversary of The Prince's Trust in 2006[251] and in 2016 was interviewed by them again along with his sons and the Duchess of Cornwall to mark the 40th anniversary.[252]\nHis saving of the Scottish stately home Dumfries House was the subject of Alan Titchmarsh's documentary Royal Restoration, which aired on TV in May 2012.[253] Also in May 2012, Charles tried his hand at being a weather presenter for the BBC, reporting the forecast for Scotland as part of their annual week at Holyrood Palace alongside Christopher Blanchett. He injected humour in his report, asking, \"Who the hell wrote this script?\" as references were made to royal residences.[254]\nIn December 2015, Channel 4 News revealed that interviews with Charles were subject to a contract that restricts questions to those previously approved, and gives his staff oversight of editing and the right to \"remove the contribution in its entirety from the programme\". Channel 4 News decided not to proceed with an interview on this basis, which some journalists believed would put them at risk of breaching the Ofcom Broadcasting Code on editorial independence and transparency.[255]\nClarence House, previously the residence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, is Charles's official London residence.[256] His primary source of income is generated from the Duchy of Cornwall, which owns 133,658 acres of land (around 54,090 hectares), including farming, residential, and commercial properties, as well as an investment portfolio. Highgrove House in Gloucestershire is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, having been purchased for his use in 1980, and which Prince Charles rents for \u00a3336,000 per annum.[257] The Public Accounts Committee published its 25th report into the Duchy of Cornwall accounts in November 2013 noting that the duchy performed well in 2012\u201313, increasing its total income and producing an overall surplus of \u00a319.1 million.[258]\nIn 2007, the prince purchased a 192-acre property (150 acres of grazing and parkland, and 40 acres of woodland) in Carmarthenshire, and applied for permission to convert the farm into a Welsh home for him and the Duchess of Cornwall, to be rented out as holiday flats when the couple is not in residence.[259] A neighbouring family said the proposals flouted local planning regulations, and the application was put on hold temporarily while a report was drafted on how the alterations would affect the local bat population.[260] Charles and Camilla first stayed at the new property, called Llwynywermod, in June 2008.[261]\nIn 2016, it was reported that his estates receive \u00a3100,000 a year in European Union agricultural subsidies.[262] Starting in 1993, the Prince of Wales has paid tax voluntarily under the Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation, updated 2013.[263] In December 2012, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs were asked to investigate alleged tax avoidance by the Duchy of Cornwall.[264] The Duchy of Cornwall is named in the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment that were leaked to the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. The papers show that the Duchy invested in a Bermuda-based carbon credits trading company run by one of Charles's Cambridge contemporaries. The investment was kept secret but there is no suggestion that Charles or the estate avoided UK tax.[265]\nThe Prince's full title is: His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, KG, KT, GCB, OM, AK, QSO, CC, PC, ADC, Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.[266][267]\nCharles has held titles throughout his life: the grandson of the monarch, the son of the monarch and in his own right. He has been a British prince since birth and was created Prince of Wales in 1958.[fn 4] There has been speculation as to what regnal name the prince would choose upon his succession to the throne. If he uses his first name, he would be known as Charles III. However, it was reported in 2005 that Charles has suggested he may choose to reign as George VII in honour of his maternal grandfather, and to avoid association with the Stuart kings Charles I (who was beheaded) and Charles\u00a0II (who was known for his promiscuous lifestyle),[269] as well as to be sensitive to the memory of Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was called \"Charles III\" by his supporters.[269] Charles's office responded that \"no decision has been made\".[270]\nCharles has held substantive ranks in the armed forces of a number of countries since he was made a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force in 1972. Charles's first honorary appointment in the armed forces was as Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Regiment of Wales in 1969; since then, the prince has also been installed as Colonel-in-Chief, Colonel, Honorary Air Commodore, Air Commodore-in-Chief, Deputy Colonel-in-Chief, Royal Honorary Colonel, Royal Colonel, and Honorary Commodore of at least 32 military formations throughout the Commonwealth, including the Royal Gurkha Rifles, which is the only foreign regiment in the British army.[271] Since 2009, Charles holds the second-highest ranks in all three branches of the Canadian Forces and, on 16 June 2012, the Queen awarded the Prince of Wales honorary five-star rank in all three branches of the British Armed Forces, \"to acknowledge his support in her role as Commander-in-Chief\", installing him as Admiral of the Fleet, Field Marshal and Marshal of the Royal Air Force.[272][273][274]\nHe has been inducted into seven orders and received eight decorations from the Commonwealth realms, and has been the recipient of 20 different honours from foreign states, as well as nine honorary degrees from universities in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.\nThe banners used by the prince vary depending upon location. His Personal Standard is the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom differenced as in his arms with a label of three points Argent, and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre. It is used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when the prince is acting in an official capacity associated with the UK Armed Forces.[275]\nThe personal flag for use in Wales is based upon the Royal Badge of Wales (the historic arms of the Kingdom of Gwynedd), which consist of four quadrants, the first and fourth with a red lion on a gold field, and the second and third with a gold lion on a red field. Superimposed is an escutcheon Vert bearing the single-arched coronet of the Prince of Wales.[275]\nIn Scotland the personal banner used since 1974 is based upon three ancient Scottish titles: Duke of Rothesay (heir apparent to the King of Scots), High Steward of Scotland and Lord of the Isles. The flag is divided into four quadrants like the arms of the Chief of Clan Stewart of Appin; the first and fourth quadrants comprise a gold field with a blue and silver checkered band in the centre; the second and third quadrants display a black galley on a silver field. The arms are differenced from those of Appin by the addition of an inescutcheon bearing the tressured lion rampant of Scotland; defaced by a plain label of three points Azure to indicate the heir apparent.[275]\nIn Cornwall, the banner is the arms of the Duke of Cornwall: \"Sable 15 bezants Or\", that is, a black field bearing 15 gold coins.[275]\nIn 2011, the Canadian Heraldic Authority introduced a personal heraldic banner for the Prince of Wales for use in Canada, consisting of the shield of the Arms of Canada defaced with both a blue roundel of the Prince of Wales's feathers surrounded by a wreath of gold maple leaves, and a white label of three points.[276]\nBanner of arms\nStandard for Wales\nStandard for Scotland\nBanner of arms of the Duke of Cornwall\nStandard of the Prince of Wales for personal use in Canada\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nAvram Noam Chomsky[a] (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian,[b][c] social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\",[d] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Laureate Professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. Born to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner. An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\". Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of freedom of speech, including Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017. One of the most cited scholars alive,[20] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proven highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism. Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[21] His parents, Ze'ev \"William\" Chomsky and Elsie Simonofsky, were Jewish immigrants.[22] William had fled the Russian Empire in 1913 to escape conscription and worked in Baltimore sweatshops and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university.[23] After moving to Philadelphia, William became principal of the Congregation Mikveh Israel religious school and joined the Gratz College faculty. He placed great emphasis on educating people so that they would be \"well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all\", a mission that shaped and was subsequently adopted by his son.[24] Elsie was a teacher and activist born in Belarus. They met at Mikveh Israel, where they both worked.[22] Noam was the Chomskys' first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later, in 1934.[25][26] The brothers were close, though David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive.[27] Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of Zionism; the family was particularly influenced by the Left Zionist writings of Ahad Ha'am.[26] Chomsky faced antisemitism as a child, particularly from Philadelphia's Irish and German communities.[28] Chomsky attended the independent, Deweyite Oak Lane Country Day School[29] and Philadelphia's Central High School, where he excelled academically and joined various clubs and societies, but was troubled by the school's hierarchical and regimented teaching methods.[30] He also attended Hebrew High School at Gratz College, where his father taught.[31] Chomsky has described his parents as \"normal Roosevelt Democrats\" with center-left politics, but other relatives involved in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union exposed him to socialism and far-left politics.[32] He was substantially influenced by his uncle and the Jewish leftists who frequented his New York City newspaper stand to debate current affairs.[33] Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores when visiting his uncle in the city, voraciously reading political literature.[34] He wrote his first article at age 10 on the spread of fascism following the fall of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War[35] and, from the age of 12 or 13, identified with anarchist politics.[31] He later described his discovery of anarchism as \"a lucky accident\"[36] that made him critical of Stalinism and other forms of Marxism\u2013Leninism.[37] In 1945, aged 16, Chomsky began a general program of study at the University of Pennsylvania, where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning Arabic.[38] Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.[39] Frustrated with his experiences at the university, he considered dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine,[40] but his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.[41] Chomsky's BA honors thesis, \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\", applied Harris's methods to the language.[42] Chomsky revised this thesis for his MA, which he received from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951; it was subsequently published as a book.[43] He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of Nelson Goodman.[44] From 1951 to 1955 Chomsky was a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where he undertook research on what became his doctoral dissertation.[45] Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,[46] Chomsky was attracted to Harvard in part because the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, J. L. Austin of the University of Oxford, strongly influenced Chomsky.[47] In 1952 Chomsky published his first academic article, Systems of Syntactic Analysis, which appeared not in a journal of linguistics but in The Journal of Symbolic Logic.[46] Highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures at the University of Chicago and Yale University.[48] He had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, but in 1955 he submitted a thesis setting out his ideas on transformational grammar; he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree for it, and it was privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in 1975 as part of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory.[49] Harvard professor George Armitage Miller was impressed by Chomsky's thesis and collaborated with him on several technical papers in mathematical linguistics.[50] Chomsky's doctorate exempted him from compulsory military service, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.[51] In 1947 Chomsky began a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz, whom he had known since early childhood. They married in 1949.[52] After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to the Allston area of Boston and remained there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of Lexington.[53] In 1953 the couple took a Harvard travel grant to Europe, from the United Kingdom through France, Switzerland into Italy,[54] and Israel, where they lived in Hashomer Hatzair's HaZore'a kibbutz. Despite enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the country's Jewish nationalism, anti-Arab racism and, within the kibbutz's leftist community, pro-Stalinism.[55] On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of the Yiddish anarchist journal Fraye Arbeter Shtime and became enamored with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker, a contributor whose work introduced Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism.[56] Chomsky also read other political thinkers: the anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n, democratic socialists George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, and Dwight Macdonald, and works by Marxists Karl Liebknecht, Karl Korsch, and Rosa Luxemburg.[57] His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the Spanish Civil War, as documented in Orwell's Homage to Catalonia (1938).[58] He read the leftist journal Politics, which furthered his interest in anarchism,[59] and the council communist periodical Living Marxism, though he rejected the orthodoxy of its editor, Paul Mattick.[60] He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the Leninist League of the United States, an anti-Stalinist Marxist\u2013Leninist group, sharing their view that the Second World War was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's \"state capitalists\" to crush Europe's proletariat.[61] Chomsky befriended two linguists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson, the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position there in 1955. At MIT, Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project and half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy.[62] He described MIT as \"a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work.\"[63] In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor.[64] The Chomskys had their first child that same year, a daughter named Aviva.[65] He also published his first book on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris\u2013Bloomfield trend in the field.[66] Responses to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused \"significant upheaval\" in the discipline.[67] The linguist John Lyons later asserted that Syntactic Structures \"revolutionized the scientific study of language\".[68] From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[69] In 1959 Chomsky published a review of B. F. Skinner's 1957 book Verbal Behavior in the academic journal Language, in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior.[70][71] The review argued that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics and helped to establish Chomsky as an intellectual.[72] With Halle, Chomsky proceeded to found MIT's graduate program in linguistics. In 1961 he was awarded tenure, becoming a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.[73] Chomsky went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists, held in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which established him as the de facto spokesperson of American linguistics.[74] Between 1963 and 1965 he consulted on a military-sponsored project \"to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control\"; Barbara Partee, a collaborator on this project and then-student of Chomsky, has said this research was justified to the military on the basis that \"in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program.\"[75] Chomsky continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar (1966), and Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966).[76] Along with Halle, he also edited the Studies in Language series of books for Harper and Row.[77] As he began to accrue significant academic recognition and honors for his work, Chomsky lectured at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966.[78] His Beckman lectures at Berkeley were assembled and published as Language and Mind in 1968.[79] Despite his growing stature, an intellectual falling-out between Chomsky and some of his early colleagues and doctoral students\u2014including Paul Postal, John \"Haj\" Ross, George Lakoff, and James D. McCawley\u2014triggered a series of academic debates that came to be known as the \"Linguistics Wars\", although they revolved largely around philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.[80] Chomsky on the Vietnam War[81] Chomsky joined protests against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes.[82] His 1967 critique of U.S. involvement, \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\", among other contributions to The New York Review of Books, debuted Chomsky as a public dissident.[83] This essay and other political articles were collected and published in 1969 as part of Chomsky's first political book, American Power and the New Mandarins.[84] He followed this with further political books, including At War with Asia (1971), The Backroom Boys (1973), For Reasons of State (1973), and Peace in the Middle East? (1975), published by Pantheon Books.[85] These publications led to Chomsky's association with the American New Left movement,[86] though he thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm and preferred the company of activists to that of intellectuals.[87] Chomsky remained largely ignored by the mainstream press throughout this period.[88] He also became involved in left-wing activism. Chomsky refused to pay half his taxes, publicly supported students who refused the draft, and was arrested while participating an antiwar teach-in outside the Pentagon.[89] During this time, Chomsky co-founded the antiwar collective RESIST with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald.[90] Although he questioned the objectives of the 1968 student protests,[91] Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups and, with his colleague Louis Kampf, ran undergraduate courses on politics at MIT independently of the conservative-dominated political science department.[92] When student activists campaigned to stop weapons and counterinsurgency research at MIT, Chomsky was sympathetic but felt that the research should remain under MIT's oversight and limited to systems of deterrence and defense.[93] In 1970 he visited southeast Asia to lecture at Vietnam's Hanoi University of Science and Technology and toured war refugee camps in Laos. In 1973 he helped lead a committee commemorating the 50th anniversary of the War Resisters League.[94] Because of his antiwar activism, Chomsky was arrested on multiple occasions and included on President Richard Nixon's master list of political opponents.[95] Chomsky was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience and his wife began studying for her own doctorate in linguistics to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or joblessness.[96] Chomsky's scientific reputation insulated him from administrative action based on his beliefs.[97] His work in linguistics continued to gain international recognition as he received multiple honorary doctorates.[98] He delivered public lectures at the University of Cambridge, Columbia University (Woodbridge Lectures), and Stanford University.[99] His appearance in a 1971 debate with French continental philosopher Michel Foucault positioned Chomsky as a symbolic figurehead of analytic philosophy.[100] He continued to publish extensively on linguistics, producing Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar (1972),[97] an enlarged edition of Language and Mind (1972),[101] and Reflections on Language (1975).[101] In 1974 Chomsky became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.[99] In the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's linguistic publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory.[102] His political talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized the Israeli government and military.[103] In the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with Edward S. Herman, who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam.[104] Together they wrote Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact & Propaganda, a book that criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and the mainstream media's failure to cover it. Warner Modular published it in 1973, but its parent company disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies destroyed.[105] While mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from Michael Albert's South End Press, an activist-oriented publishing company.[106] In 1979, South End published Chomsky and Herman's revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence as the two-volume The Political Economy of Human Rights,[107] which compares U.S. media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. It argues that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on events in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy.[108] Chomsky's response included two testimonials before the United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization, successful encouragement for American media to cover the occupation, and meetings with refugees in Lisbon.[109] The Marxist academic Steven Lukes publicly accused Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot.[110] The controversy damaged Chomsky's reputation,[111] and he maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies to defame him.[112] Chomsky had long publicly criticized Nazism, and totalitarianism more generally, but his commitment to freedom of speech led him to defend the right of French historian Robert Faurisson to advocate a position widely characterized as Holocaust denial. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for Faurisson's freedom of speech was published as the preface to the latter's 1980 book M\u00e9moire en d\u00e9fense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire.[113] Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson,[114] and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations.[115] Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist Werner Cohn later published an analysis of the affair titled Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers.[116] The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career,[117] especially in France.[118] In 1985, during the Nicaraguan Contra War\u2014in which the U.S. supported the contra militia against the Sandinista government\u2014Chomsky traveled to Managua to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics.[119] Many of these lectures were published in 1987 as On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures.[120] In 1983 he published The Fateful Triangle, which argued that the U.S. had continually used the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict for its own ends.[121] In 1988, Chomsky visited the Palestinian territories to witness the impact of Israeli occupation.[122] In 1988, Chomsky and Herman published Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, in which they outlined their propaganda model for understanding mainstream media. They argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news is censored through five filters that have great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented.[123] The book was inspired by Alex Carey and adapted into a 1992 film.[124] In 1989, Chomsky published Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies, in which he suggests that democratic citizens, to make a worthwhile democracy, undertake intellectual self-defense against the media and elite intellectual culture that seeks to control them.[125] By the 1980s, Chomsky's students had become prominent linguists who, in turn, expanded and revised his linguistic theories.[126] In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before.[127] Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance.[128] The lectures he gave on the subject were published as Powers and Prospects in 1996.[128] As a result of the international publicity Chomsky generated, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger.[129] After East Timor attained independence from Indonesia in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty.[130] After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed; Seven Stories Press collated and published these interviews that October.[131] Chomsky argued that the ensuing War on Terror was not a new development but a continuation of U.S. foreign policy and concomitant rhetoric since at least the Reagan era.[132] He gave the D.T. Lakdawala Memorial Lecture in New Delhi in 2001,[133] and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the Latin American Association of Social Scientists.[134] Chomsky's 2003 Hegemony or Survival articulated what he called the United States' \"imperial grand strategy\" and critiqued the Iraq War and other aspects of the War on Terror.[135] Chomsky toured internationally with greater regularity during this period.[134] Chomsky retired from MIT in 2002,[136] but continued to conduct research and seminars on campus as an emeritus.[137] That same year he visited Turkey to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a co-defendant and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the charge on the first day.[138] During that trip Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favor of the Kurds' human rights.[138] A supporter of the World Social Forum, he attended its conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.[139] Chomsky supported the Occupy movement, delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence: Occupy (2012), a pamphlet, and Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity (2013). He attributed Occupy's growth to a perception that the Democratic Party had abandoned the interests of the white working class.[140] In March 2014, Chomsky joined the advisory council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation,[141] an organization that advocates the global abolition of nuclear weapons, as a senior fellow.[142] The 2016 documentary Requiem for the American Dream summarizes his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a \"75-minute teach-in\".[143] In 2017, Chomsky taught a short-term politics course at the University of Arizona in Tucson[144] and was later hired as a part-time professor in the linguistics department there, with his duties including teaching and public seminars.[145] His salary is covered by philanthropic donations.[146] Chomsky signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins in 2018.[147][148] Edward Marcotte on the significance of Chomsky's linguistic theory[149] The basis of Chomsky's linguistic theory lies in biolinguistics, the linguistic school that holds that the principles underpinning the structure of language are biologically preset in the human mind and hence genetically inherited.[150] As such he argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences.[151] In adopting this position Chomsky rejects the radical behaviorist psychology of B.\u00a0F. Skinner, who viewed behavior (including talking and thinking) as a completely learned product of the interactions between organisms and their environments. Accordingly, Chomsky argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and distinguished from modes of communication used by any other animal species.[152][153] Chomsky's nativist, internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of \"rationalism\" and contrasts with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language consistent with the philosophical school of \"empiricism\",[154] which contends that all knowledge, including language, comes from external stimuli.[149] Since the 1960s Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain language-specific features of their native languages. He bases his argument on observations about human language acquisition and describes a \"poverty of the stimulus\": an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic competence they attain. For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language.[155] To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the language acquisition device, and suggested that one of linguists' tasks should be to determine what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that result from these constraints would constitute \"universal grammar\".[156][157][158] Multiple scholars have challenged universal grammar on the grounds of the evolutionary infeasibility of its genetic basis for language,[159] the lack of universal characteristics between languages,[160] and the unproven link between innate/universal structures and the structures of specific languages.[161] Transformational-generative grammar is a broad theory used to model, encode, and deduce a native speaker's linguistic capabilities.[162] These models, or \"formal grammars\", show the abstract structures of a specific language as they may relate to structures in other languages.[163] Chomsky developed transformational grammar in the mid-1950s, whereupon it became the dominant syntactic theory in linguistics for two decades.[162] \"Transformations\" refers to syntactic relationships within language, e.g., being able to infer that the subject between two sentences is the same person.[164] Chomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures: Outward-facing surface structures relate phonetic rules into sound, while inward-facing deep structures relate words and conceptual meaning. Transformational-generative grammar uses mathematical notation to express the rules that govern the connection between meaning and sound (deep and surface structures, respectively). By this theory, linguistic principles can mathematically generate potential sentences structures in a language.[149] Scholar Michael Tomasello has challenged Chomsky's theory as based in logic and not empiricism.[165] Based on this rule-based notation of grammars, Chomsky grouped natural languages into a series of four nested subsets and increasingly complex types, together known as the Chomsky hierarchy. This classification was and remains foundational to formal language theory,[166] and relevant to theoretical computer science, especially programming language theory,[167] compiler construction, and automata theory.[168] Following transformational grammar's heyday through the mid-1970s, a derivative[162] government and binding theory became a dominant research framework through the early 1990s (and remains an influential theory[162]) when linguists turned to a \"minimalist\" approach to grammar. This research focused on the principles and parameters framework, which explained children's ability to learn any language by filling open parameters (a set of universal grammar principles) that adapt as the child encounters linguistic data.[169] The minimalist program, initiated by Chomsky,[170] asks which minimal principles and parameters theory fits most elegantly, naturally, and simply.[169] In an attempt to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties, Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as \"deep structure\" and \"surface structure\" and instead emphasizes the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, with which come an infinite number of concepts, or \"logical forms\".[153] When exposed to linguistic data, a hearer-speaker's brain proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way language works. Thus while much of Chomsky's prior research focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms the brain uses to generate these rules and regulate speech.[153][171] James McGilvray, 2014[172] Chomsky is a prominent political dissident.[e] His political views have changed little since his childhood,[173] when he was influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working-class tradition.[174] He usually identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist.[175] He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet human needs: liberty, community, and freedom of association.[176] Unlike some other socialists, such as Marxists, Chomsky believes that politics lies outside the remit of science,[177] but he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories.[178] In Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed by an elite corporatocracy, which uses corporate media, advertising, and think tanks to promote its own propaganda. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth they obscure.[179] Chomsky believes this web of falsehood can be broken by \"common sense\", critical thinking, and understanding the roles of self-interest and self-deception,[180] and that intellectuals abdicate their moral responsibility to tell the truth about the world in fear of losing prestige and funding.[181] He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his social privilege, resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.[182] Although he has joined protest marches and organized activist groups, Chomsky's primary political outlets are education and publication. He offers a wide range of political writings[183] as well as free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness.[184] He is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World international union.[185] Chomsky has been a prominent critic of American imperialism;[186] he believes that the basic principle of the foreign policy of the United States is the establishment of \"open societies\" that are economically and politically controlled by the United States and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.[187] He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.[181] When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.[188] He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading Christianity; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.[189] Prominent examples he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.[189] Chomsky's political work has centered heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States.[188] He has said he focuses on the U.S. because the country has militarily and economically dominated the world during his lifetime and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows the citizenry to influence government policy.[190] His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the impact U.S. foreign policies have on the populations affected by them, he can sway the populations of the U.S. and other countries into opposing the policies.[189] He urges people to criticize their governments' motivations, decisions, and actions, to accept responsibility for their own thoughts and actions, and to apply the same standards to others as to themselves.[191] Chomsky has been critical of U.S. involvement in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.[181] Chomsky also criticizes the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, highlighting that Saudi Arabia has \"one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world\".[192] In his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of capitalism and the pursuit of material wealth.[193] At the same time, he developed a disdain for authoritarian socialism, as represented by the Marxist\u2013Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.[194] Rather than accepting the common view among U.S. economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy and total private ownership, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy and total autocratic control (whether state or private).[195] He argues that Western capitalist countries are not really democratic,[196] because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.[197] He has stated his opposition to ruling elites, among them institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and GATT.[198] Chomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the Bretton Woods financial control agreement.[199] He characterizes the U.S. as a de facto one-party state, viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic Party as manifestations of a single \"Business Party\" controlled by corporate and financial interests.[200] Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.[201] Noting the entrenchment of such an economic system, Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably.[201] Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions.[199] He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.[201] Chomsky sees libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas as the descendants of the classical liberal ideas of the Age of Enlightenment,[202] arguing that his ideological position revolves around \"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being\".[203] He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of the means of production and government by workers' councils, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.[204] The point of this self-governance is to make each citizen, in Thomas Jefferson's words, \"a direct participator in the government of affairs.\"[205] He believes that there will be no need for political parties.[206] By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose.[207] He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.[208] Chomsky criticizing Israel, 2012[209] Chomsky has written prolifically on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aiming to raise public awareness of it.[210] He has long endorsed a left binationalist program in Israel and Palestine, seeking to create a democratic state in the Levant that is home to both Jews and Arabs.[211] Nevertheless, given the realpolitik of the situation, he has also considered a two-state solution on the condition that the nation-states exist on equal terms.[212] Chomsky was denied entry to the West Bank in 2010 because of his criticisms of Israel. He had been invited to deliver a lecture at Bir Zeit University and was to meet with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.[213][214][215][216] An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman later said that Chomsky was denied entry by mistake.[217] Chomsky's political writings have largely focused on ideology, social and political power, the media, and state policy.[218] One of his best-known works, Manufacturing Consent, dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, by government-guided \"free market\" forces, is subtler and harder to undermine than was the equivalent propaganda system in the Soviet Union.[219] As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate-owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.[220] Acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the mass media's choices of topics and issues, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology:[221] although mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.[222] As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.[223] He also points to examples of important news stories that the U.S. mainstream media has ignored because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the country, including the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres in Nicaragua perpetrated by U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths without equivalent coverage of the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in that conflict.[224] To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.[225] Chomsky considers most conspiracy theories fruitless, distracting substitutes for thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.[226] While not dismissing them outright, he considers them unproductive to challenging power in a substantial way. In response to the labeling of his own ideas as a conspiracy theory, Chomsky has said that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether General Motors would be accused of conspiracy if it deliberately selected what it used or discarded to sell its product.[227] Chomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields, including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.[228] In these fields he is credited with ushering in the \"cognitive revolution\",[228] a significant paradigm shift that rejected logical positivism, the prevailing philosophical methodology of the time, and reframed how philosophers think about language and the mind.[170] Chomsky views the cognitive revolution as rooted in 17th-century rationalist ideals.[229] His position\u2014the idea that the mind contains inherent structures to understand language, perception, and thought\u2014has more in common with rationalism (Enlightenment and Cartesian) than behaviorism.[230] He named one of his key works Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966).[229] In philosophy of language, Chomsky is particularly known for his criticisms of the notion of reference and meaning in human language and his perspective on the nature and function of mental representations.[231] Chomsky's famous 1971 debate on human nature with the French philosopher Michel Foucault was symbolic in positioning Chomsky as the prototypical analytic philosopher against Foucault, a stalwart of the continental tradition.[100] It showed what appeared to be irreconcilable differences between two moral and intellectual luminaries of the 20th century. Foucault's position was that of critique, that human nature could not be conceived in terms foreign to present understanding, while Chomsky held that human nature contained universalities such as a common standard of moral justice as deduced through reason based on what rationally serves human necessity.[232] Chomsky criticized postmodernism and French philosophy generally, arguing that the obscure language of postmodern, leftist philosophers gives little aid to the working classes.[233] He has also debated analytic philosophers, including Tyler Burge, Donald Davidson, Michael Dummett, Saul Kripke, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Willard Van Orman Quine, and John Searle.[170] Chomsky's contributions span intellectual and world history, including history of philosophy.[234] Irony is a recurring characteristic of his writing, as he often implies that his readers know better, which can make them more engaged in the veracity of his claims.[235] Chomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another,[236] calling himself \"scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom\".[237] An intensely private person,[238] he is uninterested in appearances and the fame his work has brought him.[239] He also has little interest in modern art and music.[240] McGilvray suggests that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so.[241] Chomsky acknowledges that his income affords him a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population;[242] nevertheless, he characterizes himself as a \"worker\", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.[243] He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the US, he subscribes to The Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Christian Science Monitor.[244] Chomsky is non-religious, but has expressed approval of forms of religion such as liberation theology.[245] Chomsky has attracted controversy for calling established political and academic figures \"corrupt\", \"fascist\", and \"fraudulent\".[246] His colleague Steven Pinker has said that he \"portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric\", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions he receives from critics.[247] Chomsky avoids attending academic conferences, including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.[248] His approach to academic freedom has led him to support MIT academics whose actions he deplores; in 1969, when Chomsky heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was denied a position at MIT. In 1989, when Pentagon adviser John Deutch applied to be president of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, \"He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met. ... If somebody's got to be running the CIA, I'm glad it's him.\"[249] Chomsky was married to Carol (n\u00e9e\u00a0Carol Doris Schatz) from 1949 until her death in 2008.[243] They had three children together: Aviva (b. 1957), Diane (b. 1960), and Harry (b. 1967).[250] In 2014, Chomsky married Valeria Wasserman.[251] Sperlich, 2006[252] Chomsky has been a defining Western intellectual figure, central to the field of linguistics and definitive in cognitive science, computer science, philosophy, and psychology.[253] In addition to being known as one of the most important intellectuals of his time,[f] Chomsky carries a dual legacy as both a \"leader in the field\" of linguistics and \"a figure of enlightenment and inspiration\" for political dissenters.[254] Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in his being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being \"on the outer margin of acceptability\".[255] The reception of his work is intertwined with his public image as an anarchist, a gadfly, an historian, a Jew, a linguist, and a philosopher.[9] McGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the \"cognitive revolution\" in linguistics,[256] and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal, natural science,[257] moving it away from the procedural form of structural linguistics dominant during the mid-20th century.[258] As such, some have called Chomsky \"the father of modern linguistics\".[d] Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become \"the most dynamic and influential\" school of thought in the field.[259] By the 1970s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,[260] and a Minnesota State University Moorhead poll ranked Syntactic Structures as the single most important work in cognitive science.[261] In addition, his work in automata theory and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in computer science, and he is much cited in computational linguistics.[262][263][264] Chomsky's criticisms of behaviorism contributed substantially to the decline of behaviorist psychology;[265] in addition, he is generally regarded as one of the primary founders of the field of cognitive science.[266][228] Some arguments in evolutionary psychology are derived from his research results;[267] Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in animal language acquisition at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.[268] ACM Turing Award winner Donald Knuth credited Chomsky's work with helping him combine his interests in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science.[269] IBM computer scientist John Backus, another Turing Award winner, used some of Chomsky's concepts to help him develop FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level computer programming language.[270] The laureates of the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \u2014 Georges J. F. K\u00f6hler, C\u00e9sar Milstein, and Niels Kaj Jerne \u2014 used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system,[271] equating \"components of a generative grammar ... with various features of protein structures.\"[272] Chomsky's theory of generative grammar has also influenced work in music theory and analysis.[273][274][275] An MIT press release stated that Chomsky was cited within the Arts and Humanities Citation Index more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992.[276] Chomsky was also extensively cited in the Social Sciences Citation Index and Science Citation Index during the same time period, with the librarian who conducted the research commenting that the statistics show that \"he is very widely read across disciplines and that his work is used by researchers across disciplines ... it seems that you can't write a paper without citing Noam Chomsky.\"[253] As a result of his influence, there are dueling camps of Chomskyan and non-Chomskyan linguistics, with the disputes between the two camps often acrimonious.[277] Chomsky's status as the \"most-quoted living author\" is credited to his political writings, which vastly outnumber his writings on linguistics.[278] Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes him as \"one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people\";[238] journalist John Pilger has described him as a \"genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins\u2014activists and movements\u2014he's unfailingly supportive.\"[247] Arundhati Roy has called him \"one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time\",[279] and Edward Said thought him \"one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions\".[247] Fred Halliday has said that by the start of the 21st century Chomsky had become a \"guru\" for the world's anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.[247] The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media,[280] also exerting a significant influence on the growth of alternative media, including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.[281] Sperlich also notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.[137] University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their undergraduate syllabi.[282] Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas; he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so.[182] According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics \"do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text\".[182] Chomsky drew criticism for not calling the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnian War a \"genocide\", which he said would devalue the word,[283] and in appearing to deny Ed Vulliamy's reporting on the existence of Bosnian concentration camps. The subsequent editorial correction of his comments, viewed as a capitulation, was criticized by multiple Balkan watchers.[284] Chomsky's far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored his activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point, possibly in violation of federal law.[285] He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, but has refused uniformed police protection.[286] German newspaper Der Spiegel described Chomsky as \"the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred\",[137] while conservative commentator David Horowitz called him \"the most devious, the most dishonest and\u00a0... the most treacherous intellect in America\", whose work is infused with \"anti-American dementia\" and evidences his \"pathological hatred of his own country\".[287] Writing in Commentary magazine, the journalist Jonathan Kay described Chomsky as \"a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says\".[288] Chomsky's criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an anti-Semite.[289] Criticizing Chomsky's defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, Werner Cohn called Chomsky \"the most important patron\" of the neo-Nazi movement.[290] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which has been accused of monitoring Chomsky's activities,[291] called him a Holocaust denier,[292] describing him as a \"dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims\".[292] In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by \"Stalinist types\" who oppose democracy in Israel.[289] The lawyer Alan Dershowitz has called Chomsky a \"false prophet of the left\";[293] Chomsky called Dershowitz \"a complete liar\" who is on \"a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation\".[294] In early 2016 President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an open letter condemning Erdo\u011fan for his anti-Kurdish repression and double standards on terrorism.[295] Chomsky accused Erdo\u011fan of hypocrisy, noting that Erdo\u011fan supports al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate,[296] the al-Nusra Front.[295] In 1970, the London Times named Chomsky one of the \"makers of the twentieth century\".[149] He was voted the world's leading public intellectual in The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll jointly conducted by American magazine Foreign Policy and British magazine Prospect.[297] New Statesman readers listed Chomsky among the world's foremost heroes in 2006.[298] In the United States he is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Linguistic Society of America, the American Philosophical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[299] Abroad he is a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, an honorary member of the British Psychological Society, a member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina,[299] and a foreign member of the Department of Social Sciences of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.[300] He received a 1971 Guggenheim Fellowship, the 1984 American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology, the 1988 Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences, the 1996 Helmholtz Medal,[299] the 1999 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science,[301] the 2010 Erich Fromm Prize,[302] and the British Academy's 2014 Neil and Saras Smith Medal for Linguistics.[303] He is also a two-time winner of the NCTE George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language (1987 and 1989).[299] He has also received the Rabindranath Tagore Centenary Award from The Asiatic Society.[304] Chomsky received the 2004 Carl-von-Ossietzky Prize from the city of Oldenburg, Germany, to acknowledge his body of work as a political analyst and media critic.[305] He received an honorary fellowship in 2005 from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin.[306] He received the 2008 President's Medal from the Literary and Debating Society of the National University of Ireland, Galway.[307] Since 2009, he has been an honorary member of International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters (IAPTI).[308] He received the University of Wisconsin's A.E. Havens Center's Award for Lifetime Contribution to Critical Scholarship[309] and was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems' AI's Hall of Fame for \"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems.\"[310] Chomsky has an Erd\u0151s number of four.[311] In 2011, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded Chomsky the US Peace Prize for antiwar activities over five decades.[312] For his work in human rights, peace, and social criticism, he received the 2011 Sydney Peace Prize,[313] the 2017 Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize[314] and the Dorothy Eldridge Peacemaker Award.[301] Chomsky has received honorary doctorates from institutions including the University of London and the University of Chicago (1967), Loyola University Chicago and Swarthmore College (1970), Bard College (1971), Delhi University (1972), and the University of Massachusetts (1973) among others.[98] His public lectures have included the 1969 John Locke Lectures,[301] 1975 Whidden Lectures,[99] 1977 Huizinga Lecture, and 1988 Massey Lectures, among others.[301] Various tributes to Chomsky have been dedicated over the years. He is the eponym for a bee species,[315] a frog species,[316] and a building complex at the Indian university Jamia Millia Islamia.[317] Actor Viggo Mortensen and avant-garde guitarist Buckethead dedicated their 2003 album Pandemoniumfromamerica to Chomsky.[318] Linguistics Politics",

Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\",[d] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Laureate Professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.\nBorn to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.\nAn outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\". Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of freedom of speech, including Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.\nOne of the most cited scholars alive,[20] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proven highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism.\nAvram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[21] His parents, Ze'ev \"William\" Chomsky and Elsie Simonofsky, were Jewish immigrants.[22] William had fled the Russian Empire in 1913 to escape conscription and worked in Baltimore sweatshops and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university.[23] After moving to Philadelphia, William became principal of the Congregation Mikveh Israel religious school and joined the Gratz College faculty. He placed great emphasis on educating people so that they would be \"well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all\", a mission that shaped and was subsequently adopted by his son.[24] Elsie was a teacher and activist born in Belarus. They met at Mikveh Israel, where they both worked.[22]\nNoam was the Chomskys' first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later, in 1934.[25][26] The brothers were close, though David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive.[27] Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of Zionism; the family was particularly influenced by the Left Zionist writings of Ahad Ha'am.[26] Chomsky faced antisemitism as a child, particularly from Philadelphia's Irish and German communities.[28]\nChomsky attended the independent, Deweyite Oak Lane Country Day School[29] and Philadelphia's Central High School, where he excelled academically and joined various clubs and societies, but was troubled by the school's hierarchical and regimented teaching methods.[30] He also attended Hebrew High School at Gratz College, where his father taught.[31]\nChomsky has described his parents as \"normal Roosevelt Democrats\" with center-left politics, but other relatives involved in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union exposed him to socialism and far-left politics.[32] He was substantially influenced by his uncle and the Jewish leftists who frequented his New York City newspaper stand to debate current affairs.[33] Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores when visiting his uncle in the city, voraciously reading political literature.[34] He wrote his first article at age 10 on the spread of fascism following the fall of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War[35] and, from the age of 12 or 13, identified with anarchist politics.[31] He later described his discovery of anarchism as \"a lucky accident\"[36] that made him critical of Stalinism and other forms of Marxism\u2013Leninism.[37]\nIn 1945, aged 16, Chomsky began a general program of study at the University of Pennsylvania, where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning Arabic.[38] Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.[39] Frustrated with his experiences at the university, he considered dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine,[40] but his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.[41] Chomsky's BA honors thesis, \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\", applied Harris's methods to the language.[42] Chomsky revised this thesis for his MA, which he received from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951; it was subsequently published as a book.[43] He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of Nelson Goodman.[44]\nFrom 1951 to 1955 Chomsky was a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where he undertook research on what became his doctoral dissertation.[45] Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,[46] Chomsky was attracted to Harvard in part because the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, J. L. Austin of the University of Oxford, strongly influenced Chomsky.[47] In 1952 Chomsky published his first academic article, Systems of Syntactic Analysis, which appeared not in a journal of linguistics but in The Journal of Symbolic Logic.[46] Highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures at the University of Chicago and Yale University.[48] He had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, but in 1955 he submitted a thesis setting out his ideas on transformational grammar; he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree for it, and it was privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in 1975 as part of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory.[49] Harvard professor George Armitage Miller was impressed by Chomsky's thesis and collaborated with him on several technical papers in mathematical linguistics.[50] Chomsky's doctorate exempted him from compulsory military service, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.[51]\nIn 1947 Chomsky began a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz, whom he had known since early childhood. They married in 1949.[52] After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to the Allston area of Boston and remained there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of Lexington.[53] In 1953 the couple took a Harvard travel grant to Europe, from the United Kingdom through France, Switzerland into Italy,[54] and Israel, where they lived in Hashomer Hatzair's HaZore'a kibbutz. Despite enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the country's Jewish nationalism, anti-Arab racism and, within the kibbutz's leftist community, pro-Stalinism.[55]\nOn visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of the Yiddish anarchist journal Fraye Arbeter Shtime and became enamored with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker, a contributor whose work introduced Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism.[56] Chomsky also read other political thinkers: the anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n, democratic socialists George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, and Dwight Macdonald, and works by Marxists Karl Liebknecht, Karl Korsch, and Rosa Luxemburg.[57] His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the Spanish Civil War, as documented in Orwell's Homage to Catalonia (1938).[58] He read the leftist journal Politics, which furthered his interest in anarchism,[59] and the council communist periodical Living Marxism, though he rejected the orthodoxy of its editor, Paul Mattick.[60] He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the Leninist League of the United States, an anti-Stalinist Marxist\u2013Leninist group, sharing their view that the Second World War was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's \"state capitalists\" to crush Europe's proletariat.[61]\nChomsky befriended two linguists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson, the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position there in 1955. At MIT, Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project and half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy.[62] He described MIT as \"a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work.\"[63] In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor.[64] The Chomskys had their first child that same year, a daughter named Aviva.[65] He also published his first book on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris\u2013Bloomfield trend in the field.[66] Responses to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused \"significant upheaval\" in the discipline.[67] The linguist John Lyons later asserted that Syntactic Structures \"revolutionized the scientific study of language\".[68] From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[69]\nIn 1959 Chomsky published a review of B. F. Skinner's 1957 book Verbal Behavior in the academic journal Language, in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior.[70][71] The review argued that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics and helped to establish Chomsky as an intellectual.[72] With Halle, Chomsky proceeded to found MIT's graduate program in linguistics. In 1961 he was awarded tenure, becoming a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.[73] Chomsky went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists, held in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which established him as the de facto spokesperson of American linguistics.[74] Between 1963 and 1965 he consulted on a military-sponsored project \"to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control\"; Barbara Partee, a collaborator on this project and then-student of Chomsky, has said this research was justified to the military on the basis that \"in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program.\"[75]\nChomsky continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar (1966), and Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966).[76] Along with Halle, he also edited the Studies in Language series of books for Harper and Row.[77] As he began to accrue significant academic recognition and honors for his work, Chomsky lectured at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966.[78] His Beckman lectures at Berkeley were assembled and published as Language and Mind in 1968.[79] Despite his growing stature, an intellectual falling-out between Chomsky and some of his early colleagues and doctoral students\u2014including Paul Postal, John \"Haj\" Ross, George Lakoff, and James D. McCawley\u2014triggered a series of academic debates that came to be known as the \"Linguistics Wars\", although they revolved largely around philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.[80]\nChomsky on the Vietnam War[81]\nChomsky joined protests against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes.[82] His 1967 critique of U.S. involvement, \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\", among other contributions to The New York Review of Books, debuted Chomsky as a public dissident.[83] This essay and other political articles were collected and published in 1969 as part of Chomsky's first political book, American Power and the New Mandarins.[84] He followed this with further political books, including At War with Asia (1971), The Backroom Boys (1973), For Reasons of State (1973), and Peace in the Middle East? (1975), published by Pantheon Books.[85] These publications led to Chomsky's association with the American New Left movement,[86] though he thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm and preferred the company of activists to that of intellectuals.[87] Chomsky remained largely ignored by the mainstream press throughout this period.[88]\nHe also became involved in left-wing activism. Chomsky refused to pay half his taxes, publicly supported students who refused the draft, and was arrested while participating an antiwar teach-in outside the Pentagon.[89] During this time, Chomsky co-founded the antiwar collective RESIST with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald.[90] Although he questioned the objectives of the 1968 student protests,[91] Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups and, with his colleague Louis Kampf, ran undergraduate courses on politics at MIT independently of the conservative-dominated political science department.[92] When student activists campaigned to stop weapons and counterinsurgency research at MIT, Chomsky was sympathetic but felt that the research should remain under MIT's oversight and limited to systems of deterrence and defense.[93] In 1970 he visited southeast Asia to lecture at Vietnam's Hanoi University of Science and Technology and toured war refugee camps in Laos. In 1973 he helped lead a committee commemorating the 50th anniversary of the War Resisters League.[94]\nBecause of his antiwar activism, Chomsky was arrested on multiple occasions and included on President Richard Nixon's master list of political opponents.[95] Chomsky was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience and his wife began studying for her own doctorate in linguistics to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or joblessness.[96] Chomsky's scientific reputation insulated him from administrative action based on his beliefs.[97]\nHis work in linguistics continued to gain international recognition as he received multiple honorary doctorates.[98] He delivered public lectures at the University of Cambridge, Columbia University (Woodbridge Lectures), and Stanford University.[99] His appearance in a 1971 debate with French continental philosopher Michel Foucault positioned Chomsky as a symbolic figurehead of analytic philosophy.[100] He continued to publish extensively on linguistics, producing Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar (1972),[97] an enlarged edition of Language and Mind (1972),[101] and Reflections on Language (1975).[101] In 1974 Chomsky became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.[99]\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's linguistic publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory.[102] His political talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized the Israeli government and military.[103] In the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with Edward S. Herman, who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam.[104] Together they wrote Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact &amp; Propaganda, a book that criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and the mainstream media's failure to cover it. Warner Modular published it in 1973, but its parent company disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies destroyed.[105]\nWhile mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from Michael Albert's South End Press, an activist-oriented publishing company.[106] In 1979, South End published Chomsky and Herman's revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence as the two-volume The Political Economy of Human Rights,[107] which compares U.S. media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. It argues that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on events in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy.[108] Chomsky's response included two testimonials before the United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization, successful encouragement for American media to cover the occupation, and meetings with refugees in Lisbon.[109] The Marxist academic Steven Lukes publicly accused Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot.[110] The controversy damaged Chomsky's reputation,[111] and he maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies to defame him.[112]\nChomsky had long publicly criticized Nazism, and totalitarianism more generally, but his commitment to freedom of speech led him to defend the right of French historian Robert Faurisson to advocate a position widely characterized as Holocaust denial. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for Faurisson's freedom of speech was published as the preface to the latter's 1980 book M\u00e9moire en d\u00e9fense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire.[113] Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson,[114] and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations.[115] Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist Werner Cohn later published an analysis of the affair titled Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers.[116] The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career,[117] especially in France.[118]\nIn 1985, during the Nicaraguan Contra War\u2014in which the U.S. supported the contra militia against the Sandinista government\u2014Chomsky traveled to Managua to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics.[119] Many of these lectures were published in 1987 as On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures.[120] In 1983 he published The Fateful Triangle, which argued that the U.S. had continually used the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict for its own ends.[121] In 1988, Chomsky visited the Palestinian territories to witness the impact of Israeli occupation.[122]\nIn 1988, Chomsky and Herman published Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, in which they outlined their propaganda model for understanding mainstream media. They argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news is censored through five filters that have great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented.[123] The book was inspired by Alex Carey and adapted into a 1992 film.[124] In 1989, Chomsky published Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies, in which he suggests that democratic citizens, to make a worthwhile democracy, undertake intellectual self-defense against the media and elite intellectual culture that seeks to control them.[125] By the 1980s, Chomsky's students had become prominent linguists who, in turn, expanded and revised his linguistic theories.[126]\nIn the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before.[127] Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance.[128] The lectures he gave on the subject were published as Powers and Prospects in 1996.[128] As a result of the international publicity Chomsky generated, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger.[129] After East Timor attained independence from Indonesia in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty.[130]\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed; Seven Stories Press collated and published these interviews that October.[131] Chomsky argued that the ensuing War on Terror was not a new development but a continuation of U.S. foreign policy and concomitant rhetoric since at least the Reagan era.[132] He gave the D.T. Lakdawala Memorial Lecture in New Delhi in 2001,[133] and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the Latin American Association of Social Scientists.[134] Chomsky's 2003 Hegemony or Survival articulated what he called the United States' \"imperial grand strategy\" and critiqued the Iraq War and other aspects of the War on Terror.[135] Chomsky toured internationally with greater regularity during this period.[134]\nChomsky retired from MIT in 2002,[136] but continued to conduct research and seminars on campus as an emeritus.[137] That same year he visited Turkey to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a co-defendant and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the charge on the first day.[138] During that trip Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favor of the Kurds' human rights.[138] A supporter of the World Social Forum, he attended its conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.[139]\nChomsky supported the Occupy movement, delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence: Occupy (2012), a pamphlet, and Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity (2013). He attributed Occupy's growth to a perception that the Democratic Party had abandoned the interests of the white working class.[140] In March 2014, Chomsky joined the advisory council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation,[141] an organization that advocates the global abolition of nuclear weapons, as a senior fellow.[142] The 2016 documentary Requiem for the American Dream summarizes his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a \"75-minute teach-in\".[143]\nIn 2017, Chomsky taught a short-term politics course at the University of Arizona in Tucson[144] and was later hired as a part-time professor in the linguistics department there, with his duties including teaching and public seminars.[145] His salary is covered by philanthropic donations.[146]\nChomsky signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins in 2018.[147][148]\nEdward Marcotte on the significance of Chomsky's linguistic theory[149]\nThe basis of Chomsky's linguistic theory lies in biolinguistics, the linguistic school that holds that the principles underpinning the structure of language are biologically preset in the human mind and hence genetically inherited.[150] As such he argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences.[151] In adopting this position Chomsky rejects the radical behaviorist psychology of B.\u00a0F. Skinner, who viewed behavior (including talking and thinking) as a completely learned product of the interactions between organisms and their environments. Accordingly, Chomsky argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and distinguished from modes of communication used by any other animal species.[152][153] Chomsky's nativist, internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of \"rationalism\" and contrasts with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language consistent with the philosophical school of \"empiricism\",[154] which contends that all knowledge, including language, comes from external stimuli.[149]\nSince the 1960s Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain language-specific features of their native languages. He bases his argument on observations about human language acquisition and describes a \"poverty of the stimulus\": an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic competence they attain. For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language.[155] To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the language acquisition device, and suggested that one of linguists' tasks should be to determine what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that result from these constraints would constitute \"universal grammar\".[156][157][158] Multiple scholars have challenged universal grammar on the grounds of the evolutionary infeasibility of its genetic basis for language,[159] the lack of universal characteristics between languages,[160] and the unproven link between innate/universal structures and the structures of specific languages.[161]\nTransformational-generative grammar is a broad theory used to model, encode, and deduce a native speaker's linguistic capabilities.[162] These models, or \"formal grammars\", show the abstract structures of a specific language as they may relate to structures in other languages.[163] Chomsky developed transformational grammar in the mid-1950s, whereupon it became the dominant syntactic theory in linguistics for two decades.[162] \"Transformations\" refers to syntactic relationships within language, e.g., being able to infer that the subject between two sentences is the same person.[164] Chomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures: Outward-facing surface structures relate phonetic rules into sound, while inward-facing deep structures relate words and conceptual meaning. Transformational-generative grammar uses mathematical notation to express the rules that govern the connection between meaning and sound (deep and surface structures, respectively). By this theory, linguistic principles can mathematically generate potential sentences structures in a language.[149] Scholar Michael Tomasello has challenged Chomsky's theory as based in logic and not empiricism.[165]\nBased on this rule-based notation of grammars,  Chomsky grouped natural languages into a series of four nested subsets and increasingly complex types, together known as the Chomsky hierarchy. This classification was and remains foundational to formal language theory,[166] and relevant to theoretical computer science, especially programming language theory,[167] compiler construction, and automata theory.[168]\nFollowing transformational grammar's heyday through the mid-1970s, a derivative[162] government and binding theory became a dominant research framework through the early 1990s (and remains an influential theory[162]) when linguists turned to a \"minimalist\" approach to grammar. This research focused on the principles and parameters framework, which explained children's ability to learn any language by filling open parameters (a set of universal grammar principles) that adapt as the child encounters linguistic data.[169] The minimalist program, initiated by Chomsky,[170] asks which minimal principles and parameters theory fits most elegantly, naturally, and simply.[169] In an attempt to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties, Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as \"deep structure\" and \"surface structure\" and instead emphasizes the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, with which come an infinite number of concepts, or \"logical forms\".[153] When exposed to linguistic data, a hearer-speaker's brain proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way language works. Thus while much of Chomsky's prior research focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms the brain uses to generate these rules and regulate speech.[153][171]\nJames McGilvray, 2014[172]\nChomsky is a prominent political dissident.[e] His political views have changed little since his childhood,[173] when he was influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working-class tradition.[174] He usually identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist.[175] He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet human needs: liberty, community, and freedom of association.[176] Unlike some other socialists, such as Marxists, Chomsky believes that politics lies outside the remit of science,[177] but he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories.[178]\nIn Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed by an elite corporatocracy, which uses corporate media, advertising, and think tanks to promote its own propaganda. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth they obscure.[179] Chomsky believes this web of falsehood can be broken by \"common sense\", critical thinking, and understanding the roles of self-interest and self-deception,[180] and that intellectuals abdicate their moral responsibility to tell the truth about the world in fear of losing prestige and funding.[181] He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his social privilege, resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.[182]\nAlthough he has joined protest marches and organized activist groups, Chomsky's primary political outlets are education and publication. He offers a wide range of political writings[183] as well as free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness.[184] He is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World international union.[185]\nChomsky has been a prominent critic of American imperialism;[186] he believes that the basic principle of the foreign policy of the United States is the establishment of \"open societies\" that are economically and politically controlled by the United States and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.[187] He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.[181] When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.[188] He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading Christianity; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.[189] Prominent examples he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.[189]\nChomsky's political work has centered heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States.[188] He has said he focuses on the U.S. because the country has militarily and economically dominated the world during his lifetime and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows the citizenry to influence government policy.[190] His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the impact U.S. foreign policies have on the populations affected by them, he can sway the populations of the U.S. and other countries into opposing the policies.[189] He urges people to criticize their governments' motivations, decisions, and actions, to accept responsibility for their own thoughts and actions, and to apply the same standards to others as to themselves.[191]\nChomsky has been critical of U.S. involvement in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.[181] Chomsky also criticizes the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, highlighting that Saudi Arabia has \"one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world\".[192]\nIn his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of capitalism and the pursuit of material wealth.[193] At the same time, he developed a disdain for authoritarian socialism, as represented by the Marxist\u2013Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.[194] Rather than accepting the common view among U.S. economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy and total private ownership, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy and total autocratic control (whether state or private).[195] He argues that Western capitalist countries are not really democratic,[196] because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.[197] He has stated his opposition to ruling elites, among them institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and GATT.[198]\nChomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the Bretton Woods financial control agreement.[199] He characterizes the U.S. as a de facto one-party state, viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic Party as manifestations of a single \"Business Party\" controlled by corporate and financial interests.[200] Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.[201]\nNoting the entrenchment of such an economic system, Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably.[201] Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions.[199] He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.[201]\nChomsky sees libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas as the descendants of the classical liberal ideas of the Age of Enlightenment,[202] arguing that his ideological position revolves around \"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being\".[203] He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of the means of production and government by workers' councils, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.[204] The point of this self-governance is to make each citizen, in Thomas Jefferson's words, \"a direct participator in the government of affairs.\"[205] He believes that there will be no need for political parties.[206] By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose.[207] He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.[208]\nChomsky criticizing Israel, 2012[209]\nChomsky has written prolifically on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aiming to raise public awareness of it.[210] He has long endorsed a left binationalist program in Israel and Palestine, seeking to create a democratic state in the Levant that is home to both Jews and Arabs.[211] Nevertheless, given the realpolitik of the situation, he has also considered a two-state solution on the condition that the nation-states exist on equal terms.[212] Chomsky was denied entry to the West Bank in 2010 because of his criticisms of Israel. He had been invited to deliver a lecture at Bir Zeit University and was to meet with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.[213][214][215][216] An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman later said that Chomsky was denied entry by mistake.[217]\nChomsky's political writings have largely focused on ideology, social and political power, the media, and state policy.[218] One of his best-known works, Manufacturing Consent, dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, by government-guided \"free market\" forces, is subtler and harder to undermine than was the equivalent propaganda system in the Soviet Union.[219] As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate-owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.[220] Acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the mass media's choices of topics and issues, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology:[221] although mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.[222] As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.[223] He also points to examples of important news stories that the U.S. mainstream media has ignored because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the country, including the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres in Nicaragua perpetrated by U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths without equivalent coverage of the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in that conflict.[224] To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.[225]\nChomsky considers most conspiracy theories fruitless, distracting substitutes for thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.[226] While not dismissing them outright, he considers them unproductive to challenging power in a substantial way. In response to the labeling of his own ideas as a conspiracy theory, Chomsky has said that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether General Motors would be accused of conspiracy if it deliberately selected what it used or discarded to sell its product.[227]\nChomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields, including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.[228] In these fields he is credited with ushering in the \"cognitive revolution\",[228] a significant paradigm shift that rejected logical positivism, the prevailing philosophical methodology of the time, and reframed how philosophers think about language and the mind.[170] Chomsky views the cognitive revolution as rooted in 17th-century rationalist ideals.[229] His position\u2014the idea that the mind contains inherent structures to understand language, perception, and thought\u2014has more in common with rationalism (Enlightenment and Cartesian) than behaviorism.[230] He named one of his key works Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966).[229] In philosophy of language, Chomsky is particularly known for his criticisms of the notion of reference and meaning in human language and his perspective on the nature and function of mental representations.[231]\nChomsky's famous 1971 debate on human nature with the French philosopher Michel Foucault was symbolic in positioning Chomsky as the prototypical analytic philosopher against Foucault, a stalwart of the continental tradition.[100] It showed what appeared to be irreconcilable differences between two moral and intellectual luminaries of the 20th century. Foucault's position was that of critique, that human nature could not be conceived in terms foreign to present understanding, while Chomsky held that human nature contained universalities such as a common standard of moral justice as deduced through reason based on what rationally serves human necessity.[232] Chomsky criticized postmodernism and French philosophy generally, arguing that the obscure language of postmodern, leftist philosophers gives little aid to the working classes.[233] He has also debated analytic philosophers, including Tyler Burge, Donald Davidson, Michael Dummett, Saul Kripke, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Willard Van Orman Quine, and John Searle.[170]\nChomsky's contributions span intellectual and world history, including history of philosophy.[234] Irony is a recurring characteristic of his writing, as he often implies that his readers know better, which can make them more engaged in the veracity of his claims.[235]\nChomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another,[236] calling himself \"scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom\".[237] An intensely private person,[238] he is uninterested in appearances and the fame his work has brought him.[239] He also has little interest in modern art and music.[240] McGilvray suggests that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so.[241] Chomsky acknowledges that his income affords him a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population;[242] nevertheless, he characterizes himself as a \"worker\", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.[243] He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the US, he subscribes to The Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Christian Science Monitor.[244] Chomsky is non-religious, but has expressed approval of forms of religion such as liberation theology.[245]\nChomsky has attracted controversy for calling established political and academic figures \"corrupt\", \"fascist\", and \"fraudulent\".[246] His colleague Steven Pinker has said that he \"portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric\", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions he receives from critics.[247] Chomsky avoids attending academic conferences, including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.[248] His approach to academic freedom has led him to support MIT academics whose actions he deplores; in 1969, when Chomsky heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was denied a position at MIT. In 1989, when Pentagon adviser John Deutch applied to be president of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, \"He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met. ... If somebody's got to be running the CIA, I'm glad it's him.\"[249]\nChomsky was married to Carol (n\u00e9e\u00a0Carol Doris Schatz) from 1949 until her death in 2008.[243] They had three children together: Aviva (b. 1957), Diane (b. 1960), and Harry (b. 1967).[250] In 2014, Chomsky married Valeria Wasserman.[251]\nSperlich, 2006[252]\nChomsky has been a defining Western intellectual figure, central to the field of linguistics and definitive in cognitive science, computer science, philosophy, and psychology.[253] In addition to being known as one of the most important intellectuals of his time,[f] Chomsky carries a dual legacy as both a \"leader in the field\" of linguistics and \"a figure of enlightenment and inspiration\" for political dissenters.[254] Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in his being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being \"on the outer margin of acceptability\".[255] The reception of his work is intertwined with his public image as an anarchist, a gadfly, an historian, a Jew, a linguist, and a philosopher.[9]\nMcGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the \"cognitive revolution\" in linguistics,[256] and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal, natural science,[257] moving it away from the procedural form of structural linguistics dominant during the mid-20th century.[258] As such, some have called Chomsky \"the father of modern linguistics\".[d] Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become \"the most dynamic and influential\" school of thought in the field.[259] By the 1970s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,[260] and a Minnesota State University Moorhead poll ranked Syntactic Structures as the single most important work in cognitive science.[261] In addition, his work in automata theory and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in computer science, and he is much cited in computational linguistics.[262][263][264]\nChomsky's criticisms of behaviorism contributed substantially to the decline of behaviorist psychology;[265] in addition, he is generally regarded as one of the primary founders of the field of cognitive science.[266][228] Some arguments in evolutionary psychology are derived from his research results;[267] Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in animal language acquisition at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.[268]\nACM Turing Award winner Donald Knuth credited Chomsky's work with helping him combine his interests in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science.[269] IBM computer scientist John Backus, another Turing Award winner, used some of Chomsky's concepts to help him develop FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level computer programming language.[270] The laureates of the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \u2014 Georges J. F. K\u00f6hler, C\u00e9sar Milstein, and Niels Kaj Jerne \u2014 used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system,[271] equating \"components of a generative grammar ... with various features of protein structures.\"[272] Chomsky's theory of generative grammar has also influenced work in music theory and analysis.[273][274][275]\nAn MIT press release stated that Chomsky was cited within the Arts and Humanities Citation Index more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992.[276] Chomsky was also extensively cited in the Social Sciences Citation Index and Science Citation Index during the same time period, with the librarian who conducted the research commenting that the statistics show that \"he is very widely read across disciplines and that his work is used by researchers across disciplines ... it seems that you can't write a paper without citing Noam Chomsky.\"[253] As a result of his influence, there are dueling camps of Chomskyan and non-Chomskyan linguistics, with the disputes between the two camps often acrimonious.[277]\nChomsky's status as the \"most-quoted living author\" is credited to his political writings, which vastly outnumber his writings on linguistics.[278] Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes him as \"one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people\";[238] journalist John Pilger has described him as a \"genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins\u2014activists and movements\u2014he's unfailingly supportive.\"[247] Arundhati Roy has called him \"one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time\",[279] and Edward Said thought him \"one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions\".[247] Fred Halliday has said that by the start of the 21st century Chomsky had become a \"guru\" for the world's anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.[247] The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media,[280] also exerting a significant influence on the growth of alternative media, including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.[281]\nSperlich also notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.[137] University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their undergraduate syllabi.[282] Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas; he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so.[182] According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics \"do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text\".[182]\nChomsky drew criticism for not calling the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnian War a \"genocide\", which he said would devalue the word,[283] and in appearing to deny Ed Vulliamy's reporting on the existence of Bosnian concentration camps. The subsequent editorial correction of his comments, viewed as a capitulation, was criticized by multiple Balkan watchers.[284]\nChomsky's far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored his activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point, possibly in violation of federal law.[285] He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, but has refused uniformed police protection.[286] German newspaper Der Spiegel described Chomsky as \"the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred\",[137] while conservative commentator David Horowitz called him \"the most devious, the most dishonest and\u00a0... the most treacherous intellect in America\", whose work is infused with \"anti-American dementia\" and evidences his \"pathological hatred of his own country\".[287] Writing in Commentary magazine, the journalist Jonathan Kay described Chomsky as \"a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says\".[288]\nChomsky's criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an anti-Semite.[289] Criticizing Chomsky's defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, Werner Cohn called Chomsky \"the most important patron\" of the neo-Nazi movement.[290] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which has been accused of monitoring Chomsky's activities,[291] called him a Holocaust denier,[292] describing him as a \"dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims\".[292] In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by \"Stalinist types\" who oppose democracy in Israel.[289] The lawyer Alan Dershowitz has called Chomsky a \"false prophet of the left\";[293] Chomsky called Dershowitz \"a complete liar\" who is on \"a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation\".[294] In early 2016 President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an open letter condemning Erdo\u011fan for his anti-Kurdish repression and double standards on terrorism.[295] Chomsky accused Erdo\u011fan of hypocrisy, noting that Erdo\u011fan supports al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate,[296] the al-Nusra Front.[295]\nIn 1970, the London Times named Chomsky one of the \"makers of the twentieth century\".[149] He was voted the world's leading public intellectual in The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll jointly conducted by American magazine Foreign Policy and British magazine Prospect.[297] New Statesman readers listed Chomsky among the world's foremost heroes in 2006.[298]\nIn the United States he is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Linguistic Society of America, the American Philosophical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[299] Abroad he is a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, an honorary member of the British Psychological Society, a member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina,[299] and a foreign member of the Department of Social Sciences of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.[300] He received a 1971 Guggenheim Fellowship, the 1984 American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology, the 1988 Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences, the 1996 Helmholtz Medal,[299] the 1999 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science,[301] the 2010 Erich Fromm Prize,[302] and the British Academy's 2014 Neil and Saras Smith Medal for Linguistics.[303] He is also a two-time winner of the NCTE George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language (1987 and 1989).[299] He has also received the Rabindranath Tagore Centenary Award from The Asiatic Society.[304]\nChomsky received the 2004 Carl-von-Ossietzky Prize from the city of Oldenburg, Germany, to acknowledge his body of work as a political analyst and media critic.[305] He received an honorary fellowship in 2005 from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin.[306] He received the 2008 President's Medal from the Literary and Debating Society of the National University of Ireland, Galway.[307] Since 2009, he has been an honorary member of International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters (IAPTI).[308] He received the University of Wisconsin's A.E. Havens Center's Award for Lifetime Contribution to Critical Scholarship[309] and was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems' AI's Hall of Fame for \"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems.\"[310] Chomsky has an Erd\u0151s number of four.[311]\nIn 2011, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded Chomsky the US Peace Prize for antiwar activities over five decades.[312] For his work in human rights, peace, and social criticism, he received the 2011 Sydney Peace Prize,[313] the 2017 Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize[314] and the Dorothy Eldridge Peacemaker Award.[301]\nChomsky has received honorary doctorates from institutions including the University of London and the University of Chicago (1967), Loyola University Chicago and Swarthmore College (1970), Bard College (1971), Delhi University (1972), and the University of Massachusetts (1973) among others.[98] His public lectures have included the 1969 John Locke Lectures,[301] 1975 Whidden Lectures,[99] 1977 Huizinga Lecture, and 1988 Massey Lectures, among others.[301]\nVarious tributes to Chomsky have been dedicated over the years. He is the eponym for a bee species,[315] a frog species,[316] and a building complex at the Indian university Jamia Millia Islamia.[317] Actor Viggo Mortensen and avant-garde guitarist Buckethead dedicated their 2003 album Pandemoniumfromamerica to Chomsky.[318]\nLinguistics\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nCornelius Crane \u201cChevy\u201d Chase (/\u02c8t\u0283\u025bvi/; born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. Born into a prominent New York family,[citation needed] Chase had a variety of jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with National Lampoon. He became a key cast member in the first season of Saturday Night Live, where his recurring Weekend Update segment soon became a staple of the show. As both a performer and writer, he earned three Primetime Emmy Awards out of five nominations.[1] Chase had his first leading film role in the comedy Foul Play (1978), earning two Golden Globe Award nominations.[2] He is further known for his portrayals of Clark W. Griswold in five National Lampoon's Vacation films and Irwin \"Fletch\" Fletcher in both Fletch (1985) and Fletch Lives (1989). Other prominent titles include Caddyshack (1980), Seems Like Old Times (1980), Spies Like Us (1985), Three Amigos (1986), Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), Orange County (2002), and Hot Tub Time Machine (2010). He has hosted the Academy Awards twice (1987 and 1988) and briefly had his own late-night talk show, The Chevy Chase Show (1993). He played the character Pierce Hawthorne on the NBC comedy series Community from 2009 to 2014.[3][4] Cornelius Chase was born on October 8, 1943,[5] in Lower Manhattan, New York, and grew up in Woodstock, New York.[6] His father, Edward Tinsley \"Ned\" Chase (1919\u20132005),[7] was a Princeton-educated, prominent Manhattan book editor and magazine writer.[8] His mother, Cathalene Parker (n\u00e9e Browning; 1923\u20132005), was a concert pianist and librettist whose father Admiral Miles Browning served as Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's Chief of Staff on the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6) at the Battle of Midway in World War II. Cathalene was adopted as a child by her stepfather, Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane, heir to The Crane Company, and took the name Catherine Crane.[9] Chase's paternal grandfather was artist and illustrator Edward Leigh Chase, and his great-uncle was painter and teacher Frank Swift Chase. His maternal grandmother, Cathalene, was an opera singer who performed several times at Carnegie Hall.[10] Chase was named for his adoptive grandfather Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane, while the nickname \"Chevy\" was bestowed by his grandmother, derived from the medieval English ballad \"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\". As a descendant of the Scottish Clan Douglas, the name seemed appropriate to her.[11] He is a 14th-generation New Yorker, and was listed in the Social Register at an early age. His mother's ancestors arrived in Manhattan starting in 1624\u2014among his ancestors are New York City mayors Stephanus Van Cortlandt and John Johnstone; the Dutch Schuyler family, through his ancestor Gertrude Schuyler, the wife of Stephanus Van Cortlandt; John Morin Scott, General of the New York Militia during the American Revolution; Anne Hutchinson, dissident Puritan preacher and healer; and Mayflower passengers and signers of the Mayflower Compact from England, John Howland,[12] and the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony, William Brewster. According to his brother John: As a child, Chase vacationed at Castle Hill, the Cranes' summer estate in Ipswich, Massachusetts.[13] Chase's parents divorced when he was four; his father remarried into the Folgers coffee family, and his mother remarried twice. He has stated that he grew up in an upper middle class environment and that his adoptive maternal grandfather did not bequeath any assets to Chase's mother when he died.[14] In a 2007 biography, Chase stated that he was physically and psychologically abused as a child by his mother and stepfather, John Cederquist.[15] Both of his parents died in 2005. Chase was educated at Riverdale Country School,[16] an independent day school in the Riverdale neighborhood of New York City, before being expelled. He ultimately graduated from the Stockbridge School,[17] an independent boarding school in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He attended Haverford College during the 1962\u20131963 term, where he was noted for slapstick comedy and an absurd sense of physical humor, including his signature pratfalls and \"sticking forks into his orifices.\"[18] During a 2009 interview on the Today show, he ostensibly verified the oft-publicized urban legend that he was expelled for harboring a cow in his fourth floor room,[19] although his former roommate David Felson asserted in a 2003 interview that Chase left for academic reasons.[18] Chase transferred to Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where he studied a pre-med curriculum and graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. Chase did not enter medical school, which meant he was subject to the military draft. Chase was not drafted; when he appeared in January 1989 as the first guest of the just-launched late-night The Pat Sajak Show, he said he had convinced his draft board he deserved a 4-F classification by \"falsely claiming, among other things, that he had homosexual tendencies.\"[20] Chase played drums with the college band The Leather Canary, headed by school friends Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Chase has called the group \"a bad jazz band\"; Becker and Fagen later founded the successful group Steely Dan. Chase has absolute pitch.[11] He played drums and keyboards for a rock band called Chamaeleon Church, which recorded one album for MGM Records before disbanding in 1969. To give the album a more soft-rock sound, producer Alan Lorber made several alterations in the mixing, including the muting of Chase's bass drum, and Chase was reportedly incensed when he heard the final mix.[21] Before fame, Chase worked as a cab driver, truck driver, motorcycle messenger, construction worker, waiter, busboy, fruit picker, produce manager in a supermarket, audio engineer, salesman in a wine store, and theater usher. Chase was a member of an early underground comedy ensemble called Channel One which he co-founded in 1967. He also wrote a one-page spoof on Mission: Impossible for Mad magazine in 1970 and was a writer for the short-lived Smothers Brothers TV show comeback in the spring of 1975. Chase made the move to comedy as a full-time career by 1973, when he became a writer and cast member of The National Lampoon Radio Hour, a syndicated satirical radio series. The National Lampoon Radio Hour also featured John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, and Brian Doyle-Murray, all of whom later became \"Not-Ready-For-Prime Time Players\" on NBC Saturday Night (later retitled NBC's Saturday Night and finally Saturday Night Live). Chase and Belushi also appeared in National Lampoon's off-Broadway revue Lemmings, a sketch and musical send-up of popular youth culture, in which Chase also played the drums and piano during the musical numbers. He appeared in the movie The Groove Tube which was directed by another co-founder of Channel One, Ken Shapiro, featuring several Channel One sketches. Chase was one of the original cast members of Saturday Night Live (SNL), NBC's late-night comedy television show, beginning in October 1975. During the first season, he introduced every show except two, with \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" The remark was often preceded by a pratfall, known as \"The Fall of the Week.\" Chase became known for his skill at physical comedy. In one comedy sketch, he mimicked a real-life incident in which President Gerald Ford accidentally tripped while disembarking from Air Force One in Salzburg, Austria.[22][23] This portrayal of President Ford, as a bumbling klutz, became a favorite device of Chase and helped form the popular concept of Ford as being a clumsy man.[24] In later years, Chase met and became friendly with President Ford.[25][26] Chase was the original anchor for the Weekend Update segment of SNL, and his catchphrase introduction, \"I'm Chevy Chase\u2026 and you're not\" became well known. His trademark conclusion, \"Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow\" was later resurrected by Jane Curtin and Tina Fey. Chase also wrote comedy material for Weekend Update. For example, he wrote and performed \"The News for the Hard of Hearing.\" In this skit, Chase read the top story of the day, aided by Garrett Morris, who repeated the story by loudly shouting it. Chase claimed that his version of Weekend Update was the inspiration for later news satire shows such as The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.[27] Weekend Update was later revived as a segment on The Chevy Chase Show,[28] a short-lived late-night talk show produced by Chase and broadcast by Fox Broadcasting Company. Chase was committed contractually to SNL for only one year as a writer, and became a cast member during rehearsals just before the show's premiere. He received two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for his comedy writing and live comic acting on the show. In Rolling Stone's February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date, Chase was ranked tenth in overall importance. \"Strange as it sounds, Chase might be the most under-rated SNL player,\" they wrote. \"It took him only one season to define the franchise\u2026without that deadpan arrogance, the whole SNL style of humor would fall flat.\"[29] In a 1975 New York magazine cover story, which called him \"The funniest man in America,\" NBC executives referred to Chase as \"The first real potential successor to Johnny Carson\" and claimed he would begin guest-hosting The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson within six months of the article. Chase dismissed chatter that he could be the next Carson by telling New York, \"I'd never be tied down for five years interviewing TV personalities.\" Chase did not appear on the program until May 4, 1977, when he was promoting a prime-time special for NBC. Carson later said of Chase; \"He couldn't ad lib a fart after a baked bean dinner.\"[30] Chase acknowledged Ernie Kovacs's influence on his work in Saturday Night Live,[31] and he thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy Award.[32] In addition, Chase spoke of Kovacs's influence on his work in an appearance in the 1982 documentary called Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius.[33] In late 1976, in the middle of the second season, Chase became the first member of the original cast to leave the show. While he landed starring roles in several films on the strength of his SNL notoriety, he asserted that the principal reason for his departure was his girlfriend Jacqueline Carlin's reluctance to move to New York.[34] Chase moved to Los Angeles, married Carlin, and was replaced by Bill Murray, although he made a few appearances on the show during the second season. Chase later hosted SNL eight times through 1997. He appeared on the show's 25th anniversary special in 1999, and was interviewed for a 2005 NBC special on the first five years of SNL. Later appearances included a Caddyshack skit featuring Bill Murray, a 1997 episode with guest host Chris Farley, as the Land Shark in a Weekend Update segment in 2001, another Weekend Update segment in 2007, and in Justin Timberlake's monologue in 2013 as a member of the Five-Timers Club, where he was reunited with his Three Amigos co-stars Steve Martin and Martin Short. He also participated in the 40th anniversary special in February 2015.[35] Chase's early film roles included Tunnel Vision, the box office hit Foul Play, and Oh! Heavenly Dog. The role of Eric \"Otter\" Stratton in National Lampoon's Animal House was originally written with Chase in mind, but he turned the role down to work on Foul Play.[14] The role went to Tim Matheson instead. Chase said in an interview that he chose to do Foul Play so he could do \"real acting\" for the first time in his career instead of just doing \"schtick.\"[36] Chase followed Foul Play with the successful Harold Ramis comedy Caddyshack, in 1980. That same year, he also reunited with Foul Play co-star Goldie Hawn for Neil Simon's Seems Like Old Times and released a self-titled record album, co-produced by Chase and Tom Scott, with novelty and cover versions of songs by Randy Newman, Barry White, Bob Marley, the Beatles, Donna Summer, Tennessee Ernie Ford, The Troggs, and The Sugarhill Gang. Chase narrowly escaped death by electrocution during the filming of Modern Problems in 1980. During a sequence in which Chase's character wears \"landing lights\" as he dreams that he is an airplane, the lights malfunctioned and electrical current passed through Chase's arm, back, and neck muscles. The near-death experience caused Chase to experience a period of deep depression, as his marriage to Jacqueline had ended just prior to the start of filming. Chase continued his film career in 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation, directed by Ramis and written by John Hughes. He married Jayni Luke in 1982, and in 1985, he starred in Fletch, the first of two films based on Gregory Mcdonald's Fletch books as well as Spies Like Us. Chase joined SNL veterans Steve Martin and Martin Short in the Lorne Michaels\u2013produced comedy Three Amigos in 1986, declaring in an interview that making Three Amigos was the most fun he had making a film. The trio hosted SNL that year, the only time the show has had three hosts on one show. At the height of his career in the late 1980s, Chase earned around US$7\u00a0million per film and was a highly visible celebrity. He appeared alongside Paul Simon, one of his best friends, in Simon's 1986 second video for \"You Can Call Me Al,\" in which he lip-syncs all of Simon's lyrics. Chase hosted the Academy Awards in 1987 and 1988, signing on to the proceedings in 1988 with the opener, \"Good evening, Hollywood phonies!\" Chase filmed a sequel to Vacation, 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation and then a third, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, in 1989, which, thanks to its holiday theme, has become one of his more durable films, airing on NBC every December. He played saxophone onstage at Simon's free concert at the Great Lawn in Central Park in the summer of 1991. Later in 1991, he helped record and appeared in the music video \"Voices That Care\" to entertain and support U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm, and supported the International Red Cross. Chase's career took a downturn in the early to mid-1990s. Chase had three consecutive film flops\u20141991's Razzie Award\u2013nominated Nothing but Trouble, 1992's Memoirs of an Invisible Man, and 1994's Cops & Robbersons. The three releases had a combined gross of $34\u00a0million in the United States. Even the durable Vacation series ground to a halt, following 1997's Vegas Vacation installment. Some of the more recent films starring Chase (e.g., Vacuums, Rent-a-Husband, Goose!) have not been widely released in the United States. He returned to mainstream movie-making in 2006, co-starring with Tim Allen and Courteney Cox in the comedy Zoom, though it was both a critical and commercial failure. In September 1993, Chase hosted The Chevy Chase Show, a weeknight talk show, for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Although it had high commercial expectations, the show was cancelled by Fox after five weeks. Chase later appeared in a commercial for Doritos, airing during the Super Bowl, in which he made humorous reference to the show's failure. Chase was Hasty Pudding's 1993 Man of the Year, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. After having starred with Farrah Fawcett in the relatively successful Man of the House in 1995, he received The Harvard Lampoon's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.[37] He was roasted by the New York Friars Club for a Comedy Central television special in 2002. This roast was noted for being unusually vitriolic, even by the standards of a roast. [38] In 2005, Chase was the keynote speaker at Princeton University's Class Day, part of commencement activities. On March 20, 2012, Dan Aykroyd announced through his Facebook page that he is working with Chase on a script for a new comedy that would star the two actors.[39] In 2015, Chase reprised his role as Clark Griswold in the fifth Vacation installment, titled Vacation. Unlike the previous four films in which Clark is the main protagonist, he only has a brief though pivotal cameo appearance. In spite of largely negative critical reception, the film itself has proven to be a financial success grossing over $104\u00a0million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing entry to date. Chase guest-starred as an anti-Semitic murder suspect in \"In Vino Veritas,\" the November 3, 2006, episode of Law & Order. He also guest-starred in the ABC drama series Brothers & Sisters in two episodes as a former love interest of Sally Field's character. Chase appeared in a prominent recurring role as villainous software magnate Ted Roark on the NBC spy-comedy Chuck. In 2009, Chase and Dan Aykroyd provided voices for the Family Guy episode \"Spies Reminiscent of Us.\" Chase starred in the NBC sitcom Community, as aging moist-towelette tycoon Pierce Hawthorne, starting in 2009. However, Chase left the show in 2012 after completing the majority of the episodes of season four. He returned for a cameo appearance in the season-five premiere. Although he had sometimes been involved in public disputes with creator Dan Harmon over the direction of the show, the role was nevertheless his most prominent in many years. In 2010, he appeared in the film Hot Tub Time Machine, as well as a short online film featuring the Griswold Family, and in the Funny or Die original comedy sketch \"Presidential Reunion,\" where he played President Ford alongside other current and former SNL president impersonators. 2019 saw him in the Netflix movie The Last Laugh. Chase has appeared in a number of television commercials, including Dollar Rent-a-Car (1996), Doritos (1996), History Channel (1999), a series of commercials for AAMI Insurance (Australia, 1999),[40][41][42] Aflac (2003), Cola Turka (2003), T-Mobile (2009), and Chase Manhattan Bank (2010).[43] Chase married Susan Hewitt on February 23, 1973, in New York City. They divorced three years later, on February 1, 1976. His second marriage to Jacqueline Carlin was formalized on December 4, 1976. They divorced on November 14, 1980.[44] He married his third and current wife, Jayni Luke, on June 19, 1982, in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles.[45] In 1986, Chase was admitted to the Betty Ford Clinic for treatment of an addiction to prescription painkillers. His use of these drugs began after he experienced ongoing back pain related to the pratfalls he took during his Saturday Night Live appearances.[46] In 2010, he said that his drug abuse had been \"low level.\"[47] He entered Minnesota's Hazelden Clinic in September 2016 for treatment of an alcohol-related issue.[48] Chase is an active environmentalist, charity fundraiser, and liberal. He raised money for Bill Clinton in the 1990s and John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential Election. Following the 2004 elections, Chase mocked President George W. Bush during a speech at a People for the American Way benefit at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, referring to the President as an \"uneducated, real lying schmuck\" and a \"dumb fuck.\"[49]",

He became a key cast member in the first season of Saturday Night Live, where his recurring Weekend Update segment soon became a staple of the show. As both a performer and writer, he earned three Primetime Emmy Awards out of five nominations.[1]\nChase had his first leading film role in the comedy Foul Play (1978), earning two Golden Globe Award nominations.[2] He is further known for his portrayals of Clark W. Griswold in five National Lampoon's Vacation films and Irwin \"Fletch\" Fletcher in both Fletch (1985) and Fletch Lives (1989). Other prominent titles include Caddyshack (1980), Seems Like Old Times (1980), Spies Like Us (1985), Three Amigos (1986), Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), Orange County (2002), and Hot Tub Time Machine (2010). He has hosted the Academy Awards twice (1987 and 1988) and briefly had his own late-night talk show, The Chevy Chase Show (1993). He played the character Pierce Hawthorne on the NBC comedy series Community from 2009 to 2014.[3][4]\nCornelius Chase was born on October 8, 1943,[5] in Lower Manhattan, New York, and grew up in Woodstock, New York.[6] His father, Edward Tinsley \"Ned\" Chase (1919\u20132005),[7] was a Princeton-educated, prominent Manhattan book editor and magazine writer.[8] His mother, Cathalene Parker (n\u00e9e Browning; 1923\u20132005), was a concert pianist and librettist whose father Admiral Miles Browning served as Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's Chief of Staff on the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6) at the Battle of Midway in World War II. Cathalene was adopted as a child by her stepfather, Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane, heir to The Crane Company, and took the name Catherine Crane.[9] Chase's paternal grandfather was artist and illustrator Edward Leigh Chase, and his great-uncle was painter and teacher Frank Swift Chase. His maternal grandmother, Cathalene, was an opera singer who performed several times at Carnegie Hall.[10]\nChase was named for his adoptive grandfather Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane, while the nickname \"Chevy\" was bestowed by his grandmother, derived from the medieval English ballad \"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\". As a descendant of the Scottish Clan Douglas, the name seemed appropriate to her.[11] He is a 14th-generation New Yorker, and was listed in the Social Register at an early age. His mother's ancestors arrived in Manhattan starting in 1624\u2014among his ancestors are New York City mayors Stephanus Van Cortlandt and John Johnstone; the Dutch Schuyler family, through his ancestor Gertrude Schuyler, the wife of Stephanus Van Cortlandt; John Morin Scott, General of the New York Militia during the American Revolution; Anne Hutchinson, dissident Puritan preacher and healer; and Mayflower passengers and signers of the Mayflower Compact from England, John Howland,[12] and the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony, William Brewster. According to his brother John:\nAs a child, Chase vacationed at Castle Hill, the Cranes' summer estate in Ipswich, Massachusetts.[13] Chase's parents divorced when he was four; his father remarried into the Folgers coffee family, and his mother remarried twice. He has stated that he grew up in an upper middle class environment and that his adoptive maternal grandfather did not bequeath any assets to Chase's mother when he died.[14] In a 2007 biography, Chase stated that he was physically and psychologically abused as a child by his mother and stepfather, John Cederquist.[15] Both of his parents died in 2005.\nChase was educated at Riverdale Country School,[16] an independent day school in the Riverdale neighborhood of New York City, before being expelled. He ultimately graduated from the Stockbridge School,[17] an independent boarding school in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He attended Haverford College during the 1962\u20131963 term, where he was noted for slapstick comedy and an absurd sense of physical humor, including his signature pratfalls and \"sticking forks into his orifices.\"[18] During a 2009 interview on the Today show, he ostensibly verified the oft-publicized urban legend that he was expelled for harboring a cow in his fourth floor room,[19] although his former roommate David Felson asserted in a 2003 interview that Chase left for academic reasons.[18] Chase transferred to Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where he studied a pre-med curriculum and graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.\nChase did not enter medical school, which meant he was subject to the military draft. Chase was not drafted; when he appeared in January 1989 as the first guest of the just-launched late-night The Pat Sajak Show, he said he had convinced his draft board he deserved a 4-F classification by \"falsely claiming, among other things, that he had homosexual tendencies.\"[20]\nChase played drums with the college band The Leather Canary, headed by school friends Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Chase has called the group \"a bad jazz band\"; Becker and Fagen later founded the successful group Steely Dan. Chase has absolute pitch.[11] He played drums and keyboards for a rock band called Chamaeleon Church, which recorded one album for MGM Records before disbanding in 1969. To give the album a more soft-rock sound, producer Alan Lorber made several alterations in the mixing, including the muting of Chase's bass drum, and Chase was reportedly incensed when he heard the final mix.[21] Before fame, Chase worked as a cab driver, truck driver, motorcycle messenger, construction worker, waiter, busboy, fruit picker, produce manager in a supermarket, audio engineer, salesman in a wine store, and theater usher.\nChase was a member of an early underground comedy ensemble called Channel One which he co-founded in 1967. He also wrote a one-page spoof on Mission: Impossible for Mad magazine in 1970 and was a writer for the short-lived Smothers Brothers TV show comeback in the spring of 1975. Chase made the move to comedy as a full-time career by 1973, when he became a writer and cast member of The National Lampoon Radio Hour, a syndicated satirical radio series. The National Lampoon Radio Hour also featured John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, and Brian Doyle-Murray, all of whom later became \"Not-Ready-For-Prime Time Players\" on NBC Saturday Night (later retitled NBC's Saturday Night and finally Saturday Night Live). Chase and Belushi also appeared in National Lampoon's off-Broadway revue Lemmings, a sketch and musical send-up of popular youth culture, in which Chase also played the drums and piano during the musical numbers. He appeared in the movie The Groove Tube which was directed by another co-founder of Channel One, Ken Shapiro, featuring several Channel One sketches.\nChase was one of the original cast members of Saturday Night Live (SNL), NBC's late-night comedy television show, beginning in October 1975. During the first season, he introduced every show except two, with \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" The remark was often preceded by a pratfall, known as \"The Fall of the Week.\" Chase became known for his skill at physical comedy. In one comedy sketch, he mimicked a real-life incident in which President Gerald Ford accidentally tripped while disembarking from Air Force One in Salzburg, Austria.[22][23] This portrayal of President Ford, as a bumbling klutz, became a favorite device of Chase and helped form the popular concept of Ford as being a clumsy man.[24] In later years, Chase met and became friendly with President Ford.[25][26]\nChase was the original anchor for the Weekend Update segment of SNL, and his catchphrase introduction, \"I'm Chevy Chase\u2026 and you're not\" became well known. His trademark conclusion, \"Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow\" was later resurrected by Jane Curtin and Tina Fey. Chase also wrote comedy material for Weekend Update. For example, he wrote and performed \"The News for the Hard of Hearing.\" In this skit, Chase read the top story of the day, aided by Garrett Morris, who repeated the story by loudly shouting it. Chase claimed that his version of Weekend Update was the inspiration for later news satire shows such as The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.[27] Weekend Update was later revived as a segment on The Chevy Chase Show,[28] a short-lived late-night talk show produced by Chase and broadcast by Fox Broadcasting Company.\nChase was committed contractually to SNL for only one year as a writer, and became a cast member during rehearsals just before the show's premiere. He received two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for his comedy writing and live comic acting on the show. In Rolling Stone's February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date, Chase was ranked tenth in overall importance. \"Strange as it sounds, Chase might be the most under-rated SNL player,\" they wrote. \"It took him only one season to define the franchise\u2026without that deadpan arrogance, the whole SNL style of humor would fall flat.\"[29]\nIn a 1975 New York magazine cover story, which called him \"The funniest man in America,\" NBC executives referred to Chase as \"The first real potential successor to Johnny Carson\" and claimed he would begin guest-hosting The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson within six months of the article. Chase dismissed chatter that he could be the next Carson by telling New York, \"I'd never be tied down for five years interviewing TV personalities.\" Chase did not appear on the program until May 4, 1977, when he was promoting a prime-time special for NBC. Carson later said of Chase; \"He couldn't ad lib a fart after a baked bean dinner.\"[30]\nChase acknowledged Ernie Kovacs's influence on his work in Saturday Night Live,[31] and he thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy Award.[32] In addition, Chase spoke of Kovacs's influence on his work in an appearance in the 1982 documentary called Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius.[33]\nIn late 1976, in the middle of the second season, Chase became the first member of the original cast to leave the show. While he landed starring roles in several films on the strength of his SNL notoriety, he asserted that the principal reason for his departure was his girlfriend Jacqueline Carlin's reluctance to move to New York.[34] Chase moved to Los Angeles, married Carlin, and was replaced by Bill Murray, although he made a few appearances on the show during the second season.\nChase later hosted SNL eight times through 1997. He appeared on the show's 25th anniversary special in 1999, and was interviewed for a 2005 NBC special on the first five years of SNL. Later appearances included a Caddyshack skit featuring Bill Murray, a 1997 episode with guest host Chris Farley, as the Land Shark in a Weekend Update segment in 2001, another Weekend Update segment in 2007, and in Justin Timberlake's monologue in 2013 as a member of the Five-Timers Club, where he was reunited with his Three Amigos co-stars Steve Martin and Martin Short. He also participated in the 40th anniversary special in February 2015.[35]\nChase's early film roles included Tunnel Vision, the box office hit Foul Play, and Oh! Heavenly Dog. The role of Eric \"Otter\" Stratton in National Lampoon's Animal House was originally written with Chase in mind, but he turned the role down to work on Foul Play.[14] The role went to Tim Matheson instead. Chase said in an interview that he chose to do Foul Play so he could do \"real acting\" for the first time in his career instead of just doing \"schtick.\"[36] Chase followed Foul Play with the successful Harold Ramis comedy Caddyshack, in 1980. That same year, he also reunited with Foul Play co-star Goldie Hawn for Neil Simon's Seems Like Old Times and released a self-titled record album, co-produced by Chase and Tom Scott, with novelty and cover versions of songs by Randy Newman, Barry White, Bob Marley, the Beatles, Donna Summer, Tennessee Ernie Ford, The Troggs, and The Sugarhill Gang.\nChase narrowly escaped death by electrocution during the filming of Modern Problems in 1980. During a sequence in which Chase's character wears \"landing lights\" as he dreams that he is an airplane, the lights malfunctioned and electrical current passed through Chase's arm, back, and neck muscles. The near-death experience caused Chase to experience a period of deep depression, as his marriage to Jacqueline had ended just prior to the start of filming. Chase continued his film career in 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation, directed by Ramis and written by John Hughes. He married Jayni Luke in 1982, and in 1985, he starred in Fletch, the first of two films based on Gregory Mcdonald's Fletch books as well as Spies Like Us. Chase joined SNL veterans Steve Martin and Martin Short in the Lorne Michaels\u2013produced comedy Three Amigos in 1986, declaring in an interview that making Three Amigos was the most fun he had making a film. The trio hosted SNL that year, the only time the show has had three hosts on one show.\nAt the height of his career in the late 1980s, Chase earned around US$7\u00a0million per film and was a highly visible celebrity. He appeared alongside Paul Simon, one of his best friends, in Simon's 1986 second video for \"You Can Call Me Al,\" in which he lip-syncs all of Simon's lyrics. Chase hosted the Academy Awards in 1987 and 1988, signing on to the proceedings in 1988 with the opener, \"Good evening, Hollywood phonies!\" Chase filmed a sequel to Vacation, 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation and then a third, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, in 1989, which, thanks to its holiday theme, has become one of his more durable films, airing on NBC every December. He played saxophone onstage at Simon's free concert at the Great Lawn in Central Park in the summer of 1991. Later in 1991, he helped record and appeared in the music video \"Voices That Care\" to entertain and support U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm, and supported the International Red Cross.\nChase's career took a downturn in the early to mid-1990s. Chase had three consecutive film flops\u20141991's Razzie Award\u2013nominated Nothing but Trouble, 1992's Memoirs of an Invisible Man, and 1994's Cops &amp; Robbersons. The three releases had a combined gross of $34\u00a0million in the United States. Even the durable Vacation series ground to a halt, following 1997's Vegas Vacation installment. Some of the more recent films starring Chase (e.g., Vacuums, Rent-a-Husband, Goose!) have not been widely released in the United States. He returned to mainstream movie-making in 2006, co-starring with Tim Allen and Courteney Cox in the comedy Zoom, though it was both a critical and commercial failure.\nIn September 1993, Chase hosted The Chevy Chase Show, a weeknight talk show, for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Although it had high commercial expectations, the show was cancelled by Fox after five weeks. Chase later appeared in a commercial for Doritos, airing during the Super Bowl, in which he made humorous reference to the show's failure.\nChase was Hasty Pudding's 1993 Man of the Year, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. After having starred with Farrah Fawcett in the relatively successful Man of the House in 1995, he received The Harvard Lampoon's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.\nIn 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.[37]\nHe was roasted by the New York Friars Club for a Comedy Central television special in 2002. This roast was noted for being unusually vitriolic, even by the standards of a roast. [38]\nIn 2005, Chase was the keynote speaker at Princeton University's Class Day, part of commencement activities.\nOn March 20, 2012, Dan Aykroyd announced through his Facebook page that he is working with Chase on a script for a new comedy that would star the two actors.[39]\nIn 2015, Chase reprised his role as Clark Griswold in the fifth Vacation installment, titled Vacation. Unlike the previous four films in which Clark is the main protagonist, he only has a brief though pivotal cameo appearance. In spite of largely negative critical reception, the film itself has proven to be a financial success grossing over $104\u00a0million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing entry to date.\nChase guest-starred as an anti-Semitic murder suspect in \"In Vino Veritas,\" the November 3, 2006, episode of Law &amp; Order. He also guest-starred in the ABC drama series Brothers &amp; Sisters in two episodes as a former love interest of Sally Field's character. Chase appeared in a prominent recurring role as villainous software magnate Ted Roark on the NBC spy-comedy Chuck. In 2009, Chase and Dan Aykroyd provided voices for the Family Guy episode \"Spies Reminiscent of Us.\"\nChase starred in the NBC sitcom Community, as aging moist-towelette tycoon Pierce Hawthorne, starting in 2009. However, Chase left the show in 2012 after completing the majority of the episodes of season four. He returned for a cameo appearance in the season-five premiere. Although he had sometimes been involved in public disputes with creator Dan Harmon over the direction of the show, the role was nevertheless his most prominent in many years.\nIn 2010, he appeared in the film Hot Tub Time Machine, as well as a short online film featuring the Griswold Family, and in the Funny or Die original comedy sketch \"Presidential Reunion,\" where he played President Ford alongside other current and former SNL president impersonators. 2019 saw him in the Netflix movie The Last Laugh.\nChase has appeared in a number of television commercials, including Dollar Rent-a-Car (1996), Doritos (1996), History Channel (1999), a series of commercials for AAMI Insurance (Australia, 1999),[40][41][42] Aflac (2003), Cola Turka (2003), T-Mobile (2009), and Chase Manhattan Bank (2010).[43]\nChase married Susan Hewitt on February 23, 1973, in New York City. They divorced three years later, on February 1, 1976. His second marriage to Jacqueline Carlin was formalized on December 4, 1976. They divorced on November 14, 1980.[44] He married his third and current wife, Jayni Luke, on June 19, 1982, in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles.[45]\nIn 1986, Chase was admitted to the Betty Ford Clinic for treatment of an addiction to prescription painkillers. His use of these drugs began after he experienced ongoing back pain related to the pratfalls he took during his Saturday Night Live appearances.[46] In 2010, he said that his drug abuse had been \"low level.\"[47] He entered Minnesota's Hazelden Clinic in September 2016 for treatment of an alcohol-related issue.[48]\nChase is an active environmentalist, charity fundraiser, and liberal. He raised money for Bill Clinton in the 1990s and John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential Election. Following the 2004 elections, Chase mocked President George W. Bush during a speech at a People for the American Way benefit at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, referring to the President as an \"uneducated, real lying schmuck\" and a \"dumb fuck.\"[49]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nGeorge Soros,[a] Hon FBA (born Schwartz Gy\u00f6rgy; August 12, 1930)[1][2] is a Hungarian-American[b] investor and philanthropist.[8][9] As of February\u00a02018[update], he had a net worth of $8 billion,[10] having donated more than $32 billion to his philanthropic agency, the Open Society Foundations.[11] Born in Budapest, Soros survived Nazi Germany-occupied Hungary and emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1947. He attended the London School of Economics, graduating with a bachelor's and eventually a master's degree in philosophy. Soros began his business career by taking various jobs at merchant banks in the United Kingdom and then the United States, before starting his first hedge fund, Double Eagle, in 1969. Profits from his first fund furnished the seed money to start Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed to Quantum Fund and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in assets under management, and as of 2011[update] it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.[12] Soros is known as \"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England\" because of his short sale of US$10 billion worth of pounds sterling, which made him a profit of $1\u00a0billion during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis.[13] Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated an application of Karl Popper's General Theory of Reflexivity to capital markets, which he claims renders a clear picture of asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.[14] Soros is a well-known supporter of progressive and liberal political causes, to which he dispenses donations through his foundation, the Open Society Foundations.[15] Between 1979 and 2011, he donated more than $11\u00a0billion to various philanthropic causes;[16][17] by 2017, his donations \"on civil initiatives to reduce poverty and increase transparency, and on scholarships and universities around the world\" totaled $12 billion.[18] He influenced the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s,[19] and provided one of Europe's largest higher education endowments to the Central European University in his Hungarian hometown.[20] His extensive funding of political causes has made him a \"bugaboo of European nationalists\".[21] Numerous American conservatives have promoted false claims that characterize Soros as a singularly dangerous \"puppet master\" behind a variety of alleged global plots, with The New York Times reporting that by 2018 these claims had \"moved from the fringes to the mainstream\" of Republican politics.[27] Conspiracy theories targeting Soros, who is of Jewish descent, have often been described as antisemitic.[28][29][30] Soros was born in Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots. Soros has wryly described his home as a Jewish antisemitic home.[31] His mother Erzs\u00e9bet (also known as Elizabeth) came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop. His father Tivadar (also known as Teodoro \u015cvarc) was a lawyer[32] and a well-known Esperanto-speaker[33] editing a literary magazine ('Literatura Mondo') who had also been a prisoner of war during and after World War I until he escaped from Russia and rejoined his family in Budapest.[34][35] The two married in 1924. In 1936, Soros's family changed their name from the German-Jewish Schwartz to Soros, as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic Hungary.[36][37] Tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning. In Hungarian, soros means \"next in line,\" or \"designated successor\"; in Esperanto it means \"will soar.\"[38][39][40] Soros was 13 years old in March 1944 when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary.[41] The Nazis barred Jewish children from attending school, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the Judenrat (\"Jewish Council\"), which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: \"The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper ... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, 'You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported'.\"[42][43] Soros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians. Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while inventorying a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family but also many other Hungarian Jews, and Soros later wrote that 1944 had been \"the happiest [year] of his life,\" for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.[44][45] In 1945, Soros survived the Siege of Budapest, in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city. In 1947, Soros immigrated to England and became a student at the London School of Economics.[46] While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter, and once received \u00a340 from a Quaker charity.[47] Soros would sometimes stand at Speakers' Corner lecturing about the virtues of internationalism in Esperanto, which he had learned from his father.[48] Soros took a Bachelor of Science in philosophy in 1951, and a Master of Science in philosophy in 1954, both from the London School of Economics.[49] In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, \"How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?\" Soros replied, \"Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank.\"[50] In 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank Singer & Friedlander of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.[51] In 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage trader for F. M. Mayer (1956\u201359). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the Coal and Steel Community, which later became the Common Market.[52] In 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to Wertheim & Co.. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy.[53] He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963. During this period, Soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of his tutor at the London School of Economics, Karl Popper. Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops. Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical \"virtuous\" or \"vicious\" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.[54][55] From 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the Interest Equalization Tax, which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966 he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies. In 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle hedge fund with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money.[56] It was based in Cura\u00e7ao, Dutch Antilles.[57] Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder's First Eagle fund established by Soros and that firm's chairman Henry H. Arnhold in 1967.[58] [59] In 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12\u00a0million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and Jim Rogers received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.[52] In 1970, Soros founded Soros Fund Management and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, Stanley Druckenmiller, Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.[60][61][62] In 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder. It was later renamed as the Quantum Fund, named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics. By that time the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.[51] By 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.[63] In July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1\u00a0billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5\u00a0billion family fortune, due to changes in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.[64] In 2013, the Quantum Fund made $5.5\u00a0billion, making it again the most successful hedge fund in history. Since its inception in 1973, the fund has generated $40\u00a0billion.[65] The fund announced in 2015 that it would inject $300 million to help finance the expansion of Fen Hotels, an Argentine hotel company. The funds will develop 5,000 rooms over the next three years throughout various Latin American countries.[66] Soros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling for months leading up to September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.[67] By September 16, 1992, the day of Black Wednesday, Soros's fund had sold short more than $10\u00a0billion in pounds,[60] profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries or float its currency. Finally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, devaluing the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1\u00a0billion.[68] He was dubbed \"the man who broke the Bank of England\".[69] The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the UK Treasury was \u00a33.4\u00a0billion.[70] Stanley Druckenmiller, who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: \"[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position.\"[71][72] On October 26, 1992, The New York Times quoted Soros as saying: \"Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10\u00a0billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15\u00a0billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell.\" Soros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas on February 5, 1996, in anticipation of selling them short. The markka had been put floating as a result of the early 1990s depression. The Bank of Finland and the Finnish Government commented at the time they believed that a \"conspiracy\" was impossible.[73] In 1997, during the Asian financial crisis, the prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad, accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for welcoming Myanmar as a member. Following on a history of antisemitic remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background (\"It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge\"[74]) and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis.[75] In 1998's The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered Soros explained his role in the crisis as follows: The financial crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity ... By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline\u2014we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)[76]In 1999, economist Paul Krugman was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets. [N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is 'Soroi'.[77]In an interview regarding the late-2000s recession, Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been \"some kind of an ideological excess.\" In Soros's view, the markets' moods\u2014a \"mood\" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at reality\u2014\"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles.\"[78] In reaction to the late-2000s recession, he founded the Institute for New Economic Thinking in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system. In 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges P\u00e9bereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac).[79] Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9. In 1989, the Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward.[80] However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006,[81] although it reduced the penalty to \u20ac940,000.[81] Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge[82] and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover.[81] In December 2006, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds, including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing.[83] On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal.[79] In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4\u20133 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.[84] Soros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war. Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by World War II.[85] They divorced in 1983. They had three children: In 1983, George Soros married Susan Weber. They divorced in 2005. They have two children: In 2008, Soros met Tamiko Bolton;[91] they married September 21, 2013.[92] Bolton is the daughter of a nurse and a retired naval commander, Robert Bolton. She was raised in California, earned an MBA from the University of Miami, and runs an Internet-based dietary supplement and vitamin-sales company.[93] Soros's older brother Paul Soros, a private investor and philanthropist, died on June 15, 2013.[94] Also an engineer, Paul headed Soros Associates and established the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for Young Americans.[95][96] He was married to Daisy Soros (n\u00e9e Schlenger), who, like her husband, was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant,[97] and with whom he had two sons, Peter and Jeffrey.[98] Peter Soros was married to the former Flora Fraser, a daughter of Lady Antonia Fraser and the late Sir Hugh Fraser and a stepdaughter of the late 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter. Fraser and Soros separated in 2009.[99] In 2005, Soros was a minority partner in a group that tried to buy the Washington Nationals, a Major League baseball team. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that they might move to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption if Soros bought the team.[100] In 2008, Soros's name was associated with AS Roma, an Italian association football team, but the club was not sold. Soros was a financial backer of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to Major League Soccer club D.C. United when the league was founded in 1995, but the group lost these rights in 2000.[101] On August 21, 2012, BBC reported SEC filings showing Soros acquired roughly a 1.9 percent stake in English football club Manchester United through the purchase of 3.1\u00a0million of the club's Class-A shares.[102] Soros had not been a large donor to U.S. political causes until the 2004 presidential election, but according to the Center for Responsive Politics, during the 2003\u20132004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 Groups (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 527). The groups aimed to defeat President George W. Bush. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called Democracy Alliance, which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.[103] In August 2009, Soros donated $35\u00a0million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140\u00a0million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the 2009 federal recovery act.[47] Soros was an initial donor to the Center for American Progress, and he continues to support the organization through the Open Society Foundations. In October 2011, a Reuters story, \"Soros: Not a funder of Wall Street Protests,\" was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined \"Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?\" with a lede stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement \"may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros].\" Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and Adbusters' co-founder Kalle Lasn both saying that Adbusters\u2014the reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protests\u2014had never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that \"indirect financial links\" existed between the two as late as 2010.[104][105] On September 27, 2012, Soros announced that he was donating $1\u00a0million to the super PAC backing President Barack Obama's reelection Priorities USA Action.[106] In October 2013, Soros donated $25,000 to Ready for Hillary, becoming a co-chairman of the super PAC's national finance committee.[107] In June 2015, he donated $1 million to the Super PAC Priorities USA Action, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. He donated $6 million to the PAC in December 2015 and $2.5 million in August 2016.[108] According to Waldemar A. Nielsen, an authority on American philanthropy,[109] \"[Soros] has undertaken ... nothing less than to open up the once-closed communist societies of Eastern Europe to a free flow of ideas and scientific knowledge from the outside world.\"[110] From 1979, as an advocate of 'open societies', Soros financially supported dissidents including Poland's Solidarity movement, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union.[111] In 1984, he founded his first Open Society Institute in Hungary with a budget of $3\u00a0million.[112] Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros' funding has played an important role in the former Soviet sphere. A 2017 study found that a grant program by George Soros which awarded funding to over 28,000 scientists in the former Soviet sphere shortly after the end of the Soviet Union \"more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting [beneficial] impacts.\"[113] His funding of pro-democratic programs in Georgia was considered by Georgian nationalists to be crucial to the success of the Rose Revolution, although Soros has said that his role has been \"greatly exaggerated.\"[114] Alexander Lomaia, Secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, is a former Executive Director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2.5\u00a0million.[115] Former Georgian foreign minister Salom\u00e9 Zourabichvili wrote that institutions like the Soros Foundation were the cradle of democratization and that all the NGOs that gravitated around the Soros Foundation undeniably carried the revolution. She opines that after the revolution the Soros Foundation and the NGOs were integrated into power.[116] Some Soros-backed pro-democracy initiatives have been banned in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.[117] Ercis Kurtulus, head of the Social Transparency Movement Association (TSHD) in Turkey, said in an interview that \"Soros carried out his will in Ukraine and Georgia by using these NGOs ... Last year Russia passed a special law prohibiting NGOs from taking money from foreigners. I think this should be banned in Turkey as well.\"[118] In 1997, Soros closed his foundation in Belarus after it was fined $3\u00a0million by the government for \"tax and currency violations.\" According to The New York Times, the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West and in Russia for his efforts to control the Belarus Soros Foundation and other independent NGOs and to suppress civil and human rights. Soros called the fines part of a campaign to \"destroy independent society.\"[119] In June 2009, Soros donated $100\u00a0million to Central Europe and Eastern Europe to counter the impact of the economic crisis on the poor, voluntary groups and non-government organisations.[120] Since 2012 the Hungarian Fidesz government labelled George Soros as enemy of the state due to his humanitarian and political involvement in the European refugee crisis. The government has attacked OSF, the international civil support foundation created by George Soros, and tried to revoke the licence of Central European University (Budapest) (which failed mostly due to significant public outrage[121]). In response Soros called the government \"a mafia state\".[122] As the 2018 election period started the government introduced public posters with the photo of Soros,[123] to create hostility in the general public towards him, using statements such as \"Soros wants millions of migrants to live in Hungary\", and \"Soros wants to dismantle the border fence\". The government also prepared a three-part law plan called \"Stop Soros package\" (which followed other various law changes[124] in the same year which hindered workings of several international NGOs in Hungary), which would include various steps against NGOs doing volunteer work related to the refugee crisis. In March 2017, six US senators sent a letter to then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson[125] asking that he look into several grants the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have given to groups funded by \"left-wing\" Soros. According to the Heritage Foundation, the letter expressed specific concern about Soros' influence on Macedonian politics, a concern which has also been expressed by members of the conservative Macedonian government.[126] In the same context, the conservative group Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State and USAID compelling them to release records regarding $5 million transferred from USAID to Soros' Open Society branch in Macedonia. The suit alleges that the money was deliberately used to destabilize the Macedonian government,[127] where the Open Society Foundation claims its activities were aimed at ethnic reconciliation.[128] In January 2017, the \"Stop Operation Soros\" (SOS) initiative was launched in Macedonia. SOS seeks to present \"questions and answers about the way Soros operates worldwide\" and invites citizens to contribute to the research. In a press conference held during the same month, Nenad Mircevski, one of the founders of the initiative, stated that SOS would work towards the \"de-Soros-ization\" of Macedonia.[129][130] On May 16, 2018, Soros' Open Society Foundations announced they would move its office from Budapest to Berlin, blaming the move on an \"increasingly repressive\" environment in Hungary.[131][132][133] The Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa is a Soros-affiliated organization.[134] In November 2005, Soros said: \"My personal opinion is there's no alternative but to give Kosovo independence.\"[135] Soros has helped fund the non-profit group called Independent Diplomat.[136] It represented Kosovo, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (under military occupation by Turkey since 1974),[137] Somaliland and the Polisario Front of Western Sahara.[136] Soros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28g) of marijuana in the state. Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine.[138] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation.[139] Soros donated $1.4\u00a0million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.[140] In October 2010, Soros donated $1\u00a0million to support California's Proposition 19.[141] According to remarks in an interview in October 2009, it is Soros' opinion that marijuana is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students. He himself has not used marijuana for years.[142] Soros has been a major financier of the Drug Policy Alliance \u2013 an organization that promotes cannabis legalization \u2013 with roughly $4\u00a0million in annual contributions from one of his foundations.[143] The Project on Death in America, active from 1994 to 2003,[144] was one of the Open Society Institute's projects, which sought to \"understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement.\"[145] In 1994, Soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother, a member of the right-to-die advocacy organization Hemlock Society, commit suicide.[146] In the same speech, he also endorsed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act,[147] proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign.[148] Soros' philanthropy and support for progressive causes has made him the object of a large number of conspiracy theories, most of them originating from the political right.[149][150] Veronika Bondarenko, writing for Business Insider said that \"For two decades, some have seen Soros as a kind of puppet master secretly controlling the global economy and politics.\"[151] The New York Times describes the allegations as moving \"from the dark corners of the internet and talk radio\" to \"the very center of the political debate\" by 2018.[152] Soros has become a magnet for such theories, with opponents claiming that he is behind such diverse events as the 2017 Women's March, the fact-checking website Snopes, the gun-control activism engaged in by the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,[153][154][155] the October 2018 immigrant caravans, and the protests against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.[152][156] Conservatives, meanwhile, picked up on the thread in the late 2000s, spearheaded by Fox News. Bill O'Reilly gave an almost ten-minute monologue on Soros in 2007, calling him an \"extremist\" and claiming he was \"off-the-charts dangerous\".[154] Breitbart News, according to the London Times journalist, David Aaronovitch, in promoting East European nationalism, has regularly published articles blaming Soros for anything of which it disapproves.[157] Soros' opposition to Brexit (in the United Kingdom) led to a front page on the British Conservative supporting newspaper, The Daily Telegraph in February 2018, which was accused of antisemitism for claiming he was involved in a supposed \"secret plot\" for the country's voters to reverse their decision to leave the European Union.[28] While the Telegraph did not mention Soros is Jewish, his opposition to Britain leaving the European Union had been reported elsewhere in less conspiratorial terms.[29] Stephen Pollard, editor of The Jewish Chronicle, said on Twitter: \"The point is that language matters so much and this is exactly the language being used by antisemites here and abroad\".[30][158] In October 2019, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Soros of being the \"funder-in-chief\" of the Remain campaign, and was subsequently accused of anti-Semitism by opposition MPs.[159] After being ousted from office in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal of 2016, Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson accused Soros of having bankrolled a conspiracy to remove him from power.[160][161] It was later pointed out that Soros himself had also been implicated in the Panama Papers, casting doubt on the prime minister's theory.[162] Right-wing figures such as Alex Jones, Donald Trump Jr., James Woods, Dinesh D'Souza, Louie Gohmert, and Larry Klayman have spread a false conspiracy theory, which has been described as anti-Semitic, that Soros was a Nazi collaborator who turned in other Jews and stole their property.[163][164][165][166] Soros was a child during World War II who had to hide from the Hungarian government during Nazi occupation.[173] In October 2018, Soros was accused of funding a Central American migrant caravan heading toward America.[174][175][176] The theory that Soros was somehow causing Central American migration at the southern US border apparently dates back to late March 2018, however.[177] The October 2018 strain of the theory has been described to combine anti-semitism, anti-immigrant sentiment and \"the specter of powerful foreign agents controlling major world events in pursuit of a hidden agenda\", connecting Soros and other wealthy individuals of Jewish faith or background to the October caravan.[177] Both Cesar Sayoc, the perpetrator of the October 2018 attempted bombings of prominent Democrats, and Robert Bowers, the perpetrator of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, referred to this conspiracy theory on social media before their crimes.[178][179] In November 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan denounced Soros while speaking about Turkey's political purges, saying: \"The person who financed terrorists during the Gezi incidents is already in prison. And who is behind him? The famous Hungarian Jew Soros. This is a man who assigns people to divide nations and shatter them.\"[180] In November 2019, attorney Joseph diGenova, who is known for promoting conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice and the FBI,[189] asserted without evidence that Soros \"controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department\" and \"also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NGOs -- work with NGOs. That was very evident in Ukraine.\"[190] A pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros's Katonah, New York home on October 22, 2018, as part of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts. The package was discovered by a caretaker,[191] who removed it and notified authorities. It was photographed and exploded by the FBI, which launched an investigation.[192][193] For several days afterward, similar bombs were mailed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and several other Democrats and liberals.[194] On October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc was arrested in Aventura, Florida, on suspicion of mailing the bombs.[195] Soros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations. Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.[55] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:[55] A recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.[55] Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses. Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans \u2013 the value of the houses \u2013 had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively). Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still. This was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards. The concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,[196] but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology.[197] The notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of Complexity economics, as developed at the Santa Fe Institute, although Soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.[198][199][200][201] Although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"Open Society\" in the past were from Communism and Fascism (as discussed in The Open Society and Its Enemies by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism. He has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.[202] Soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism.[203] Soros's book The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a \"superbubble\" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states: I have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in The Alchemy of Finance (in 1987), then in The Crisis of Global Capitalism (in 1998), and now in this book. So it's three books predicting disaster. [After] the boy cried wolf three times ... the wolf really came.[204] He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong. I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.[204] In February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.[205] \"We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom.\" In January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a financial crisis akin to 2008 based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking Chinese yuan. China has a major adjustment problem. I would say it amounts to a crisis. When I look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in 2008.[206][207] When asked about what he thought about Israel, in The New Yorker, Soros replied: \"I don't deny the Jews to a right to a national existence \u2013 but I don't want anything to do with it.\"[208] According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of \"challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies\" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy.[209] He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies[210][211][212] including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.[210] Speaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of George W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism. Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the \"Jewish financiers\" who, in antisemitic terms, \"ruled the world by proxy\", suggested that if we change the direction of those policies, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of what's out there, and \"blamed the victim\" when holding Jews responsible for antisemitism. Jewish philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified, \"George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be.\"[213] Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by \"giv[ing] up on the tribalness\".[214] In a subsequent article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized that I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.[215]In 2017, Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz filed a $10 million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the government of Guinea to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to \"long-standing animus toward the state of Israel\".[216][217][218] Steinmetz claims that Soros engaged in a \"smear\" campaign against him and his companies and blames Soros for scrutiny of him by American, Israeli, Swiss, and Guinean authorities.[219] Soros called Steinmetz's suit \"frivolous and entirely false\" and said that it was \"a desperate PR stunt meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions\".[220] During an award ceremony for Imre Kert\u00e9sz, Soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming \"perpetrators of violence\", suggesting that this model explained Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians, which led to walkouts and Soros being booed.[221] In July 2017, in Hungary a billboard campaign backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n which was considered to be anti-semitic by the country's Jewish groups vilified Soros as an enemy of the state using the slogan \"Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh\".[222] The campaign was estimated to have cost 5.7bn forints (then US$21 million).[223] According to the Israeli ambassador the campaign \"evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear\", a reference to Hungary's role in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust.[224] Lydia Gall of Human Rights Watch asserted that it was reminiscent of Nazi posters during the Second World War featuring \"'the laughing Jew'\".[225] Orb\u00e1n and his government's representative said they had a \"zero tolerance\" of antisemitism explaining the posters were aiming to persuade voters Soros was a \"national security risk\".[222] Hours later, in an apparent attempt to ally Israel with Hungary, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a \"clarification\", denouncing Soros, stating that he \"continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself\".[226] Soros' son Alexander said in an interview that his father cares about Israel, and that he \"would like to see Israel in Yitzhak Rabin's image. His views are more or less the common views in Meretz and in the Labor Party.\" According to Alexander, Soros supports a two-state solution. The younger Soros recounts that after his bar mitzvah in 1998, his father told him: \"If you're serious about being Jewish, you might want to consider immigrating to Israel.\"[227] On November 11, 2003, in an interview with The Washington Post, Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the \"central focus of my life\" and \"a matter of life and death\". He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush \"if someone guaranteed it\".[228][229] Soros gave $3\u00a0million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5\u00a0million to MoveOn.org, and $20\u00a0million[230] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech: Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush[231] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The online transcript to this speech received many hits after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as \"factcheck.com\" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site.[232] His 2003 book, The Bubble of American Supremacy[233], was a forthright critique of the Bush administration's \"War on Terror\" as misconceived and counterproductive, and a polemic against the re-election of Bush. He explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the self-reinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices. When Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in The Age of Fallibility that \"the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States\", he responded that \"it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world ... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims.\"[234] Soros described Donald Trump as a con man.[235] Soros expects Trump to fail because Soros believes Trump's ideas are self-contradictory. Soros said in 2017 he believed Trump was preparing for a trade war and expected financial markets to do badly.[236] In October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled \"As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite\",[237] in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis. The letter was co-signed by Javier Solana, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Andrew Duff, Emma Bonino, Massimo D'Alema, Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga. Soros criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his handling of the European migrant crisis in 2015: \"His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.\"[238] Soros expected that Brexit would fail and the Premiership of Theresa May would last only a short time.[236] Soros is opposed to Brexit and donated \u00a3400,000 to the anti-Brexit 'Best for Britain' group.[239] Soros also hosted a dinner for Conservative donors at his London home to encourage them to follow his lead. Soros's Open Society Foundations also donated a total of \u00a3303,000 to two pro-EU organizations, the European Movement UK and Scientists for EU, and a center-right think-tank, Bright Blue.[240] In 2018, Soros highlighted that Europe faces major challenges, in particular, that related to immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the political block.[241] He holds that Europe is facing an existential crisis, in view of the rise of populism, the refugee crisis and a growing rift between Europe and the United States.[242] Soros has also stated that \"the euro has many unresolved problems\" which \"must not be allowed to destroy the European Union\". He advocated replacing the notion of a multi-speed Europe by the aim of a \"multi-track Europe\" that would allow member states a wider variety of choices.[243] In view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a Marshall Plan for Africa (see Marshall Plan), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration.[241][243] Soros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, \"China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests ... They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well.\" Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, \"Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States.\"[244] In July 2015, Soros stated that a \"strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict\".[245] In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that \"[a] hard landing is practically unavoidable\". Chinese state media responded by stating \"Soros' challenge to the RMB and Hong Kong dollar are doomed to fail, without any doubt.\"[246] In January 2019, Soros used his annual speech at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, to label Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of China, as the \"most dangerous opponent of open societies\", saying: \"China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced\". He also urged the United States not to allow the Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE to dominate the 5G telecommunications market as this would present an \"unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world\".[247][248] Soros also criticized the newest form of China's Big Brother-like system of mass surveillance called the Social Credit System, saying it would give Xi, \"total control\" over the people of China.\"[249] In May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: \"I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now.\"[250] In January 2015, Soros said that \"Europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from Russia.\" He also urged Western countries to expand economic sanctions against Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.[251] In January 2015, Soros called on the European Union to give $50\u00a0billion of bailout money to Ukraine.[252] In July 2015, Soros stated that Putin's annexation of Crimea was a challenge to the \"prevailing world order,\" specifically the European Union. He hypothesized that Putin wants to \"destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support.\"[245] In November 2015, Russia banned the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI)-- two pro-democracy charities founded by Soros\u2014stating they posed a \"threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state.\"[253][254] In January 2016, 53 books related to Soros's \"Renewal of Humanitarian Education\" program were withdrawn at the Vorkuta Mining and Economic College in the Komi Republic, with 427 additional books seized for shredding. A Russian intergovernmental letter released in December 2015 stated that Soros's charities were \"forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives, alien to Russian ideology, popular\". Most of these books were published with funds donated by Soros's charities.[255][256] As of February\u00a02017[update], Forbes magazine listed Soros as the 29th richest person in the world,[257] the world's richest hedge-fund manager, and 19th on its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans,[258] with a net worth estimated at $25.2\u00a0billion.[259] This was after Soros had lost almost $1 billion in the weeks after the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president in 2016.[260] Soros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa,[111] and began funding dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain. Soros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent democratization in the post-Soviet states. These efforts, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the Open Society Foundations (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland). As of 2003, PBS estimated that he had given away a total of $4\u00a0billion.[82] The OSI says it has spent about $500\u00a0million annually in recent years. In 2003, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker wrote in the foreword of Soros's book The Alchemy of Finance: George Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game. The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become \"open societies\", open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but\u2014more important\u2014tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.[261]Time magazine in 2007 cited two specific projects\u2014$100\u00a0million toward Internet infrastructure for regional Russian universities, and $50\u00a0million for the Millennium Promise to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa\u2014noting that Soros had given $742\u00a0million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7\u00a0billion.[262] Other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, and Transparency International. Soros also pledged an endowment of \u20ac420\u00a0million to the Central European University (CEU). According to National Review Online[263] the Open Society Institute gave $20,000 in September 2002 to the Defense Committee of Lynne Stewart, the lawyer who has defended controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to 21/3 years in prison for \"providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy\" via a press conference for a client. An OSI spokeswoman said \"it appeared to us at that time that there was a right-to-counsel issue worthy of our support\" but claimed later requests for support were declined.[264] In September 2006, Soros pledged $50\u00a0million to the Millennium Promise, led by economist Jeffrey Sachs to provide educational, agricultural, and medical aid to help villages in Africa enduring poverty. The New York Times termed this endeavor a \"departure\" for Soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government, but Soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance.[265] Soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in Hungary (1984\u201389)[19] and provided a substantial endowment to Central European University in Budapest.[266] The Open Society Foundations has active programs in more than 60 countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately $600\u00a0million a year.[3][267] On October 17, 2017, it was announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion to the Open Society Foundations.[268] In October 2018, Soros donated $2 million to the Wikimedia Foundation via the Wikimedia Endowment program.[269] Soros received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social Research (New York), the University of Oxford in 1980, the Corvinus University of Budapest, and Yale University in 1991. He received an honorary degree in economics from the University of Bologna in 1995.[270] In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A. Cohen.[271] In January 2014, Soros was ranked number 1 in LCH Investments list of top 20 managers having posting gains of almost $42 billion since the launch of his Quantum Endowment Fund in 1973.[272] In July 2017, Soros was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.[273] Soros was the Financial Times Person of the Year for 2018, with the FT describing him as \"a standard bearer for liberal democracy, an idea under siege from populists\".[274] In April 2019 Soros was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Courage.[275] In his acceptance address Soros said: \"In my native Hungary, the government of [Prime Minister] Viktor Orb\u00e1n has turned me into the super villain of an alleged plot to destroy the supposed Christian identity of the Hungarian nation... [I] donate the prize money associated with this award to the Hungarian Spectrum, an online English-language publication that provides daily updates on Hungarian politics. It renders an important service by exposing to the world [in English] what Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is telling his own people [in Hungarian]. It [Hungarian Spectrum] deserves to be better known and supported.\"[276] George Soros has written many books, articles, and papers on economics, finance, stock trading, and geopolitics.",

He attended the London School of Economics, graduating with a bachelor's and eventually a master's degree in philosophy. Soros began his business career by taking various jobs at merchant banks in the United Kingdom and then the United States, before starting his first hedge fund, Double Eagle, in 1969. Profits from his first fund furnished the seed money to start Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed to Quantum Fund and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in assets under management, and as of 2011[update] it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.[12]\nSoros is known as \"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England\" because of his short sale of US$10 billion worth of pounds sterling, which made him a profit of $1\u00a0billion during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis.[13] Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated an application of Karl Popper's General Theory of Reflexivity to capital markets, which he claims renders a clear picture of asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.[14]\nSoros is a well-known supporter of progressive and liberal political causes, to which he dispenses donations through his foundation, the Open Society Foundations.[15] Between 1979 and 2011, he donated more than $11\u00a0billion to various philanthropic causes;[16][17] by 2017, his donations \"on civil initiatives to reduce poverty and increase transparency, and on scholarships and universities around the world\" totaled $12 billion.[18] He influenced the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s,[19] and provided one of Europe's largest higher education endowments to the Central European University in his Hungarian hometown.[20] His extensive funding of political causes has made him a \"bugaboo of European nationalists\".[21] Numerous American conservatives have promoted false claims that characterize Soros as a singularly dangerous \"puppet master\" behind a variety of alleged global plots, with The New York Times reporting that by 2018 these claims had \"moved from the fringes to the mainstream\" of Republican politics.[27] Conspiracy theories targeting Soros, who is of Jewish descent, have often been described as antisemitic.[28][29][30]\nSoros was born in Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots. Soros has wryly described his home as a Jewish antisemitic home.[31] His mother Erzs\u00e9bet (also known as Elizabeth) came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop. His father Tivadar (also known as Teodoro \u015cvarc) was a lawyer[32] and a well-known Esperanto-speaker[33] editing a literary magazine ('Literatura Mondo') who had also been a prisoner of war during and after World War I until he escaped from Russia and rejoined his family in Budapest.[34][35] The two married in 1924. In 1936, Soros's family changed their name from the German-Jewish Schwartz to Soros, as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic Hungary.[36][37] Tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning. In Hungarian, soros means \"next in line,\" or \"designated successor\"; in Esperanto it means \"will soar.\"[38][39][40]\nSoros was 13 years old in March 1944 when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary.[41] The Nazis barred Jewish children from attending school, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the Judenrat (\"Jewish Council\"), which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: \"The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper ...  I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, 'You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported'.\"[42][43]\nSoros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians. Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while inventorying a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family but also many other Hungarian Jews, and Soros later wrote that 1944 had been \"the happiest [year] of his life,\" for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.[44][45] In 1945, Soros survived the Siege of Budapest, in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city.\nIn 1947, Soros immigrated to England and became a student at the London School of Economics.[46] While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter, and once received \u00a340 from a Quaker charity.[47] Soros would sometimes stand at Speakers' Corner lecturing about the virtues of internationalism in Esperanto, which he had learned from his father.[48]\nSoros took a Bachelor of Science in philosophy in 1951, and a Master of Science in philosophy in 1954, both from the London School of Economics.[49]\nIn a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, \"How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?\" Soros replied, \"Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank.\"[50]\nIn 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.[51]\nIn 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage trader for F. M. Mayer (1956\u201359). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the Coal and Steel Community, which later became the Common Market.[52]\nIn 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to Wertheim &amp; Co.. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy.[53] He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963.\nDuring this period, Soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of his tutor at the London School of Economics, Karl Popper. Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops.  Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical \"virtuous\" or \"vicious\" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.[54][55]\nFrom 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the Interest Equalization Tax, which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966 he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies.\nIn 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle hedge fund with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money.[56] It was based in Cura\u00e7ao, Dutch Antilles.[57] Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder's First Eagle fund established by Soros and that firm's chairman Henry H. Arnhold in 1967.[58]\n[59]\nIn 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12\u00a0million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and Jim Rogers received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.[52]\nIn 1970, Soros founded Soros Fund Management and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, Stanley Druckenmiller, Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.[60][61][62]\nIn 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder.\nIt was later renamed as the Quantum Fund, named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics. By that time the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.[51]\nBy 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.[63]\nIn July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1\u00a0billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5\u00a0billion family fortune, due to changes in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.[64]\nIn 2013, the Quantum Fund made $5.5\u00a0billion, making it again the most successful hedge fund in history. Since its inception in 1973, the fund has generated $40\u00a0billion.[65]\nThe fund announced in 2015 that it would inject $300 million to help finance the expansion of Fen Hotels, an Argentine hotel company. The funds will develop 5,000 rooms over the next three years throughout various Latin American countries.[66]\nSoros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling for months leading up to September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.[67]\nBy September 16, 1992, the day of Black Wednesday, Soros's fund had sold short more than $10\u00a0billion in pounds,[60] profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries or float its currency.\nFinally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, devaluing the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1\u00a0billion.[68] He was dubbed \"the man who broke the Bank of England\".[69] The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the UK Treasury was \u00a33.4\u00a0billion.[70] Stanley Druckenmiller, who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: \"[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position.\"[71][72]\nOn October 26, 1992, The New York Times quoted Soros as saying: \"Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10\u00a0billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15\u00a0billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell.\"\nSoros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas on February 5, 1996, in anticipation of selling them short. The markka had been put floating as a result of the early 1990s depression. The Bank of Finland and the Finnish Government commented at the time they believed that a \"conspiracy\" was impossible.[73]\nIn 1997, during the Asian financial crisis, the prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad, accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for welcoming Myanmar as a member. Following on a history of antisemitic remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background (\"It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge\"[74]) and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis.[75] In 1998's The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered Soros explained his role in the crisis as follows:\nThe financial crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity ... By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline\u2014we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)[76]In 1999, economist Paul Krugman was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets.\n[N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is 'Soroi'.[77]In an interview regarding the late-2000s recession, Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been \"some kind of an ideological excess.\" In Soros's view, the markets' moods\u2014a \"mood\" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at reality\u2014\"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles.\"[78]\nIn reaction to the late-2000s recession, he founded the Institute for New Economic Thinking in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system.\nIn 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges P\u00e9bereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac).[79] Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9.\nIn 1989, the Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward.[80] However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006,[81] although it reduced the penalty to \u20ac940,000.[81]\nSoros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge[82] and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover.[81] In December 2006, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds, including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing.[83] On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal.[79] In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4\u20133 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.[84]\nSoros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war. Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by World War II.[85] They divorced in 1983. They had three children:\nIn 1983, George Soros married Susan Weber. They divorced in 2005. They have two children:\nIn 2008, Soros met Tamiko Bolton;[91] they married September 21, 2013.[92] Bolton is the daughter of a nurse and a retired naval commander, Robert Bolton. She was raised in California, earned an MBA from the University of Miami, and runs an Internet-based dietary supplement and vitamin-sales company.[93]\nSoros's older brother Paul Soros, a private investor and philanthropist, died on June 15, 2013.[94] Also an engineer, Paul headed Soros Associates and established the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for Young Americans.[95][96] He was married to Daisy Soros (n\u00e9e Schlenger), who, like her husband, was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant,[97] and with whom he had two sons, Peter and Jeffrey.[98] Peter Soros was married to the former Flora Fraser, a daughter of Lady Antonia Fraser and the late Sir Hugh Fraser and a stepdaughter of the late 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter. Fraser and Soros separated in 2009.[99]\nIn 2005, Soros was a minority partner in a group that tried to buy the Washington Nationals, a Major League baseball team. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that they might move to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption if Soros bought the team.[100] In 2008, Soros's name was associated with AS Roma, an Italian association football team, but the club was not sold. Soros was a financial backer of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to Major League Soccer club D.C. United when the league was founded in 1995, but the group lost these rights in 2000.[101] On August 21, 2012, BBC reported SEC filings showing Soros acquired roughly a 1.9 percent stake in English football club Manchester United through the purchase of 3.1\u00a0million of the club's Class-A shares.[102]\nSoros had not been a large donor to U.S. political causes until the 2004 presidential election, but according to the Center for Responsive Politics, during the 2003\u20132004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 Groups (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 527). The groups aimed to defeat President George W. Bush. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called Democracy Alliance, which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.[103]\nIn August 2009, Soros donated $35\u00a0million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140\u00a0million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the 2009 federal recovery act.[47]\nSoros was an initial donor to the Center for American Progress, and he continues to support the organization through the Open Society Foundations.\nIn October 2011, a Reuters story, \"Soros: Not a funder of Wall Street Protests,\" was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined \"Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?\" with a lede stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement \"may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros].\" Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and Adbusters' co-founder Kalle Lasn both saying that Adbusters\u2014the reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protests\u2014had never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that \"indirect financial links\" existed between the two as late as 2010.[104][105]\nOn September 27, 2012, Soros announced that he was donating $1\u00a0million to the super PAC backing President Barack Obama's reelection Priorities USA Action.[106]\nIn October 2013, Soros donated $25,000 to Ready for Hillary, becoming a co-chairman of the super PAC's national finance committee.[107] In June 2015, he donated $1 million to the Super PAC Priorities USA Action, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. He donated $6 million to the PAC in December 2015 and $2.5 million in August 2016.[108]\nAccording to Waldemar A. Nielsen, an authority on American philanthropy,[109] \"[Soros] has undertaken ... nothing less than to open up the once-closed communist societies of Eastern Europe to a free flow of ideas and scientific knowledge from the outside world.\"[110] From 1979, as an advocate of 'open societies', Soros financially supported dissidents including Poland's Solidarity movement, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union.[111] In 1984, he founded his first Open Society Institute in Hungary with a budget of $3\u00a0million.[112]\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros' funding has played an important role in the former Soviet sphere. A 2017 study found that a grant program by George Soros which awarded funding to over 28,000 scientists in the former Soviet sphere shortly after the end of the Soviet Union \"more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting [beneficial] impacts.\"[113] His funding of pro-democratic programs in Georgia was considered by Georgian nationalists to be crucial to the success of the Rose Revolution, although Soros has said that his role has been \"greatly exaggerated.\"[114] Alexander Lomaia, Secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, is a former Executive Director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2.5\u00a0million.[115]\nFormer Georgian foreign minister Salom\u00e9 Zourabichvili wrote that institutions like the Soros Foundation were the cradle of democratization and that all the NGOs that gravitated around the Soros Foundation undeniably carried the revolution. She opines that after the revolution the Soros Foundation and the NGOs were integrated into power.[116]\nSome Soros-backed pro-democracy initiatives have been banned in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.[117] Ercis Kurtulus, head of the Social Transparency Movement Association (TSHD) in Turkey, said in an interview that  \"Soros carried out his will in Ukraine and Georgia by using these NGOs ... Last year Russia passed a special law prohibiting NGOs from taking money from foreigners. I think this should be banned in Turkey as well.\"[118] In 1997, Soros closed his foundation in Belarus after it was fined $3\u00a0million by the government for \"tax and currency violations.\" According to The New York Times, the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West and in Russia for his efforts to control the Belarus Soros Foundation and other independent NGOs and to suppress civil and human rights. Soros called the fines part of a campaign to \"destroy independent society.\"[119]\nIn June 2009, Soros donated $100\u00a0million to Central Europe and Eastern Europe to counter the impact of the economic crisis on the poor, voluntary groups and non-government organisations.[120]\nSince 2012 the Hungarian Fidesz government labelled George Soros as enemy of the state due to his humanitarian and political involvement in the European refugee crisis. The government has attacked OSF, the international civil support foundation created by George Soros, and tried to revoke the licence of Central European University (Budapest) (which failed mostly due to significant public outrage[121]). In response Soros called the government \"a mafia state\".[122]\nAs the 2018 election period started the government introduced public posters with the photo of Soros,[123] to create hostility in the general public towards him, using statements such as \"Soros wants millions of migrants to live in Hungary\", and \"Soros wants to dismantle the border fence\". The government also prepared a three-part law plan called \"Stop Soros package\" (which followed other various law changes[124] in the same year which hindered workings of several international NGOs in Hungary), which would include various steps against NGOs doing volunteer work related to the refugee crisis.\nIn March 2017, six US senators sent a letter to then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson[125] asking that he look into several grants the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have given to groups funded by \"left-wing\" Soros. According to the Heritage Foundation, the letter expressed specific concern about Soros' influence on Macedonian politics, a concern which has also been expressed by members of the conservative Macedonian government.[126] In the same context, the conservative group Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State and USAID compelling them to release records regarding $5 million transferred from USAID to Soros' Open Society branch in Macedonia. The suit alleges that the money was deliberately used to destabilize the Macedonian government,[127] where the Open Society Foundation claims its activities were aimed at ethnic reconciliation.[128]\nIn January 2017, the \"Stop Operation Soros\" (SOS) initiative was launched in Macedonia. SOS seeks to present \"questions and answers about the way Soros operates worldwide\" and invites citizens to contribute to the research. In a press conference held during the same month, Nenad Mircevski, one of the founders of the initiative, stated that SOS would work towards the \"de-Soros-ization\" of Macedonia.[129][130]\nOn May 16, 2018, Soros' Open Society Foundations announced they would move its office from Budapest to Berlin, blaming the move on an \"increasingly repressive\" environment in Hungary.[131][132][133]\nThe Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa is a Soros-affiliated organization.[134]\nIn November 2005, Soros said: \"My personal opinion is there's no alternative but to give Kosovo independence.\"[135] Soros has helped fund the non-profit group called Independent Diplomat.[136] It represented Kosovo, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (under military occupation by Turkey since 1974),[137] Somaliland and the Polisario Front of Western Sahara.[136]\nSoros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28g) of marijuana in the state.  Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine.[138] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation.[139] Soros donated $1.4\u00a0million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.[140]\nIn October 2010, Soros donated $1\u00a0million to support California's Proposition 19.[141]\nAccording to remarks in an interview in October 2009, it is Soros' opinion that marijuana is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students. He himself has not used marijuana for years.[142] Soros has been a major financier of the Drug Policy Alliance \u2013 an organization that promotes cannabis legalization \u2013 with roughly $4\u00a0million in annual contributions from one of his foundations.[143]\nThe Project on Death in America, active from 1994 to 2003,[144] was one of the Open Society Institute's projects, which sought to \"understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement.\"[145] In 1994, Soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother, a member of the right-to-die advocacy organization Hemlock Society, commit suicide.[146] In the same speech, he also endorsed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act,[147] proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign.[148]\n\nSoros' philanthropy and support for progressive causes has made him the object of a large number of conspiracy theories, most of them originating from the political right.[149][150] Veronika Bondarenko, writing for Business Insider said that \"For two decades, some have seen Soros as a kind of puppet master secretly controlling the global economy and politics.\"[151] The New York Times describes the allegations as moving \"from the dark corners of the internet and talk radio\" to \"the very center of the political debate\" by 2018.[152]\nSoros has become a magnet for such theories, with opponents claiming that he is behind such diverse events as the 2017 Women's March, the fact-checking website Snopes, the gun-control activism engaged in by the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,[153][154][155] the October 2018 immigrant caravans, and the protests against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.[152][156]\nConservatives, meanwhile, picked up on the thread in the late 2000s, spearheaded by Fox News. Bill O'Reilly gave an almost ten-minute monologue on Soros in 2007, calling him an \"extremist\" and claiming he was \"off-the-charts dangerous\".[154] Breitbart News, according to the London Times journalist, David Aaronovitch, in promoting East European nationalism, has regularly published articles blaming Soros for anything of which it disapproves.[157]\nSoros' opposition to Brexit (in the United Kingdom) led to a front page on the British Conservative supporting newspaper, The Daily Telegraph in February 2018, which was accused of antisemitism for claiming he was involved in a supposed \"secret plot\" for the country's voters to reverse their decision to leave the European Union.[28] While the Telegraph did not mention Soros is Jewish, his opposition to Britain leaving the European Union had been reported elsewhere in less conspiratorial terms.[29] Stephen Pollard, editor of The Jewish Chronicle, said on Twitter: \"The point is that language matters so much and this is exactly the language being used by antisemites here and abroad\".[30][158] In October 2019, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Soros of being the \"funder-in-chief\" of the Remain campaign, and was subsequently accused of anti-Semitism by opposition MPs.[159]\nAfter being ousted from office in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal of 2016, Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson accused Soros of having bankrolled a conspiracy to remove him from power.[160][161] It was later pointed out that Soros himself had also been implicated in the Panama Papers, casting doubt on the prime minister's theory.[162]\nRight-wing figures such as Alex Jones, Donald Trump Jr., James Woods, Dinesh D'Souza, Louie Gohmert, and Larry Klayman have spread a false conspiracy theory, which has been described as anti-Semitic, that Soros was a Nazi collaborator who turned in other Jews and stole their property.[163][164][165][166] Soros was a child during World War II who had to hide from the Hungarian government during Nazi occupation.[173]\nIn October 2018, Soros was accused of funding a Central American migrant caravan heading toward America.[174][175][176] The theory that Soros was somehow causing Central American migration at the southern US border apparently dates back to late March 2018, however.[177] The October 2018 strain of the theory has been described to combine anti-semitism, anti-immigrant sentiment and \"the specter of powerful foreign agents controlling major world events in pursuit of a hidden agenda\", connecting Soros and other wealthy individuals of Jewish faith or background to the October caravan.[177] Both Cesar Sayoc, the perpetrator of the October 2018 attempted bombings of prominent Democrats, and Robert Bowers, the perpetrator of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, referred to this conspiracy theory on social media before their crimes.[178][179]\nIn November 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan denounced Soros while speaking about Turkey's political purges, saying: \"The person who financed terrorists during the Gezi incidents is already in prison. And who is behind him? The famous Hungarian Jew Soros. This is a man who assigns people to divide nations and shatter them.\"[180]\nIn November 2019, attorney Joseph diGenova, who is known for promoting conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice and the FBI,[189] asserted without evidence that Soros \"controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department\" and \"also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NGOs -- work with NGOs. That was very evident in Ukraine.\"[190]\nA pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros's Katonah, New York home on October 22, 2018, as part of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts. The package was discovered by a caretaker,[191] who removed it and notified authorities. It was photographed and exploded by the FBI, which launched an investigation.[192][193] For several days afterward, similar bombs were mailed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and several other Democrats and liberals.[194]\nOn October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc was arrested in Aventura, Florida, on suspicion of mailing the bombs.[195]\nSoros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations.  Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.[55] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:[55]\nA recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.[55] Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses.  More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses.  Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans \u2013 the value of the houses \u2013 had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively).  Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.\nThis was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.\nThe concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,[196] but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology.[197]\nThe notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of Complexity economics, as developed at the Santa Fe Institute, although Soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.[198][199][200][201]\nAlthough the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"Open Society\" in the past were from Communism and Fascism (as discussed in The Open Society and Its Enemies by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism.\nHe has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.[202]\nSoros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism.[203]\nSoros's book The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a \"superbubble\" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states:\nI have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in The Alchemy of Finance (in 1987), then in The Crisis of Global Capitalism (in 1998), and now in this book. So it's three books predicting disaster. [After] the boy cried wolf three times ... the wolf really came.[204]\nHe ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong.\nI'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight.  When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.[204]\nIn February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.[205] \"We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom.\"\nIn January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a financial crisis akin to 2008 based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking Chinese yuan.\nChina has a major adjustment problem. I would say it amounts to a crisis. When I look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in 2008.[206][207]\nWhen asked about what he thought about Israel, in The New Yorker, Soros replied: \"I don't deny the Jews to a right to a national existence \u2013 but I don't want anything to do with it.\"[208] According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of \"challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies\" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy.[209] He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies[210][211][212] including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.[210]\nSpeaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of George W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism.  Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the \"Jewish financiers\" who, in antisemitic terms, \"ruled the world by proxy\", suggested that if we change the direction of those policies, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of what's out there, and \"blamed the victim\" when holding Jews responsible for antisemitism.  Jewish philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified, \"George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be.\"[213]  Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by \"giv[ing] up on the tribalness\".[214]\nIn a subsequent article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized that\nI do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.[215]In 2017, Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz filed a $10 million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the government of Guinea to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to \"long-standing animus toward the state of Israel\".[216][217][218] Steinmetz claims that Soros engaged in a \"smear\" campaign against him and his companies and blames Soros for scrutiny of him by American, Israeli, Swiss, and Guinean authorities.[219] Soros called Steinmetz's suit \"frivolous and entirely false\" and said that it was \"a desperate PR stunt meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions\".[220]\nDuring an award ceremony for Imre Kert\u00e9sz, Soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming \"perpetrators of violence\", suggesting that this model explained Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians, which led to walkouts and Soros being booed.[221]\nIn July 2017, in Hungary a billboard campaign backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n which was considered to be anti-semitic by the country's Jewish groups vilified Soros as an enemy of the state using the slogan \"Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh\".[222] The campaign was estimated to have cost 5.7bn forints (then US$21 million).[223] According to the Israeli ambassador the campaign \"evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear\", a reference to Hungary's role in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust.[224] Lydia Gall of Human Rights Watch asserted that it was reminiscent of Nazi posters during the Second World War featuring \"'the laughing Jew'\".[225] Orb\u00e1n and his government's representative said they had a \"zero tolerance\" of antisemitism explaining the posters were aiming to persuade voters Soros was a \"national security risk\".[222]\nHours later, in an apparent attempt to ally Israel with Hungary, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a \"clarification\", denouncing Soros, stating that he \"continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself\".[226]\nSoros' son Alexander said in an interview that his father cares about Israel, and that he \"would like to see Israel in Yitzhak Rabin's image. His views are more or less the common views in Meretz and in the Labor Party.\" According to Alexander, Soros supports a two-state solution. The younger Soros recounts that after his bar mitzvah in 1998, his father told him: \"If you're serious about being Jewish, you might want to consider immigrating to Israel.\"[227]\nOn November 11, 2003, in an interview with The Washington Post, Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the \"central focus of my life\" and \"a matter of life and death\". He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush \"if someone guaranteed it\".[228][229] Soros gave $3\u00a0million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5\u00a0million to MoveOn.org, and $20\u00a0million[230] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech: Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush[231] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The online transcript to this speech received many hits after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as \"factcheck.com\" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site.[232]\nHis 2003 book, The Bubble of American Supremacy[233], was a forthright critique of the Bush administration's \"War on Terror\" as misconceived and counterproductive, and a polemic against the re-election of Bush. He explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the self-reinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices.\nWhen Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in The Age of Fallibility that \"the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States\", he responded that \"it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world ... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims.\"[234]\nSoros described Donald Trump as a con man.[235] Soros expects Trump to fail because Soros believes Trump's ideas are self-contradictory. Soros said in 2017 he believed Trump was preparing for a trade war and expected financial markets to do badly.[236]\nIn October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled \"As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite\",[237] in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis. The letter was co-signed by Javier Solana, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Andrew Duff, Emma Bonino, Massimo D'Alema, Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga.\nSoros criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his handling of the European migrant crisis in 2015: \"His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.\"[238]\nSoros expected that Brexit would fail and the Premiership of Theresa May would last only a short time.[236] Soros is opposed to Brexit and donated \u00a3400,000 to the anti-Brexit 'Best for Britain' group.[239] Soros also hosted a dinner for Conservative donors at his London home to encourage them to follow his lead. Soros's Open Society Foundations also donated a total of \u00a3303,000 to two pro-EU organizations, the European Movement UK and Scientists for EU, and a center-right think-tank, Bright Blue.[240]\nIn 2018, Soros highlighted that Europe faces major challenges, in particular, that related to immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the political block.[241] He holds that Europe is facing an existential crisis, in view of the rise of populism, the refugee crisis and a growing rift between Europe and the United States.[242] Soros has also stated that \"the euro has many unresolved problems\" which \"must not be allowed to destroy the European Union\". He advocated replacing the notion of a multi-speed Europe by the aim of a \"multi-track Europe\" that would allow member states a wider variety of choices.[243]\nIn view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a Marshall Plan for Africa (see Marshall Plan), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration.[241][243]\nSoros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, \"China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests ... They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well.\"  Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, \"Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States.\"[244] In July 2015, Soros stated that a \"strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict\".[245]  In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that \"[a] hard landing is practically unavoidable\".  Chinese state media responded by stating \"Soros' challenge to the RMB and Hong Kong dollar are doomed to fail, without any doubt.\"[246]\nIn January 2019, Soros used his annual speech at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, to label Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of China, as the \"most dangerous opponent of open societies\", saying: \"China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced\". He also urged the United States not to allow the Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE to dominate the 5G telecommunications market as this would present an \"unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world\".[247][248] Soros also criticized the newest form of China's Big Brother-like system of mass surveillance called the Social Credit System, saying it would give Xi, \"total control\" over the people of China.\"[249]\nIn May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: \"I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now.\"[250]\nIn January 2015, Soros said that \"Europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from Russia.\" He also urged Western countries to expand economic sanctions against Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.[251]\nIn January 2015, Soros called on the European Union to give $50\u00a0billion of bailout money to Ukraine.[252]\nIn July 2015, Soros stated that Putin's annexation of Crimea was a challenge to the \"prevailing world order,\" specifically the European Union. He hypothesized that Putin wants to \"destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support.\"[245] In November 2015, Russia banned the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI)-- two pro-democracy charities founded by Soros\u2014stating they posed a \"threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state.\"[253][254] In January 2016, 53 books related to Soros's \"Renewal of Humanitarian Education\" program were withdrawn at the Vorkuta Mining and Economic College in the Komi Republic, with 427 additional books seized for shredding. A Russian intergovernmental letter released in December 2015 stated that Soros's charities were \"forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives, alien to Russian ideology, popular\". Most of these books were published with funds donated by Soros's charities.[255][256]\nAs of February\u00a02017[update], Forbes magazine listed Soros as the 29th richest person in the world,[257] the world's richest hedge-fund manager, and 19th on its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans,[258] with a net worth estimated at $25.2\u00a0billion.[259] This was after Soros had lost almost $1 billion in the weeks after the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president in 2016.[260]\nSoros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa,[111] and began funding dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain.\nSoros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent democratization in the post-Soviet states. These efforts, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the Open Society Foundations (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland). As of 2003, PBS estimated that he had given away a total of $4\u00a0billion.[82] The OSI says it has spent about $500\u00a0million annually in recent years.\nIn 2003, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker wrote in the foreword of Soros's book The Alchemy of Finance:\nGeorge Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game. The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become \"open societies\", open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but\u2014more important\u2014tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.[261]Time magazine in 2007 cited two specific projects\u2014$100\u00a0million toward Internet infrastructure for regional Russian universities, and $50\u00a0million for the Millennium Promise to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa\u2014noting that Soros had given $742\u00a0million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7\u00a0billion.[262]\nOther notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, and Transparency International. Soros also pledged an endowment of \u20ac420\u00a0million to the Central European University (CEU).\nAccording to National Review Online[263] the Open Society Institute gave $20,000 in September 2002 to the Defense Committee of Lynne Stewart, the lawyer who has defended controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to 21/3 years in prison for \"providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy\" via a press conference for a client. An OSI spokeswoman said \"it appeared to us at that time that there was a right-to-counsel issue worthy of our support\" but claimed later requests for support were declined.[264]\nIn September 2006, Soros pledged $50\u00a0million to the Millennium Promise, led by economist Jeffrey Sachs to provide educational, agricultural, and medical aid to help villages in Africa enduring poverty. The New York Times termed this endeavor a \"departure\" for Soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government, but Soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance.[265]\nSoros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in Hungary (1984\u201389)[19] and provided a substantial endowment to Central European University in Budapest.[266] The Open Society Foundations has active programs in more than 60 countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately $600\u00a0million a year.[3][267]\nOn October 17, 2017, it was announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion to the Open Society Foundations.[268]\nIn October 2018, Soros donated $2 million to the Wikimedia Foundation via the Wikimedia Endowment program.[269]\nSoros received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social Research (New York), the University of Oxford in 1980, the Corvinus University of Budapest, and Yale University in 1991. He received an honorary degree in economics from the University of Bologna in 1995.[270]\nIn 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A. Cohen.[271]\nIn January 2014, Soros was ranked number 1 in LCH Investments list of top 20 managers having posting gains of almost $42 billion since the launch of his Quantum Endowment Fund in 1973.[272]\nIn July 2017, Soros was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.[273]\nSoros was the Financial Times Person of the Year for 2018, with the FT describing him as \"a standard bearer for liberal democracy, an idea under siege from populists\".[274]\nIn April 2019 Soros was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Courage.[275] In his acceptance address Soros said: \"In my native Hungary, the government of [Prime Minister] Viktor Orb\u00e1n has turned me into the super villain of an alleged plot to destroy the supposed Christian identity of the Hungarian nation... [I] donate the prize money associated with this award to the Hungarian Spectrum, an online English-language publication that provides daily updates on Hungarian politics. It renders an important service by exposing to the world [in English] what Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is telling his own people [in Hungarian]. It [Hungarian Spectrum] deserves to be better known and supported.\"[276]\nGeorge Soros has written many books, articles, and papers on economics, finance, stock trading, and geopolitics.\n</body></html>"

His father, Hafez al-Assad, was also President of Syria from 1971 to 2000. Born and raised in Damascus, Assad graduated from the medical school of Damascus University in 1988 and began to work as a doctor in the Syrian Army. Four years later, he attended postgraduate studies at the Western Eye Hospital in London, specialising in ophthalmology. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel died in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as heir apparent. He entered the military academy, taking charge of the Syrian military presence in Lebanon in 1998. Political scientists have characterized the Assad family's rule of Syria as a personalist dictatorship.[2][3][4][5][6] On 10 July 2000, Assad was elected as President, succeeding his father, who died in office a month prior. In the 2000 and subsequent 2007 election, he received 99.7% and 97.6% support, respectively, in non-competitive, non-democratic elections.[7][8][9] On 16 July 2014, Assad was sworn in for another seven-year term after winning another non-competitive, non-democratic election.[10][11][12] The election was held only in areas controlled by the Syrian government during the country's ongoing civil war and was criticized by the UN, the Syrian opposition and its Western countries,[13][14] while Syria's allies stated that the election was \"free and fair\".[15][16][17] The Assad government describes itself as secular,[18] while some political scientists have claimed that the government exploits sectarian tensions in the country and relies upon the Alawite minority to remain in power.[19][20] Previously seen by many states as a potential reformer, the United States, the European Union and the majority of the Arab League called for Assad's resignation from the presidency after he ordered crackdowns and military sieges on Arab Spring protesters, which led to the Syrian Civil War.[21][22] During the Syrian Civil War, an inquiry by the United Nations reported finding evidence which implicated Assad in war crimes.[23] The UN and international chemical weapons inspectors also concluded that the Assad regime has been behind chemical weapons attacks against civilians.[24] In June 2014, Assad was included in a list of war crimes indictments of government officials and rebels handed to the International Criminal Court.[25] Assad has rejected allegations of war crimes and criticised the American-led intervention in Syria for attempting regime change.[26][27] Bashar Hafez al-Assad was born in Damascus on 11 September 1965, the second oldest son of Anisa Makhlouf and Hafez al-Assad.[28] Al-Assad in Arabic means \"the Lion\". Assad's paternal grandfather, Ali Sulayman al-Assad, had managed to change his status from peasant to minor notable and, to reflect this, in 1927 he had changed the family name from Wahsh (meaning \"Savage\") to Al-Assad.[29] Assad's father, Hafez, was born to an impoverished rural family of Alawite background and rose through the Ba'ath Party ranks to take control of the Syrian branch of the Party in the 1970 Corrective Revolution, culminating in his rise to the Syrian presidency.[30] Hafez promoted his supporters within the Ba'ath Party, many of whom were also of Alawite background.[28][31] After the revolution, Alawite strongmen were installed while Sunnis, Druzes, and Ismailis were removed from the army and Ba'ath party.[32] The younger Assad had five siblings, three of whom are deceased. A sister named Bushra died in infancy.[33] Assad's youngest brother, Majd, was not a public figure and little is known about him other than he was intellectually disabled,[34] and died in 2009 after a \"long illness\".[35] Unlike his brothers Bassel and Maher, and second sister, also named Bushra, Bashar was quiet, reserved and lacked interest in politics or the military.[36][34][37] The Assad children reportedly rarely saw their father,[38] and Bashar later stated that he only entered his father's office once while he was president.[39] He was described as \"soft-spoken\",[40] and according to a university friend, he was timid, avoided eye contact and speaking in a low voice.[41] Assad received his primary and secondary education in the Arab-French al-Hurriya School in Damascus.[36] In 1982, he graduated from high school and then studied medicine at Damascus University.[42] In 1988, Assad graduated from medical school and began working as an army doctor at the Tishrin Military Hospital on the outskirts of Damascus.[43][44] Four years later, he settled in London to start postgraduate training in ophthalmology at the Western Eye Hospital.[45] He was described as a \"geeky I.T. guy\" during his time in London.[46] Bashar had few political aspirations,[47] and his father had been grooming Bashar's older brother Bassel as the future president.[48] However, Bassel died in a car accident in 1994 and Bashar was recalled to the Syrian Army shortly thereafter. Soon after the death of Bassel, Hafez al-Assad decided to make Bashar the new heir apparent.[49] Over the next six and a half years, until his death in 2000, Hafez prepared Bashar for taking over power. Preparations for a smooth transition were made on three levels. First, support was built up for Bashar in the military and security apparatus. Second, Bashar's image was established with the public. And lastly, Bashar was familiarised with the mechanisms of running the country.[50] To establish his credentials in the military, Bashar entered the military academy at Homs in 1994 and was propelled through the ranks to become a colonel of the elite Syrian Republican Guard in January 1999.[43][51][52] To establish a power base for Bashar in the military, old divisional commanders were pushed into retirement, and new, young, Alawite officers with loyalties to him took their place.[53] In 1998, Bashar took charge of Syria's Lebanon file, which had since the 1970s been handled by Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam, who had until then been a potential contender for president.[53] By taking charge of Syrian affairs in Lebanon, Bashar was able to push Khaddam aside and establish his own power base in Lebanon.[54] In the same year, after minor consultation with Lebanese politicians, Bashar installed Emile Lahoud, a loyal ally of his, as the President of Lebanon and pushed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri aside, by not placing his political weight behind his nomination as prime minister.[55] To further weaken the old Syrian order in Lebanon, Bashar replaced the long serving de facto Syrian High Commissioner of Lebanon, Ghazi Kanaan, with Rustum Ghazaleh.[56] Parallel to his military career, Bashar was engaged in public affairs. He was granted wide powers and became head of the bureau to receive complaints and appeals of citizens, and led a campaign against corruption. As a result of this campaign, many of Bashar's potential rivals for president were put on trial for corruption.[43] Bashar also became the President of the Syrian Computer Society and helped to introduce the internet in Syria, which aided his image as a moderniser and reformer.[57] Asia portal History portal After the death of Hafez al-Assad on 10 June 2000, the Constitution of Syria was amended; the minimum age requirement for the presidency was lowered from 40 to 34, which was Bashar's age at the time.[58] Assad was then confirmed president on 10 July 2000, with 99.7% support for his leadership. In line with his role as President of Syria, he was also appointed the commander-in-chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and Regional Secretary of the Ba'ath Party.[57] Immediately after he took office, a reform movement made cautious advances during the Damascus Spring, which led to the shut down of Mezzeh prison and the declaration of a wide-ranging amnesty releasing hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood affiliated political prisoners.[59] However, security crackdowns commenced again within the year.[60][61] Many analysts stated that reform under Assad had been inhibited by the \"old guard\", members of the government loyal to his late father.[57] During the War on terror, Assad allied his country with the West. Syria was a major site of extraordinary rendition by the CIA of al-Qaeda suspects, who were interrogated in Syrian prisons.[62][63][64] Soon after Assad assumed power, he \"made Syria's link with Hezbollah \u2013 and its patrons in Tehran \u2013 the central component of his security doctrine\",[65] and in his foreign policy, Assad is an outspoken critic of the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.[66] In 2005 Rafic Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon, was assassinated. The Christian Science Monitor reported that \"Syria was widely blamed for Hariri's murder. In the months leading to the assassination, relations between Hariri and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plummeted amid an atmosphere of threats and intimidation.\"[67] The BBC reported in December 2005 that an interim United Nations report \"implicated Syrian officials\", while \"Damascus has strongly denied involvement in the car bomb which killed Hariri in February\".[68] On 27 May 2007, Assad was approved for another seven-year term in a referendum on his presidency, with 97.6% of the votes supporting his continued leadership.[69] Mass protests in Syria began on 26 January 2011. Protesters called for political reforms and the reinstatement of civil rights, as well as an end to the state of emergency which had been in place since 1963.[70] One attempt at a \"day of rage\" was set for 4\u20135 February, though it ended uneventfully.[71] Protests on 18\u201319 March were the largest to take place in Syria for decades, and the Syrian authority responded with violence against its protesting citizens.[72] The U.S. imposed limited sanctions against the Assad government in April 2011, followed by Barack Obama's executive order as of 18 May 2011 targeting Bashar Assad specifically and six other senior officials.[73][74][75] On 23 May 2011, the EU foreign ministers agreed at a meeting in Brussels to add Assad and nine other officials to a list affected by travel bans and asset freezes.[76] On 24 May 2011, Canada imposed sanctions on Syrian leaders, including Assad.[77] On 20 June, in response to the demands of protesters and foreign pressure, Assad promised a national dialogue involving movement toward reform, new parliamentary elections, and greater freedoms. He also urged refugees to return home from Turkey, while assuring them amnesty and blaming all unrest on a small number of saboteurs.[78] Assad blamed the unrest on \"conspiracies\" and accused the Syrian opposition and protestors of \"fitna\", breaking with the Syrian Ba'ath Party's strict tradition of secularism.[79] In July 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Assad had \"lost legitimacy\" as President.[74] On 18 August 2011, Barack Obama issued a written statement that urged Assad to \"step aside\".[80][81] In August, the cartoonist Ali Farzat, a critic of Assad's government, was attacked. Relatives of the humourist told media outlets that the attackers threatened to break Farzat's bones as a warning for him to stop drawing cartoons of government officials, particularly Assad. Farzat was hospitalised with fractures in both hands and blunt force trauma to the head.[82][83] Since October 2011, Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, repeatedly vetoed Western-sponsored draft resolutions in the UN Security Council that would have left open the possibility of UN sanctions, or even military intervention, against the Assad government.[84][85][86] By the end of January 2012, it was reported by Reuters that over 5,000 civilians and protesters (including armed militants) had been killed by the Syrian army, security agents and militia (Shabiha), while 1,100 people had been killed by \"terrorist armed forces\".[87] On 10 January 2012, Assad gave a speech in which he maintained the uprising was engineered by foreign countries and proclaimed that \"victory [was] near\". He also said that the Arab League, by suspending Syria, revealed that it was no longer Arab. However, Assad also said the country would not \"close doors\" to an Arab-brokered solution if \"national sovereignty\" was respected. He also said a referendum on a new constitution could be held in March.[88] On 27 February 2012, Syria claimed that a proposal that a new constitution be drafted received 90% support during the relevant referendum. The referendum introduced a fourteen-year cumulative term limit for the president of Syria. The referendum was pronounced meaningless by foreign nations including the U.S. and Turkey; the European Union announced fresh sanctions against key regime figures.[89] In July 2012, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denounced Western powers for what he said amounted to blackmail thus provoking a civil war in Syria.[90] On 15 July 2012, the International Committee of the Red Cross declared Syria to be in a state of civil war,[91] as the nationwide death toll for all sides was reported to have neared 20,000.[92] On 6 January 2013, Assad, in his first major speech since June, said that the conflict in his country was due to \"enemies\" outside of Syria who would \"go to Hell\" and that they would \"be taught a lesson\". However, he said that he was still open to a political solution saying that failed attempts at a solution \"does not mean we are not interested in a political solution.\"[93][94] After the fall of four military bases in September 2014,[95] which were the last government footholds in the Raqqa Governorate, Assad received significant criticism from his Alawite base of support.[96] This included remarks made by Douraid al-Assad, cousin of Bashar al-Assad, demanding the resignation of the Syrian Defence Minister, Fahd Jassem al-Freij, following the massacre by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of hundreds of government troops captured after the ISIL victory at Tabqa Airbase.[97] This was shortly followed by Alawite protests in Homs demanding the resignation of the governor,[98] and the dismissal of Assad's cousin Hafez Makhlouf from his security position leading to his subsequent exile to Belarus.[99] Growing resentment towards Assad among Alawites was fuelled by the disproportionate number of soldiers killed in fighting hailing from Alawite areas,[100] a sense that the Assad regime has abandoned them,[101] as well as the failing economic situation.[102] Figures close to Assad began voicing concerns regarding the likelihood of its survival, with one saying in late 2014; \"I don't see the current situation as sustainable ... I think Damascus will collapse at some point.\"[95] In 2015, several members of the Assad family died in Latakia under unclear circumstances.[103] On 14 March, an influential cousin of Assad and founder of the shabiha, Mohammed Toufic al-Assad, was assassinated with five bullets to the head in a dispute over influence in Qardaha\u2014the ancestral home of the Assad family.[104] In April 2015, Assad ordered the arrest of his cousin Munther al-Assad in Alzirah, Latakia.[105] It remains unclear whether the arrest was due to actual crimes.[106] After a string of government defeats in northern and southern Syria, analysts noted growing government instability coupled with continued waning support for the Assad government among its core Alawite base of support,[107] and that there were increasing reports of Assad relatives, Alawites, and businessmen fleeing Damascus for Latakia and foreign countries.[108][109] Intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk was placed under house arrest sometime in April and stood accused of plotting with Assad's exiled uncle Rifaat al-Assad to replace Bashar as president.[110] Further high-profile deaths included the commanders of the Fourth Armoured Division, the Belli military airbase, the army's special forces and of the First Armoured Division, with an errant air strike during the Palmyra offensive killing two officers who were reportedly related to Assad.[111] In early September 2015, against the backdrop of reports that Russia was deploying troops in Syria ready for combat, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that while such talk was \"premature\", Russia was \"already providing Syria with sufficiently serious help: with both equipment and training soldiers, with our weapons\".[112][113] Shortly after the start of direct military intervention by Russia on 30 September 2015 at the formal request of the Syrian government, Putin stated the military operation had been thoroughly prepared in advance and defined Russia's goal in Syria as \"stabilising the legitimate power in Syria and creating the conditions for political compromise\".[114] In November 2015, Assad reiterated that a diplomatic process to bring the country's civil war to an end could not begin while it was occupied by \"terrorists\", although it was considered by BBC News to be unclear whether he meant only ISIL or Western-supported rebels as well.[115] On 22 November, Assad said that within two months of its air campaign Russia had achieved more in its fight against ISIL than the U.S.-led coalition had achieved in a year.[116] In an interview with \u010cesk\u00e1 televize on 1 December, he said that the leaders who demanded his resignation were of no interest to him, as nobody takes them seriously because they are \"shallow\" and controlled by the U.S.[117][118] At the end of December 2015, senior U.S. officials privately admitted that Russia had achieved its central goal of stabilising Syria and, with the costs relatively low, could sustain the operation at this level for years to come.[119] In January 2016, Putin stated that Russia was supporting Assad's forces and was ready to back anti-Assad rebels as long as they were fighting ISIL.[120] On 11 January 2016, the senior Russian defence ministry official said that the \"Russian air force was striking in support of eleven groups of democratic opposition that number over seven thousand people.\"[121] On 22 January 2016, the Financial Times, citing anonymous \"senior western intelligence officials\", claimed that Russian general Igor Sergun, the director of GRU, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, had shortly before his sudden death on 3 January 2016 been sent to Damascus with a message from Vladimir Putin asking that President Assad step aside.[122] The Financial Times' report was promptly denied by Putin's spokesman.[123] It was reported in December 2016 that Assad's forces had retaken half of rebel-held Aleppo, ending a 6-year stalemate in the city.[124][125] On 15 December, as it was reported government forces were on the brink of retaking all of Aleppo\u2014a \"turning point\" in the Civil War, Assad celebrated the liberation of the city, and stated, \"History is being written by every Syrian citizen.\"[126] After the election of Donald Trump, the priority of the United States concerning Assad was unlike the priority of the Obama administration, and in March 2017 United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley stated the U.S. was no longer focused on \"getting Assad out\",[127] but this position changed in the wake of the 2017 Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[128] Following the missile strikes on a Syrian airbase on the orders of President Trump, Assad's spokesperson described the United States' behaviour as \"unjust and arrogant aggression\" and stated that the missile strikes \"do not change the deep policies\" of the Syrian government.[129] President Assad also told the Agence France-Presse that Syria's military had given up all its chemical weapons in 2013, and would not have used them if they still retained any, and stated that the chemical attack was a \"100 percent fabrication\" used to justify a U.S. airstrike.[130] In June 2017, Russian President Putin said \"Assad didn't use the [chemical weapons]\" and that the chemical attack was \"done by people who wanted to blame him for that.\"[131] United Nations and international chemical weapons inspectors found the attack was the work of the Assad regime.[24] On 7 November 2017, the Syrian government announced that it had signed the Paris Climate Agreement.[132] According to ABC News, as a result of the Syrian Civil War, \"government-controlled Syria is truncated in size, battered and impoverished\".[133] Economic sanctions (the Syria Accountability Act) were applied long before the Syrian Civil War by the United States and were joined by the European Union at the outbreak of the civil war, causing disintegration of the Syrian economy.[134] These sanctions were reinforced in October 2014 by the EU and U.S.[135][136] Industry in parts of the country that are still held by the government is heavily state-controlled, with economic liberalisation being reversed during the current conflict.[137] The London School of Economics has stated that as a result of the Syrian Civil War, a war economy has developed in Syria.[138] A 2014 European Council on Foreign Relations report also stated that a war economy has formed: Three years into a conflict that is estimated to have killed at least 140,000 people from both sides, much of the Syrian economy lies in ruins. As the violence has expanded and sanctions have been imposed, assets and infrastructure have been destroyed, economic output has fallen, and investors have fled the country. Unemployment now exceeds 50 percent and half of the population lives below the poverty line ... against this backdrop, a war economy is emerging that is creating significant new economic networks and business activities that feed off the violence, chaos, and lawlessness gripping the country. This war economy \u2013 to which Western sanctions have inadvertently contributed \u2013 is creating incentives for some Syrians to prolong the conflict and making it harder to end it.[139] A United Nations commissioned report by the Syrian Centre for Policy Research states that two-thirds of the Syrian population now lives in \"extreme poverty\".[140] Unemployment stands at 50 percent.[141] In October 2014, a $50 million mall opened in Tartus which provoked criticism from government supporters and was seen as part of an Assad government policy of attempting to project a sense of normalcy throughout the civil war.[142] A government policy to give preference to families of slain soldiers for government jobs was cancelled after it caused an uproar[100] while rising accusations of corruption caused protests.[102] In December 2014, the EU banned sales of jet fuel to the Assad government, forcing the government to buy more expensive uninsured jet fuel shipments in the future.[143] A 2007 law required internet caf\u00e9s to record all the comments users post on chat forums.[144] Websites such as Arabic Wikipedia, YouTube, and Facebook were blocked intermittently between 2008 and February 2011.[145][146][147] Human Rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have detailed how the Assad government's secret police allegedly tortured, imprisoned, and killed political opponents, and those who speak out against the government.[148][149] In addition, some 600 Lebanese political prisoners are thought to be held in government prisons since the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, with some held for as long as over 30 years.[150] Since 2006, the Assad government has expanded the use of travel bans against political dissidents.[151] In an interview with ABC News in 2007, Assad stated: \"We don't have such [things as] political prisoners,\" though The New York Times reported the arrest of 30 Syrian political dissidents who were organising a joint opposition front in December 2007, with 3 members of this group considered to be opposition leaders being remanded in custody.[152] In 2010, Syria banned face veils at universities.[153][154] Following the Syrian uprising in 2011, Assad partially relaxed the veil ban.[155] Foreign Policy magazine released an editorial on Assad's position in the wake of the 2011 protests:[156] During its decades of rule... the Assad family developed a strong political safety net by firmly integrating the military into the government. In 1970, Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, seized power after rising through the ranks of the Syrian armed forces, during which time he established a network of loyal Alawites by installing them in key posts. In fact, the military, ruling elite, and ruthless secret police are so intertwined that it is now impossible to separate the Assad government from the security establishment.... So... the government and its loyal forces have been able to deter all but the most resolute and fearless oppositional activists. In this respect, the situation in Syria is to a certain degree comparable to Saddam Hussein's strong Sunni minority rule in Iraq. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that at least 10 European citizens were tortured by the Assad government while detained during the Syrian Civil War, potentially leaving Assad open to prosecution by individual European countries for war crimes.[157] Stephen Rapp, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, has argued that the crimes allegedly committed by Assad are the worst seen since those of Nazi Germany.[158] In March 2015, Rapp further stated that the case against Assad is \"much better\" than those against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 of Serbia or Charles Taylor of Liberia, both of whom were indicted by international tribunals.[159] In a February 2015 interview with the BBC, Assad described accusations that the Syrian Arab Air Force used barrel bombs as \"childish\", stating that his forces have never used these types of \"barrel\" bombs and responded with a joke about not using \"cooking pots\" either.[160] The BBC Middle East editor conducting the interview, Jeremy Bowen, later described Assad's statement regarding barrel bombs as \"patently not true\".[161][162] Nadim Shehadi, the director of The Fares Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies, stated that \"In the early 1990s, Saddam Hussein was massacring his people and we were worried about the weapons inspectors,\" and claimed that \"Assad did that too. He kept us busy with chemical weapons when he massacred his people.\"[163][164] In September 2015, France began an inquiry into Assad for crimes against humanity, with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius stating \"Faced with these crimes that offend the human conscience, this bureaucracy of horror, faced with this denial of the values of humanity, it is our responsibility to act against the impunity of the killers\".[165] In February 2016, head of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, Paulo Pinheiro, told reporters: \"The mass scale of deaths of detainees suggests that the government of Syria is responsible for acts that amount to extermination as a crime against humanity.\" The UN Commission reported finding \"unimaginable abuses\", including women and children as young as seven perishing while being held by Syrian authorities. The report also stated: \"There are reasonable grounds to believe that high-ranking officers\u2014including the heads of branches and directorates\u2014commanding these detention facilities, those in charge of the military police, as well as their civilian superiors, knew of the vast number of deaths occurring in detention facilities ... yet did not take action to prevent abuse, investigate allegations or prosecute those responsible\".[166] In March 2016, the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs led by New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith called on the Obama administration to create a war crimes tribunal to investigate and prosecute violations \"whether committed by the officials of the Government of Syria or other parties to the civil war\".[167] In April 2017, there was a sarin chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people. The attack prompted US President Donald Trump to order the US military to launch 59 missiles at a Syrian airbase.[168] Several months later, a joint report from the United Nations and international chemical weapons inspectors found the attack was the work of the Assad regime.[24] In April 2018, an alleged chemical attack occurred in Douma, prompting the U.S. and its and allies to accuse Assad of violating international laws and initiating the 2018 bombing of Damascus and Homs. Both Syria and Russia have refuted the involvement of the Syrian government at this time.[169][170] In June 2018, Germany's chief prosecutor issued an international arrest warrant for one of Assad's most senior military officials, Jamil Hassan.[171] Hassan is the head of Syria's powerful Air Force Intelligence Directorate. Detention centers run by Air Force Intelligence are among the most notorious in Syria, and thousands are believed to have died because of torture or neglect. Charges filed against Hassan claim he had command responsibility over the facilities and therefore knew of the abuse. The move against Hassan marked an important milestone of prosecutors trying to bring senior members of Assad's inner circle to trial for war crimes. In June 2019, United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that the United States \u201cwill respond quickly and appropriately,\u201d if the regime uses chemical weapons again. He added that Bashar al-Assad has done more than any other to destabilize the region by \"murdering his own people\" and that both Russia and the Syrian regime have shown no concern for the suffering of the Syrian people creating one of the \"worst humanitarian tragedies in history\".[172] Assad opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq despite a long-standing animosity between the Syrian and Iraqi governments. Assad used Syria's seat in one of the rotating positions on the United Nations Security Council to try to prevent the invasion of Iraq.[173] According to veteran U.S intelligence officer Malcolm Nance, the Syrian government had developed deep relations with former Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri. Despite the historical differences between the two Ba'ath factions, al-Douri reportedly urged Saddam to open oil pipelines with Syria, building a financial relationship with the Assad family. After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, al-Douri allegedly fled to Damascus where he organised the National Command of the Islamic Resistance which co-ordinated major combat operations during the Iraqi insurgency.[174][175] In 2009, General David Petraeus, who was at the time heading the United States Central Command, told reporters from Al Arabiya that al-Douri was residing in Syria.[176] The U.S commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, George W. Casey Jr., accused Assad of providing funding, logistics, and training to insurgents in Iraq to launch attacks against U.S. and allied forces occupying Iraq.[177] Iraqi leaders such as former national security advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie and former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have accused Assad of harbouring and supporting Iraqi militants.[178][179] Diplomatic relations with Egypt were re-established in 2005 under his rule. In 1978, his father Hafez al-Assad severed diplomatic relations with the country after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat signed a peace treaty with Israel in the Camp David Accords.[citation needed] However, at the outset of the Arab Spring, Syrian state media focused primarily upon Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, demonising him as pro-U.S. and comparing him unfavourably with Assad.[180] Assad told The Wall Street Journal in this same period that he considered himself \"anti-Israel\" and \"anti-West\", and that because of these policies he was not in danger of being overthrown.[66] Following the election of Muslim Brotherhood politician Mohamed Morsi as the next Egyptian president, relations became extremely strained. The Muslim Brotherhood is a banned organisation and its membership is a capital offence in Syria. Egypt severed all relations with Syria in June 2013.[citation needed] Diplomatic relations were restored and the embassies reopened after Morsi regime was deposed just weeks later by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In July 2013, the two countries agreed to reopen the Egyptian consulate in Damascus and the Syrian consulate in Cairo.[181] In late-November 2016, some Arab media outlets reported Egyptian pilots arrived in mid-November to Syria to help the Syrian government in its fight against the Islamic State and Al Nusra front.[182] This came after Sisi publicly stated he supports the Syrian military in the civil war in Syria.[183] However, several days later, Egypt officially denied it has a military presence in Syria.[184] Although Egypt has not been vocal in support for any sides of Syria's ongoing civil war, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said in 2016 that his nation's priority is \"supporting national armies\", which he said included the Syrian Armed Forces.[185] He also said regarding Egypt's stance in the conflict: \"Our stance in Egypt is to respect the will of the Syrian people, and that a political solution to the Syrian crisis is the most suitable way, and to seriously deal with terrorist groups and disarm them,\".[185] Egypt's support for a political solution was reaffirmed in February 2017. Egypt's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said that Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, \"during his meeting with UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, on Saturday confirmed Egypt\u2019s rejection of any military intervention that would violate Syrian sovereignty and undermine opportunities of the standing political solutions.\u201d[186] Egypt has also expressed great interest in rebuilding postwar Syria, with many Egyptian companies and businessmen discussing investment opportunities in Syria as well as participation in the reconstruction effort. Tarik al-Nabrawi, president of Egypt's Engineers Syndicate said that 2018 will witness a \u201cboom and influential role for Egyptian construction companies in Syria and to open the door for other companies \u2014 in the electricity, building material, steel, aluminum, ceramics and sanitary material fields among others \u2014 to work in the Syrian market and participate in rebuilding cities and facilities that the war has destroyed.\u201d[187] On 25 February 2018, Syrian state news reported that an Egyptian delegation composed of \"members of the Islamic and Arab Assembly for supporting Resistance and Future Pioneers movement as well as a number of figures\", including Jamal Zahran and Farouk Hassan, visited the Syrian consulate in Cairo to express solidarity with the Syrian government.[188][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Assad argued that Syria's gradual withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, beginning in 2000, was a result of the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri and ended in May 2005.[189] According to testimony submitted to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, when talking to Rafic Hariri at the Presidential Palace in Damascus in August 2004, Assad allegedly said to him, \"I will break Lebanon over your [Hariri's] head and over Walid Jumblatt's head\" if \u00c9mile Lahoud was not allowed to remain in office despite Hariri's objections; that incident was thought to be linked to Hariri's subsequent assassination.[190] In early 2015, journalist and ad hoc Lebanese-Syrian intermediary Ali Hamade stated before the Special Tribunal for Lebanon that Rafic Hariri's attempts to reduce tensions with Syria were considered a \"mockery\" by Assad.[191] Despite gaining re-election in 2007, Assad's position was considered by some to have been weakened by the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon following the Cedar Revolution in 2005. There has also been pressure from the U.S. concerning claims that Syria is linked to terrorist networks, exacerbated by Syrian condemnation of the assassination of Hezbollah military leader, Imad Mughniyah, in Damascus in 2008. Interior Minister Bassam Abdul-Majeed stated that \"Syria, which condemns this cowardly terrorist act, expresses condolences to the martyr family and to the Lebanese people.\"[192] In May 2015, Lebanese politician Michel Samaha was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail for his role in a terrorist bomb plot that he claimed Assad was aware of.[193] The United States, the European Union, the March 14 Alliance, and France accuse Assad of providing support to militant groups active against Israel and opposition political groups. The latter category would include most political parties other than Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine.[194] In a speech about the 2006 Lebanon War in August 2006, Assad said that Hezbollah had \"hoisted the banner of victory\", hailing its actions as a \"successful resistance\".[195] In April 2008, Assad told a Qatari newspaper that Syria and Israel had been discussing a peace treaty for a year. This was confirmed in May 2008, by a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. As well as the treaty, the future of the Golan Heights was being discussed. Assad was quoted in The Guardian as telling the Qatari paper: ... there would be no direct negotiations with Israel until a new US president takes office. The US was the only party qualified to sponsor any direct talks, [Assad] told the paper, but added that the Bush administration \"does not have the vision or will for the peace process. It does not have anything.\"[196]According to leaked American cables, Assad called Hamas an \"uninvited guest\" and said \"If you want me to be effective and active, I have to have a relationship with all parties. Hamas is Muslim Brotherhood, but we have to deal with the reality of their presence,\" comparing Hamas to the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood which was crushed by his father, Hafez al-Assad. He also said Hamas would disappear if peace was brought to the Middle East.[197][198] Assad has indicated that the peace treaty that he envisions would not be the same kind of peace treaty Israel has with Egypt, where there is a legal border crossing and open trade. In a 2006 interview with Charlie Rose, Assad said: \"There is a big difference between talking about a peace treaty and peace. A peace treaty is like a permanent ceasefire. There's no war, maybe you have an embassy, but you actually won't have trade, you won't have normal relations because people will not be sympathetic to this relation as long as they are sympathetic with the Palestinians: half a million who live in Syria and half a million in Lebanon and another few millions in other Arab countries.\"[189] During the visit of Pope John Paul II to Syria in 2001, Assad requested an apology to Muslims for the Crusades and criticised Israeli treatment of Palestinians, stating that \"territories in Lebanon, the Golan and Palestine have been occupied by those who killed the principle of equality when they claimed that God created a people distinguished above all other peoples\".[199] He also compared the suffering of Palestinians at the hands of the Israelis to the suffering endured by Jesus in Judea, and said that \"they tried to kill the principles of all religions with the same mentality in which they betrayed Jesus Christ and the same way they tried to betray and kill the Prophet Muhammad\".[200][201][202][203] Responding to accusations that his comment was antisemitic, Assad said that \"We in Syria reject the term antisemitism. ... Semites are a race and [Syrians] not only belong to this race, but are its core. Judaism, on the other hand, is a religion which can be attributed to all races.\"[204] He also stated that \"I was talking about Israelis, not Jews. ... When I say Israel carries out killings, it's the reality: Israel tortures Palestinians. I didn't speak about Jews,\" and criticised Western media outlets for misinterpreting his comments.[205] In February 2011, Assad backed an initiative to restore ten synagogues in Syria, which had a Jewish community numbering 30,000 in 1947, but only 200 Jews by 2011.[206] Assad met with U.S. scientists and policy leaders during a science diplomacy visit in 2009, and he expressed interest in building research universities and using science and technology to promote innovation and economic growth.[207] In response to Executive Order 13769 which mandated refugees from Syria be indefinitely suspended from being able to resettle in the United States, Assad appeared to defend the measure, stating \"It's against the terrorists that would infiltrate some of the immigrants to the West... I think the aim of Trump is to prevent those people from coming,\" adding that it was \"not against the Syrian people\".[208] This reaction was in contrast to other leaders of countries affected by the Executive Order who condemned it.[209] North Korea has allegedly aided Syria in developing and enhancing a ballistic missiles programme.[210][211] They also reportedly helped Syria develop a suspected nuclear reactor in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. U.S. officials claimed the reactor was probably \"not intended for peaceful purposes\", but American senior intelligence officials doubted it was meant for the production of nuclear weapons.[212] The supposed nuclear reactor was destroyed by the Israeli Air Force in 2007 during Operation Orchard.[213] Following the airstrike, Syria wrote a letter to Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon calling the incursion a \"breach of airspace of the Syrian Arab Republic\" and \"not the first time Israel has violated\" Syrian airspace.[214] While hosting an 8 March 2015 delegation from North Korea led by North Korean Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sin Hong Chol, Assad stated that Syria and North Korea were being \"targeted\" because they are \"among those few countries which enjoy real independence\".[215] According to Syrian opposition sources, North Korea has sent army units to fight on behalf of Assad in the Syrian Civil War.[216] In 2018, the United Nations exposed North Korea for their facilitation of Syria's development of chemical weapons. According to a report by U.N. investigators, North Korea provided the Syrian government with acid-resistant tiles, valves, and thermometers. Additionally, DPRK missile technicians had been seen inside various Syrian chemical weapons facilities. This series of about 40 unreported shipments between North Korea and Syria, on which were the chemical weapons materials as well as prohibited ballistic missile parts, is said to have occurred throughout 2012\u20132017. In 2001, Assad condemned the September 11 attacks.[217] In 2003, Assad revealed in an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper that he doubted the organization of al-Qaeda even existed. He was quoted as saying, \"Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Was it in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?\" He went on further to remark about Osama bin Laden, commenting: \"[he] cannot talk on the phone or use the Internet, but he can direct communications to the four corners of the world? This is illogical.\"[218] Assad's relationship with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has been subject to much attention. In 2014, journalist and terrorism expert Peter R. Neumann maintained, citing Syrian records captured by the U.S. military in the Iraqi border town of Sinjar and leaked State Department cables, that \"in the years that preceded the uprising, Assad and his intelligence services took the view that jihad could be nurtured and manipulated to serve the Syrian government's aims\".[219] Other leaked cables contained remarks by US general David Petraeus which stated that \"Bashar al-Asad was well aware that his brother-in-law 'Asif Shawqat, Director of Syrian Military Intelligence, had detailed knowledge of the activities of AQI facilitator Abu Ghadiya, who was using Syrian territory to bring foreign fighters and suicide bombers into Iraq\", with later cables adding that Petraeus thought that \"in time, these fighters will turn on their Syrian hosts and begin conducting attacks against Bashar al-Assad's regime itself\".[220] During the Iraq War, the Assad government was accused of training jihadis and facilitating their passage into Iraq, with these infiltration routes remaining active until the Syrian Civil War; US General Jack Keane has stated that \"Al Qaeda fighters who are back in Syria, I am confident, they are relying on much they learned in moving through Syria into Iraq for more than five years when they were waging war against the U.S. and Iraq Security Assistance Force\".[221] Iraqi president Nouri al-Maliki threatened Assad with an international tribunal over the matter, and ultimately lead to the 2008 Abu Kamal raid, and United States airstrikes within Syria during the Iraq War.[222] During the Syrian Civil War, multiple opposition and anti-Assad parties in the conflict accused Assad of collusion with ISIS; several sources have claimed that ISIS prisoners were strategically released from Syrian prisons at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011.[223] It has also been reported that the Syrian government has bought oil directly from ISIL.[224] A businessman operating in both government and ISIL-controlled territory has claimed that \"out of necessity\" the Assad government has \"had dealings with ISIS.\"[225] At its height, ISIS was making $40 million a month from the sale of oil, with spreadsheets and accounts kept by oil boss Abu Sayyaf suggesting the majority of the oil was sold to the Syrian government.[226][224] In 2014, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry claimed that the Assad government has tactically avoided ISIS forces in order to weaken \"moderate opposition\" such as the Free Syrian Army,[227] as well as \"purposely ceding some territory to them [ISIS] in order to make them more of a problem so he can make the argument that he is somehow the protector against them\".[228] A Jane's Defence Weekly database analysis claimed that only a small percentage of the Syrian government's attacks were targeted at ISIS in 2014.[229] The Syrian National Coalition has stated that the Assad government has operatives inside ISIS,[230] as has the leadership of Ahrar al-Sham.[231] ISIS members captured by the FSA have claimed that they were directed to commit attacks by Assad regime operatives.[232] Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi disputed such assertions in February 2014, arguing that \"ISIS has a record of fighting the regime on multiple fronts\", many rebel factions have engaged in oil sales to the Syrian regime because it is \"now largely dependent on Iraqi oil imports via Lebanese and Egyptian third-party intermediaries\", and while \"the regime is focusing its airstrikes [on areas] where it has some real expectations of advancing\" claims that it \"has not hit ISIS strongholds\" are \"untrue\". He concluded: \"Attempting to prove an ISIS-regime conspiracy without any conclusive evidence is unhelpful, because it draws attention away from the real reasons why ISIS grew and gained such prominence: namely, rebel groups tolerated ISIS.\"[233] Similarly, Max Abrams and John Glaser stated in the Los Angeles Times in December 2017 that \"The evidence of Assad sponsoring Islamic State\u00a0... was about as strong as for Saddam Hussein sponsoring Al Qaeda.\"[234] In October 2014, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden stated that Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had \"poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Al-Assad, except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra, and al Qaeda, and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.\"[235] Mark Lyall Grant, then Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, stated at the outset of the American-led intervention in Syria that \"ISIS is a monster that the Frankenstein of Assad has largely created\".[236] French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande stated, \"Assad cannot be a partner in the fight against terrorism, he is the de facto ally of jihadists\".[237] Analyst Noah Bonsey of the International Crisis Group has suggested that ISIS are politically expedient for Assad, as \"the threat of ISIS provides a way out [for Assad] because the regime believes that over time the U.S. and other countries backing the opposition will eventually conclude that the regime is a necessary partner on the ground in confronting this jihadi threat\", while Robin Wright of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars has stated \"the outside world's decision to focus on ISIS has ironically lessened the pressure on Assad.\"[238] In May 2015, Mario Abou Zeid of the Carnegie Middle East Center claimed that the recent Hezbollah offensive \"has exposed the reality of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) in Qalamoun; that it is operated by the Syrian regime's intelligence\", after ISIS in the region engaged in probing attacks against FSA units at the outset of the fighting.[239] On 1 June 2015, the United States stated that the Assad government was \"making air-strikes in support\" of an ISIS advance on Syrian opposition positions north of Aleppo.[240] Referring to the same ISIS offensive, the president of the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) Khaled Koja accused Assad of acting \"as an air force for ISIS\",[241] with the Defence Minister of the SNC Salim Idris claiming that approximately 180 Assad-linked officers were serving in ISIS and coordinating the group's attacks with the Syrian Arab Army.[242] Christopher Kozak of the Institute for the Study of War claims that \"Assad sees the defeat of ISIS in the long term and prioritizes in the more short-and medium-term, trying to cripple the more mainline Syrian opposition [...] ISIS is a threat that lots of people can rally around and even if the regime trades \u2026 territory that was in rebel hands over to ISIS control, that weakens the opposition, which has more legitimacy [than ISIS]\".[243] In 2015, the al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate,[244] issued a bounty worth millions of dollars for the killing of Assad.[245] The head of the al-Nusra Front, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, said he would pay \"three million euros ($3.4 million) for anyone who can kill Bashar al-Assad and end his story\".[246] In 2015, Assad's main regional opponents, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, were openly backing the Army of Conquest, an umbrella rebel group that reportedly included the al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front and another Salafi coalition known as Ahrar al-Sham.[247][248][249] In the course of the conflict, ISIS has repeatedly massacred pro-government Alawite civilians and executed captured Syrian Alawite soldiers,[250][251] with most Alawites supporting Bashar al-Assad, himself an Alawite. ISIS, al-Nusra Front and affiliated jihadist groups reportedly took the lead in an offensive on Alawite villages in Latakia Governorate of Syria in August 2013.[250][252] Assad condemned the November 2015 Paris attacks, but added that France's support for Syrian rebel groups had contributed to the spread of terrorism, and rejected sharing intelligence on terrorist threats with French authorities unless France altered its foreign policy on Syria.[253][254] During the Civil War, the Druze in Syria have primarily sought to remain neutral, \"seeking to stay out of the conflict\", while according to others over half support the Assad government despite its relative weakness in Druze areas.[255] The \"Sheikhs of Dignity\" movement, which had sought to remain neutral and to defend Druze areas,[256] blamed the government after its leader Sheikh Wahid al-Balous was assassinated and led to large scale protests which left six government security personnel dead.[257] It has been reported at various stages of the Syrian Civil War that other religious minorities such as the Alawites and Christians in Syria favour the Assad government because of its secularism,[258][259] however opposition exists among Assyrian Christians who have claimed that the Assad government seeks to use them as \"puppets\" and deny their distinct ethnicity, which is non-Arab.[260] Syria's Alawite community is widely written about in the foreign media as Bashar al-Assad's core support base and is said to dominate the government's security apparatus,[261][262] yet in April 2016 a BBC report claimed that Alawite leaders released a document seeking to distance themselves from Assad.[263] In 2014, the Christian Syriac Military Council, the largest Christian organization in Syria, allied with the Free Syrian Army opposed to Assad,[264] joining other Syrian Christian militias such as the Sutoro who had joined the Syrian opposition against the Assad government.[265] In June 2014, Assad won a disputed presidential election held in government-controlled areas (and ignored in opposition-held areas[266] and Kurdish areas governed by the Democratic Union Party[267]) with 88.7% of the vote. Turnout was estimated to be 73.42% of eligible voters, including those in rebel-controlled areas.[268] Individuals interviewed in a \"Sunni-dominated, middle-class neighborhood of central Damascus\" said there was significant support for Assad among the Sunnis in Syria.[269] Attempts to hold an election under the circumstances of an ongoing civil war were criticised by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.[270] Assad's support from the right-wing has mostly been from the far-right, both before and during the Syrian Civil War. David Duke hosted a televised speech on Syrian national television in 2005.[271] Georgy Shchokin was invited to Syria in 2006 by the Syrian foreign minister and awarded a medal by the Ba'ath party, while Shchokin's institution the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management awarded Assad an honorary doctorate.[272] In 2014, the Simon Wiesenthal Center claimed that Bashar al-Assad had sheltered Alois Brunner in Syria, and alleged that Brunner advised the Assad government on purging Syria's Jewish community.[273][274] The National Front in France has been a prominent supporter of Assad since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War,[275] as has the former leader of the Third Way.[271] In Italy, the parties New Front and CasaPound have both been supportive of Assad, with the New Front putting up pro-Assad posters and the party's leader praising Assad's commitment to the ideology of Arab nationalism in 2013,[276] while CasaPound has also issued statements of support for Assad.[277] Syrian Social Nationalist Party representative Ouday Ramadan has worked in Italy to organize support movements for Assad.[278] Other political parties expressing support for Assad include the National Democratic Party of Germany,[279] the National Revival of Poland,[271] the Freedom Party of Austria,[280] the Bulgarian Ataka party,[281] the Hungarian Jobbik party,[282] the Serbian Radical Party,[283] the Portuguese National Renovator Party,[284] as well as the Spanish Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS[285] and Authentic Falange parties.[286] The Greek neo-Nazi political party Golden Dawn has spoken out in favour of Assad,[287] and the Strasserist group Black Lily has claimed to have sent mercenaries to Syria to fight alongside the Syrian army.[288] Nick Griffin, the former leader of the British National Party, was chosen by the Assad government to represent the UK as an ambassador and at government-held conferences; Griffin has been an official guest of the Syrian government three times since the beginning of the Civil War.[289] The European Solidarity Front for Syria, representing several far-right political groups from across Europe, has had their delegations received by the Syrian national parliament, with one delegation being met by Syrian Head of Parliament Mohammad Jihad al-Laham, Prime Minister Wael Nader al-Halqi and Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad.[278] In March 2015, Assad met with Filip Dewinter of the Belgian party Vlaams Belang.[290] In 2016, Assad met with a French delegation,[291] which included former leader of the youth movement of the National Front Julien Rochedy\u00a0[fr].[292] Left-wing support for Assad has been split since the start of the Syrian Civil War;[293] the Assad government has been accused of cynically manipulating sectarian identity and anti-imperialism to continue its worst activities.[294] During a visit to the University of Damascus in November 2005, British politician George Galloway said of Assad, and of the country he leads: \"For me he is the last Arab ruler, and Syria is the last Arab country. It is the fortress of the remaining dignity of the Arabs,\"[295] and a \"breath of fresh air\".[296] Hadash has expressed support for the Government of Bashar al-Assad.[297] Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea and Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong-un has expressed support for Assad in face of a growing civil war.[298] The leader of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and President of Venezuela Nicol\u00e1s Maduro reiterated his full support for the Syrian people in their struggle for peace and reaffirms its strong condemnation of \"the destabilizing actions that are still in Syria, with encouragement from members of NATO\".[299] The leader of the National Liberation Front and President of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has sent a cable of congratulations to Assad, on the occasion of winning his presidential elections.[300] The leader of Guyana's People's Progressive Party and President of Guyana, Donald Ramotar, said that Assad's win in the presidential election is a great victory for Syria.[301] The leader of the African National Congress and President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, congratulated Assad on winning the presidential elections.[302] The leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, has said that Assad's victory (in the presidential elections) is an important step to \"attain peace in Syria and a clear cut evidence that the Syrian people trust their president as a national leader and support his policies which aim at maintaining Syria's sovereignty and unity\".[303] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine supports the Assad government.[304][305] The leader of Fatah and President of the State of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, has said that electing President Assad means \"preserving Syria's unity and sovereignty and that it will help end the crisis and confront terrorism, wishing prosperity and safety to Syria\".[306][307][308] President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko has expressed confidence that Syria will eliminate the current crisis and continue under the leadership of President al-Assad \"the fight against terrorism and foreign interference in its internal affairs\".[309] In order to promote their image and media-portrayal overseas, Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad hired United States- and United Kingdom-based PR firms and consultants.[310] In particular, these secured photoshoots for Asma al-Assad with fashion and celebrity magazines, including Vogue's March 2011 \"A Rose in the Desert\".[311][312] These firms included Bell Pottinger and Brown Lloyd James, with the latter being paid $5,000 a month for their services.[310][313] At the outset of the Syrian Civil War, Syrian government networks were hacked by the group Anonymous, revealing that an ex-Al Jazeera journalist had been hired to advise Assad on how to manipulate the public opinion of the United States. Among the advice was the suggestion to compare the popular uprising against the regime to the Occupy Wall Street protests.[314] In a separate e-mail leak several months later by the Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution, which were published by The Guardian, it was revealed that Assad's consultants had coordinated with an Iranian government media advisor.[315] In March 2015, an expanded version of the aforementioned leaks was handed to the Lebanese NOW News website and published the following month.[316] After the Syrian Civil War began, the Assads started a social media campaign which included building a presence on Facebook, YouTube, and most notably Instagram.[313] A Twitter account for Assad was reportedly activated, however it remained unverified.[317] This resulted in much criticism, and was described by The Atlantic Wire as \"a propaganda campaign that ultimately has made the [Assad] family look worse\".[318] The Assad government has also allegedly arrested activists for creating Facebook groups that the government disapproved of,[96] and has appealed directly to Twitter to remove accounts it disliked.[319] The social media campaign, as well as the previously leaked e-mails, led to comparisons with Hannah Arendt's A Report on the Banality of Evil by The Guardian, The New York Times and the Financial Times.[320][321][322] In October 2014, 27,000 photographs depicting torture committed by the Assad government were put on display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.[323][324] Lawyers were hired to write a report on the images by the British law firm Carter-Ruck, which in turn was funded by the Government of Qatar.[325] In November 2014, the Quilliam Foundation reported that a propaganda campaign, which they claimed had the \"full backing of Assad\", spread false reports about the deaths of Western-born jihadists in order to deflect attention from the government's alleged war crimes. Using a picture of a Chechen fighter from the Second Chechen War, pro-Assad media reports disseminated to Western media outlets, leading them to publish a false story regarding the death of a non-existent British jihadist.[326] In 2015, Russia intervened in the Syrian Civil War in support of Assad, and on 21 October 2015, Assad flew to Moscow and met with Russian president Vladimir Putin, who said regarding the civil war: \"this decision can be made only by the Syrian people. Syria is a friendly country. And we are ready to support it not only militarily but politically as well.\".[327] Assad speaks fluent English and basic conversational French, having studied at the Franco-Arab al-Hurriyah school in Damascus.[328] In December 2000, Assad married Asma al-Assad (n\u00e9e Akhras), a British citizen of Syrian origin from Acton, London.[329][330] In 2001, Asma gave birth to their first child, a son named Hafez after the child's grandfather Hafez al-Assad. Their daughter Zein was born in 2003, followed by their second son Karim in 2004.[33] Assad's sister, Bushra al-Assad, and mother, Anisa Makhlouf, left Syria in 2012 and 2013, respectively, to live in the United Arab Emirates.[33] Makhlouf died in Damascus in 2016.[331] Revoked and returned distinctions are marked with red.

In addition, he is commander-in-chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and Regional Secretary of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party's branch in Syria. His father, Hafez al-Assad, was also President of Syria from 1971 to 2000.\nBorn and raised in Damascus, Assad graduated from the medical school of Damascus University in 1988 and began to work as a doctor in the Syrian Army. Four years later, he attended postgraduate studies at the Western Eye Hospital in London, specialising in ophthalmology. In 1994, after his elder brother Bassel died in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as heir apparent. He entered the military academy, taking charge of the Syrian military presence in Lebanon in 1998.\nPolitical scientists have characterized the Assad family's rule of Syria as a personalist dictatorship.[2][3][4][5][6] On 10 July 2000, Assad was elected as President, succeeding his father, who died in office a month prior. In the 2000 and subsequent 2007 election, he received 99.7% and 97.6% support, respectively, in non-competitive, non-democratic elections.[7][8][9] On 16 July 2014, Assad was sworn in for another seven-year term after winning another non-competitive, non-democratic election.[10][11][12] The election was held only in areas controlled by the Syrian government during the country's ongoing civil war and was criticized by the UN, the Syrian opposition and its Western countries,[13][14] while Syria's allies stated that the election was \"free and fair\".[15][16][17] The Assad government describes itself as secular,[18] while some political scientists have claimed that the government exploits sectarian tensions in the country and relies upon the Alawite minority to remain in power.[19][20]\nPreviously seen by many states as a potential reformer, the United States, the European Union and the majority of the Arab League called for Assad's resignation from the presidency after he ordered crackdowns and military sieges on Arab Spring protesters, which led to the Syrian Civil War.[21][22] During the Syrian Civil War, an inquiry by the United Nations reported finding evidence which implicated Assad in war crimes.[23] The UN and international chemical weapons inspectors also concluded that the Assad regime has been behind chemical weapons attacks against civilians.[24] In June 2014, Assad was included in a list of war crimes indictments of government officials and rebels handed to the International Criminal Court.[25] Assad has rejected allegations of war crimes and criticised the American-led intervention in Syria for attempting regime change.[26][27]\nBashar Hafez al-Assad was born in Damascus on 11 September 1965, the second oldest son of Anisa Makhlouf and Hafez al-Assad.[28] Al-Assad in Arabic means \"the Lion\". Assad's paternal grandfather, Ali Sulayman al-Assad, had managed to change his status from peasant to minor notable and, to reflect this, in 1927 he had changed the family name from Wahsh (meaning \"Savage\") to Al-Assad.[29]\nAssad's father, Hafez, was born to an impoverished rural family of Alawite background and rose through the Ba'ath Party ranks to take control of the Syrian branch of the Party in the 1970 Corrective Revolution, culminating in his rise to the Syrian presidency.[30] Hafez promoted his supporters within the Ba'ath Party, many of whom were also of Alawite background.[28][31] After the revolution, Alawite strongmen were installed while Sunnis, Druzes, and Ismailis were removed from the army and Ba'ath party.[32]\nThe younger Assad had five siblings, three of whom are deceased. A sister named Bushra died in infancy.[33] Assad's youngest brother, Majd, was not a public figure and little is known about him other than he was intellectually disabled,[34] and died in 2009 after a \"long illness\".[35]\nUnlike his brothers Bassel and Maher, and second sister, also named Bushra, Bashar was quiet, reserved and lacked interest in politics or the military.[36][34][37] The Assad children reportedly rarely saw their father,[38] and Bashar later stated that he only entered his father's office once while he was president.[39] He was described as \"soft-spoken\",[40] and according to a university friend, he was timid, avoided eye contact and speaking in a low voice.[41]\nAssad received his primary and secondary education in the Arab-French al-Hurriya School in Damascus.[36] In 1982, he graduated from high school and then studied medicine at Damascus University.[42]\nIn 1988, Assad graduated from medical school and began working as an army doctor at the Tishrin Military Hospital on the outskirts of Damascus.[43][44] Four years later, he settled in London to start postgraduate training in ophthalmology at the Western Eye Hospital.[45] He was described as a \"geeky I.T. guy\" during his time in London.[46] Bashar had few political aspirations,[47] and his father had been grooming Bashar's older brother Bassel as the future president.[48] However, Bassel died in a car accident in 1994 and Bashar was recalled to the Syrian Army shortly thereafter.\nSoon after the death of Bassel, Hafez al-Assad decided to make Bashar the new heir apparent.[49] Over the next six and a half years, until his death in 2000, Hafez prepared Bashar for taking over power. Preparations for a smooth transition were made on three levels. First, support was built up for Bashar in the military and security apparatus. Second, Bashar's image was established with the public. And lastly, Bashar was familiarised with the mechanisms of running the country.[50]\nTo establish his credentials in the military, Bashar entered the military academy at Homs in 1994 and was propelled through the ranks to become a colonel of the elite Syrian Republican Guard in January 1999.[43][51][52] To establish a power base for Bashar in the military, old divisional commanders were pushed into retirement, and new, young, Alawite officers with loyalties to him took their place.[53]\nIn 1998, Bashar took charge of Syria's Lebanon file, which had since the 1970s been handled by Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam, who had until then been a potential contender for president.[53] By taking charge of Syrian affairs in Lebanon, Bashar was able to push Khaddam aside and establish his own power base in Lebanon.[54] In the same year, after minor consultation with Lebanese politicians, Bashar installed Emile Lahoud, a loyal ally of his, as the President of Lebanon and pushed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri aside, by not placing his political weight behind his nomination as prime minister.[55] To further weaken the old Syrian order in Lebanon, Bashar replaced the long serving de facto Syrian High Commissioner of Lebanon, Ghazi Kanaan, with Rustum Ghazaleh.[56]\nParallel to his military career, Bashar was engaged in public affairs. He was granted wide powers and became head of the bureau to receive complaints and appeals of citizens, and led a campaign against corruption. As a result of this campaign, many of Bashar's potential rivals for president were put on trial for corruption.[43] Bashar also became the President of the Syrian Computer Society and helped to introduce the internet in Syria, which aided his image as a moderniser and reformer.[57]\n Asia portal\n History portal\nAfter the death of Hafez al-Assad on 10 June 2000, the Constitution of Syria was amended; the minimum age requirement for the presidency was lowered from 40 to 34, which was Bashar's age at the time.[58] Assad was then confirmed president on 10 July 2000, with 99.7% support for his leadership. In line with his role as President of Syria, he was also appointed the commander-in-chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and Regional Secretary of the Ba'ath Party.[57]\nImmediately after he took office, a reform movement made cautious advances during the Damascus Spring, which led to the shut down of Mezzeh prison and the declaration of a wide-ranging amnesty releasing hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood affiliated political prisoners.[59] However, security crackdowns commenced again within the year.[60][61] Many analysts stated that reform under Assad had been inhibited by the \"old guard\", members of the government loyal to his late father.[57]\nDuring the War on terror, Assad allied his country with the West. Syria was a major site of extraordinary rendition by the CIA of al-Qaeda suspects, who were interrogated in Syrian prisons.[62][63][64]\nSoon after Assad assumed power, he \"made Syria's link with Hezbollah \u2013 and its patrons in Tehran \u2013 the central component of his security doctrine\",[65] and in his foreign policy, Assad is an outspoken critic of the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.[66]\nIn 2005 Rafic Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon, was assassinated. The Christian Science Monitor reported that \"Syria was widely blamed for Hariri's murder. In the months leading to the assassination, relations between Hariri and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plummeted amid an atmosphere of threats and intimidation.\"[67] The BBC reported in December 2005 that an interim United Nations report \"implicated Syrian officials\", while \"Damascus has strongly denied involvement in the car bomb which killed Hariri in February\".[68]\nOn 27 May 2007, Assad was approved for another seven-year term in a referendum on his presidency, with 97.6% of the votes supporting his continued leadership.[69]\nMass protests in Syria began on 26 January 2011. Protesters called for political reforms and the reinstatement of civil rights, as well as an end to the state of emergency which had been in place since 1963.[70] One attempt at a \"day of rage\" was set for 4\u20135 February, though it ended uneventfully.[71] Protests on 18\u201319 March were the largest to take place in Syria for decades, and the Syrian authority responded with violence against its protesting citizens.[72]\nThe U.S. imposed limited sanctions against the Assad government in April 2011, followed by Barack Obama's executive order as of 18 May 2011 targeting Bashar Assad specifically and six other senior officials.[73][74][75] On 23 May 2011, the EU foreign ministers agreed at a meeting in Brussels to add Assad and nine other officials to a list affected by travel bans and asset freezes.[76] On 24 May 2011, Canada imposed sanctions on Syrian leaders, including Assad.[77]\nOn 20 June, in response to the demands of protesters and foreign pressure, Assad promised a national dialogue involving movement toward reform, new parliamentary elections, and greater freedoms. He also urged refugees to return home from Turkey, while assuring them amnesty and blaming all unrest on a small number of saboteurs.[78] Assad blamed the unrest on \"conspiracies\" and accused the Syrian opposition and protestors of \"fitna\", breaking with the Syrian Ba'ath Party's strict tradition of secularism.[79]\nIn July 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Assad had \"lost legitimacy\" as President.[74] On 18 August 2011, Barack Obama issued a written statement that urged Assad to \"step aside\".[80][81]\nIn August, the cartoonist Ali Farzat, a critic of Assad's government, was attacked. Relatives of the humourist told media outlets that the attackers threatened to break Farzat's bones as a warning for him to stop drawing cartoons of government officials, particularly Assad. Farzat was hospitalised with fractures in both hands and blunt force trauma to the head.[82][83]\nSince October 2011, Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, repeatedly vetoed Western-sponsored draft resolutions in the UN Security Council that would have left open the possibility of UN sanctions, or even military intervention, against the Assad government.[84][85][86]\nBy the end of January 2012, it was reported by Reuters that over 5,000 civilians and protesters (including armed militants) had been killed by the Syrian army, security agents and militia (Shabiha), while 1,100 people had been killed by \"terrorist armed forces\".[87]\nOn 10 January 2012, Assad gave a speech in which he maintained the uprising was engineered by foreign countries and proclaimed that \"victory [was] near\". He also said that the Arab League, by suspending Syria, revealed that it was no longer Arab. However, Assad also said the country would not \"close doors\" to an Arab-brokered solution if \"national sovereignty\" was respected. He also said a referendum on a new constitution could be held in March.[88]\nOn 27 February 2012, Syria claimed that a proposal that a new constitution be drafted received 90% support during the relevant referendum. The referendum introduced a fourteen-year cumulative term limit for the president of Syria. The referendum was pronounced meaningless by foreign nations including the U.S. and Turkey; the European Union announced fresh sanctions against key regime figures.[89] In July 2012, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denounced Western powers for what he said amounted to blackmail thus provoking a civil war in Syria.[90]\nOn 15 July 2012, the International Committee of the Red Cross declared Syria to be in a state of civil war,[91] as the nationwide death toll for all sides was reported to have neared 20,000.[92]\nOn 6 January 2013, Assad, in his first major speech since June, said that the conflict in his country was due to \"enemies\" outside of Syria who would \"go to Hell\" and that they would \"be taught a lesson\". However, he said that he was still open to a political solution saying that failed attempts at a solution \"does not mean we are not interested in a political solution.\"[93][94]\nAfter the fall of four military bases in September 2014,[95] which were the last government footholds in the Raqqa Governorate, Assad received significant criticism from his Alawite base of support.[96] This included remarks made by Douraid al-Assad, cousin of Bashar al-Assad, demanding the resignation of the Syrian Defence Minister, Fahd Jassem al-Freij, following the massacre by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of hundreds of government troops captured after the ISIL victory at Tabqa Airbase.[97] This was shortly followed by Alawite protests in Homs demanding the resignation of the governor,[98] and the dismissal of Assad's cousin Hafez Makhlouf from his security position leading to his subsequent exile to Belarus.[99] Growing resentment towards Assad among Alawites was fuelled by the disproportionate number of soldiers killed in fighting hailing from Alawite areas,[100] a sense that the Assad regime has abandoned them,[101] as well as the failing economic situation.[102] Figures close to Assad began voicing concerns regarding the likelihood of its survival, with one saying in late 2014; \"I don't see the current situation as sustainable ... I think Damascus will collapse at some point.\"[95]\nIn 2015, several members of the Assad family died in Latakia under unclear circumstances.[103] On 14 March, an influential cousin of Assad and founder of the shabiha, Mohammed Toufic al-Assad, was assassinated with five bullets to the head in a dispute over influence in Qardaha\u2014the ancestral home of the Assad family.[104] In April 2015, Assad ordered the arrest of his cousin Munther al-Assad in Alzirah, Latakia.[105] It remains unclear whether the arrest was due to actual crimes.[106]\nAfter a string of government defeats in northern and southern Syria, analysts noted growing government instability coupled with continued waning support for the Assad government among its core Alawite base of support,[107] and that there were increasing reports of Assad relatives, Alawites, and businessmen fleeing Damascus for Latakia and foreign countries.[108][109] Intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk was placed under house arrest sometime in April and stood accused of plotting with Assad's exiled uncle Rifaat al-Assad to replace Bashar as president.[110] Further high-profile deaths included the commanders of the Fourth Armoured Division, the Belli military airbase, the army's special forces and of the First Armoured Division, with an errant air strike during the Palmyra offensive killing two officers who were reportedly related to Assad.[111]\nIn early September 2015, against the backdrop of reports that Russia was deploying troops in Syria ready for combat, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that while such talk was \"premature\", Russia was \"already providing Syria with sufficiently serious help: with both equipment and training soldiers, with our weapons\".[112][113] Shortly after the start of direct military intervention by Russia on 30 September 2015 at the formal request of the Syrian government, Putin stated the military operation had been thoroughly prepared in advance and defined Russia's goal in Syria as \"stabilising the legitimate power in Syria and creating the conditions for political compromise\".[114]\nIn November 2015, Assad reiterated that a diplomatic process to bring the country's civil war to an end could not begin while it was occupied by \"terrorists\", although it was considered by BBC News to be unclear whether he meant only ISIL or Western-supported rebels as well.[115] On 22 November, Assad said that within two months of its air campaign Russia had achieved more in its fight against ISIL than the U.S.-led coalition had achieved in a year.[116] In an interview with \u010cesk\u00e1 televize on 1 December, he said that the leaders who demanded his resignation were of no interest to him, as nobody takes them seriously because they are \"shallow\" and controlled by the U.S.[117][118] At the end of December 2015, senior U.S. officials privately admitted that Russia had achieved its central goal of stabilising Syria and, with the costs relatively low, could sustain the operation at this level for years to come.[119]\nIn January 2016, Putin stated that Russia was supporting Assad's forces and was ready to back anti-Assad rebels as long as they were fighting ISIL.[120] On 11 January 2016, the senior Russian defence ministry official said that the \"Russian air force was striking in support of eleven groups of democratic opposition that number over seven thousand people.\"[121]\nOn 22 January 2016, the Financial Times, citing anonymous \"senior western intelligence officials\", claimed that Russian general Igor Sergun, the director of GRU, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, had shortly before his sudden death on 3 January 2016 been sent to Damascus with a message from Vladimir Putin asking that President Assad step aside.[122] The Financial Times' report was promptly denied by Putin's spokesman.[123]\nIt was reported in December 2016 that Assad's forces had retaken half of rebel-held Aleppo, ending a 6-year stalemate in the city.[124][125] On 15 December, as it was reported government forces were on the brink of retaking all of Aleppo\u2014a \"turning point\" in the Civil War, Assad celebrated the liberation of the city, and stated, \"History is being written by every Syrian citizen.\"[126]\nAfter the election of Donald Trump, the priority of the United States concerning Assad was unlike the priority of the Obama administration, and in March 2017 United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley stated the U.S. was no longer focused on \"getting Assad out\",[127] but this position changed in the wake of the 2017 Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[128] Following the missile strikes on a Syrian airbase on the orders of President Trump, Assad's spokesperson described the United States' behaviour as \"unjust and arrogant aggression\" and stated that the missile strikes \"do not change the deep policies\" of the Syrian government.[129] President Assad also told the Agence France-Presse that Syria's military had given up all its chemical weapons in 2013, and would not have used them if they still retained any, and stated that the chemical attack was a \"100 percent fabrication\" used to justify a U.S. airstrike.[130] In June 2017, Russian President Putin said \"Assad didn't use the [chemical weapons]\" and that the chemical attack was \"done by people who wanted to blame him for that.\"[131] United Nations and international chemical weapons inspectors found the attack was the work of the Assad regime.[24]\nOn 7 November 2017, the Syrian government announced that it had signed the Paris Climate Agreement.[132]\nAccording to ABC News, as a result of the Syrian Civil War, \"government-controlled Syria is truncated in size, battered and impoverished\".[133] Economic sanctions (the Syria Accountability Act) were applied long before the Syrian Civil War by the United States and were joined by the European Union at the outbreak of the civil war, causing disintegration of the Syrian economy.[134] These sanctions were reinforced in October 2014 by the EU and U.S.[135][136] Industry in parts of the country that are still held by the government is heavily state-controlled, with economic liberalisation being reversed during the current conflict.[137] The London School of Economics has stated that as a result of the Syrian Civil War, a war economy has developed in Syria.[138] A 2014 European Council on Foreign Relations report also stated that a war economy has formed:\nThree years into a conflict that is estimated to have killed at least 140,000 people from both sides, much of the Syrian economy lies in ruins. As the violence has expanded and sanctions have been imposed, assets and infrastructure have been destroyed, economic output has fallen, and investors have fled the country. Unemployment now exceeds 50 percent and half of the population lives below the poverty line ... against this backdrop, a war economy is emerging that is creating significant new economic networks and business activities that feed off the violence, chaos, and lawlessness gripping the country. This war economy \u2013 to which Western sanctions have inadvertently contributed \u2013 is creating incentives for some Syrians to prolong the conflict and making it harder to end it.[139]\nA United Nations commissioned report by the Syrian Centre for Policy Research states that two-thirds of the Syrian population now lives in \"extreme poverty\".[140] Unemployment stands at 50 percent.[141] In October 2014, a $50 million mall opened in Tartus which provoked criticism from government supporters and was seen as part of an Assad government policy of attempting to project a sense of normalcy throughout the civil war.[142] A government policy to give preference to families of slain soldiers for government jobs was cancelled after it caused an uproar[100] while rising accusations of corruption caused protests.[102] In December 2014, the EU banned sales of jet fuel to the Assad government, forcing the government to buy more expensive uninsured jet fuel shipments in the future.[143]\nA 2007 law required internet caf\u00e9s to record all the comments users post on chat forums.[144] Websites such as Arabic Wikipedia, YouTube, and Facebook were blocked intermittently between 2008 and February 2011.[145][146][147]\nHuman Rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have detailed how the Assad government's secret police allegedly tortured, imprisoned, and killed political opponents, and those who speak out against the government.[148][149] In addition, some 600 Lebanese political prisoners are thought to be held in government prisons since the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, with some held for as long as over 30 years.[150] Since 2006, the Assad government has expanded the use of travel bans against political dissidents.[151] In an interview with ABC News in 2007, Assad stated: \"We don't have such [things as] political prisoners,\" though The New York Times reported the arrest of 30 Syrian political dissidents who were organising a joint opposition front in December 2007, with 3 members of this group considered to be opposition leaders being remanded in custody.[152]\nIn 2010, Syria banned face veils at universities.[153][154] Following the Syrian uprising in 2011, Assad partially relaxed the veil ban.[155]\nForeign Policy magazine released an editorial on Assad's position in the wake of the 2011 protests:[156]\nDuring its decades of rule... the Assad family developed a strong political safety net by firmly integrating the military into the government. In 1970, Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, seized power after rising through the ranks of the Syrian armed forces, during which time he established a network of loyal Alawites by installing them in key posts. In fact, the military, ruling elite, and ruthless secret police are so intertwined that it is now impossible to separate the Assad government from the security establishment.... So... the government and its loyal forces have been able to deter all but the most resolute and fearless oppositional activists. In this respect, the situation in Syria is to a certain degree comparable to Saddam Hussein's strong Sunni minority rule in Iraq.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that at least 10 European citizens were tortured by the Assad government while detained during the Syrian Civil War, potentially leaving Assad open to prosecution by individual European countries for war crimes.[157] Stephen Rapp, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, has argued that the crimes allegedly committed by Assad are the worst seen since those of Nazi Germany.[158] In March 2015, Rapp further stated that the case against Assad is \"much better\" than those against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 of Serbia or Charles Taylor of Liberia, both of whom were indicted by international tribunals.[159]\nIn a February 2015 interview with the BBC, Assad described accusations that the Syrian Arab Air Force used barrel bombs as \"childish\", stating that his forces have never used these types of \"barrel\" bombs and responded with a joke about not using \"cooking pots\" either.[160] The BBC Middle East editor conducting the interview, Jeremy Bowen, later described Assad's statement regarding barrel bombs as \"patently not true\".[161][162]\nNadim Shehadi, the director of The Fares Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies, stated that \"In the early 1990s, Saddam Hussein was massacring his people and we were worried about the weapons inspectors,\" and claimed that \"Assad did that too. He kept us busy with chemical weapons when he massacred his people.\"[163][164]\nIn September 2015, France began an inquiry into Assad for crimes against humanity, with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius stating \"Faced with these crimes that offend the human conscience, this bureaucracy of horror, faced with this denial of the values of humanity, it is our responsibility to act against the impunity of the killers\".[165]\nIn February 2016, head of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, Paulo Pinheiro, told reporters: \"The mass scale of deaths of detainees suggests that the government of Syria is responsible for acts that amount to extermination as a crime against humanity.\" The UN Commission reported finding \"unimaginable abuses\", including women and children as young as seven perishing while being held by Syrian authorities. The report also stated: \"There are reasonable grounds to believe that high-ranking officers\u2014including the heads of branches and directorates\u2014commanding these detention facilities, those in charge of the military police, as well as their civilian superiors, knew of the vast number of deaths occurring in detention facilities ... yet did not take action to prevent abuse, investigate allegations or prosecute those responsible\".[166]\nIn March 2016, the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs led by New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith called on the Obama administration to create a war crimes tribunal to investigate and prosecute violations \"whether committed by the officials of the Government of Syria or other parties to the civil war\".[167]\nIn April 2017, there was a sarin chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people. The attack prompted US President Donald Trump to order the US military to launch 59 missiles at a Syrian airbase.[168] Several months later, a joint report from the United Nations and international chemical weapons inspectors found the attack was the work of the Assad regime.[24]\nIn April 2018, an alleged chemical attack occurred in Douma, prompting the U.S. and its and allies to accuse Assad of violating international laws and initiating the 2018 bombing of Damascus and Homs. Both Syria and Russia have refuted the involvement of the Syrian government at this time.[169][170]\nIn June 2018, Germany's chief prosecutor issued an international arrest warrant for one of Assad's most senior military officials, Jamil Hassan.[171] Hassan is the head of Syria's powerful Air Force Intelligence Directorate. Detention centers run by Air Force Intelligence are among the most notorious in Syria, and thousands are believed to have died because of torture or neglect. Charges filed against Hassan claim he had command responsibility over the facilities and therefore knew of the abuse. The move against Hassan marked an important milestone of prosecutors trying to bring senior members of Assad's inner circle to trial for war crimes.\nIn June 2019, United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that the United States \u201cwill respond quickly and appropriately,\u201d if the regime uses chemical weapons again.  He added that Bashar al-Assad has done more than any other to destabilize the region by \"murdering his own people\" and that both Russia and the Syrian regime have shown no concern for the suffering of the Syrian people creating one of the \"worst humanitarian tragedies in history\".[172]\nAssad opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq despite a long-standing animosity between the Syrian and Iraqi governments. Assad used Syria's seat in one of the rotating positions on the United Nations Security Council to try to prevent the invasion of Iraq.[173]\nAccording to veteran U.S intelligence officer Malcolm Nance, the Syrian government had developed deep relations with former Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri. Despite the historical differences between the two Ba'ath factions, al-Douri reportedly urged Saddam to open oil pipelines with Syria, building a financial relationship with the Assad family. After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, al-Douri allegedly fled to Damascus where he organised the National Command of the Islamic Resistance which co-ordinated major combat operations during the Iraqi insurgency.[174][175] In 2009, General David Petraeus, who was at the time heading the United States Central Command, told reporters from Al Arabiya that al-Douri was residing in Syria.[176]\nThe U.S commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, George W. Casey Jr., accused Assad of providing funding, logistics, and training to insurgents in Iraq to launch attacks against U.S. and allied forces occupying Iraq.[177] Iraqi leaders such as former national security advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie and former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have accused Assad of harbouring and supporting Iraqi militants.[178][179]\nDiplomatic relations with Egypt were re-established in 2005 under his rule. In 1978, his father Hafez al-Assad severed diplomatic relations with the country after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat signed a peace treaty with Israel in the Camp David Accords.[citation needed] However, at the outset of the Arab Spring, Syrian state media focused primarily upon Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, demonising him as pro-U.S. and comparing him unfavourably with Assad.[180] Assad told The Wall Street Journal in this same period that he considered himself \"anti-Israel\" and \"anti-West\", and that because of these policies he was not in danger of being overthrown.[66]\nFollowing the election of Muslim Brotherhood politician Mohamed Morsi as the next Egyptian president, relations became extremely strained. The Muslim Brotherhood is a banned organisation and its membership is a capital offence in Syria. Egypt severed all relations with Syria in June 2013.[citation needed] Diplomatic relations were restored and the embassies reopened after Morsi regime was deposed just weeks later by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In July 2013, the two countries agreed to reopen the Egyptian consulate in Damascus and the Syrian consulate in Cairo.[181]\nIn late-November 2016, some Arab media outlets reported Egyptian pilots arrived in mid-November to Syria to help the Syrian government in its fight against the Islamic State and Al Nusra front.[182] This came after Sisi publicly stated he supports the Syrian military in the civil war in Syria.[183] However, several days later, Egypt officially denied it has a military presence in Syria.[184]\nAlthough Egypt has not been vocal in support for any sides of Syria's ongoing civil war, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said in 2016 that his nation's priority is \"supporting national armies\", which he said included the Syrian Armed Forces.[185] He also said regarding Egypt's stance in the conflict: \"Our stance in Egypt is to respect the will of the Syrian people, and that a political solution to the Syrian crisis is the most suitable way, and to seriously deal with terrorist groups and disarm them,\".[185] Egypt's support for a political solution was reaffirmed in February 2017. Egypt's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said that Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, \"during his meeting with UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, on Saturday confirmed Egypt\u2019s rejection of any military intervention that would violate Syrian sovereignty and undermine opportunities of the standing political solutions.\u201d[186]\nEgypt has also expressed great interest in rebuilding postwar Syria, with many Egyptian companies and businessmen discussing investment opportunities in Syria as well as participation in the reconstruction effort. Tarik al-Nabrawi, president of Egypt's Engineers Syndicate said that 2018 will witness a \u201cboom and influential role for Egyptian construction companies in Syria and to open the door for other companies \u2014 in the electricity, building material, steel, aluminum, ceramics and sanitary material fields among others \u2014 to work in the Syrian market and participate in rebuilding cities and facilities that the war has destroyed.\u201d[187] On 25 February 2018, Syrian state news reported that an Egyptian delegation composed of \"members of the Islamic and Arab Assembly for supporting Resistance and Future Pioneers movement as well as a number of figures\", including Jamal Zahran and Farouk Hassan, visited the Syrian consulate in Cairo to express solidarity with the Syrian government.[188][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nAssad argued that Syria's gradual withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, beginning in 2000, was a result of the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri and ended in May 2005.[189] According to testimony submitted to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, when talking to Rafic Hariri at the Presidential Palace in Damascus in August 2004, Assad allegedly said to him, \"I will break Lebanon over your [Hariri's] head and over Walid Jumblatt's head\" if \u00c9mile Lahoud was not allowed to remain in office despite Hariri's objections; that incident was thought to be linked to Hariri's subsequent assassination.[190] In early 2015, journalist and ad hoc Lebanese-Syrian intermediary Ali Hamade stated before the Special Tribunal for Lebanon that Rafic Hariri's attempts to reduce tensions with Syria were considered a \"mockery\" by Assad.[191]\nDespite gaining re-election in 2007, Assad's position was considered by some to have been weakened by the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon following the Cedar Revolution in 2005. There has also been pressure from the U.S. concerning claims that Syria is linked to terrorist networks, exacerbated by Syrian condemnation of the assassination of Hezbollah military leader, Imad Mughniyah, in Damascus in 2008. Interior Minister Bassam Abdul-Majeed stated that \"Syria, which condemns this cowardly terrorist act, expresses condolences to the martyr family and to the Lebanese people.\"[192]\nIn May 2015, Lebanese politician Michel Samaha was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail for his role in a terrorist bomb plot that he claimed Assad was aware of.[193]\nThe United States, the European Union, the March 14 Alliance, and France accuse Assad of providing support to militant groups active against Israel and opposition political groups. The latter category would include most political parties other than Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine.[194]\nIn a speech about the 2006 Lebanon War in August 2006, Assad said that Hezbollah had \"hoisted the banner of victory\", hailing its actions as a \"successful resistance\".[195]\nIn April 2008, Assad told a Qatari newspaper that Syria and Israel had been discussing a peace treaty for a year. This was confirmed in May 2008, by a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. As well as the treaty, the future of the Golan Heights was being discussed. Assad was quoted in The Guardian as telling the Qatari paper:\n... there would be no direct negotiations with Israel until a new US president takes office. The US was the only party qualified to sponsor any direct talks, [Assad] told the paper, but added that the Bush administration \"does not have the vision or will for the peace process. It does not have anything.\"[196]According to leaked American cables, Assad called Hamas an \"uninvited guest\" and said \"If you want me to be effective and active, I have to have a relationship with all parties. Hamas is Muslim Brotherhood, but we have to deal with the reality of their presence,\" comparing Hamas to the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood which was crushed by his father, Hafez al-Assad. He also said Hamas would disappear if peace was brought to the Middle East.[197][198]\nAssad has indicated that the peace treaty that he envisions would not be the same kind of peace treaty Israel has with Egypt, where there is a legal border crossing and open trade. In a 2006 interview with Charlie Rose, Assad said: \"There is a big difference between talking about a peace treaty and peace. A peace treaty is like a permanent ceasefire. There's no war, maybe you have an embassy, but you actually won't have trade, you won't have normal relations because people will not be sympathetic to this relation as long as they are sympathetic with the Palestinians: half a million who live in Syria and half a million in Lebanon and another few millions in other Arab countries.\"[189]\nDuring the visit of Pope John Paul II to Syria in 2001, Assad requested an apology to Muslims for the Crusades and criticised Israeli treatment of Palestinians, stating that \"territories in Lebanon, the Golan and Palestine have been occupied by those who killed the principle of equality when they claimed that God created a people distinguished above all other peoples\".[199] He also compared the suffering of Palestinians at the hands of the Israelis to the suffering endured by Jesus in Judea, and said that \"they tried to kill the principles of all religions with the same mentality in which they betrayed Jesus Christ and the same way they tried to betray and kill the Prophet Muhammad\".[200][201][202][203] Responding to accusations that his comment was antisemitic, Assad said that \"We in Syria reject the term antisemitism. ... Semites are a race and [Syrians] not only belong to this race, but are its core. Judaism, on the other hand, is a religion which can be attributed to all races.\"[204] He also stated that \"I was talking about Israelis, not Jews. ... When I say Israel carries out killings, it's the reality: Israel tortures Palestinians. I didn't speak about Jews,\" and criticised Western media outlets for misinterpreting his comments.[205]\nIn February 2011, Assad backed an initiative to restore ten synagogues in Syria, which had a Jewish community numbering 30,000 in 1947, but only 200 Jews by 2011.[206]\nAssad met with U.S. scientists and policy leaders during a science diplomacy visit in 2009, and he expressed interest in building research universities and using science and technology to promote innovation and economic growth.[207]\nIn response to Executive Order 13769 which mandated refugees from Syria be indefinitely suspended from being able to resettle in the United States, Assad appeared to defend the measure, stating \"It's against the terrorists that would infiltrate some of the immigrants to the West... I think the aim of Trump is to prevent those people from coming,\" adding that it was \"not against the Syrian people\".[208] This reaction was in contrast to other leaders of countries affected by the Executive Order who condemned it.[209]\nNorth Korea has allegedly aided Syria in developing and enhancing a ballistic missiles programme.[210][211] They also reportedly helped Syria develop a suspected nuclear reactor in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. U.S. officials claimed the reactor was probably \"not intended for peaceful purposes\", but American senior intelligence officials doubted it was meant for the production of nuclear weapons.[212] The supposed nuclear reactor was destroyed by the Israeli Air Force in 2007 during Operation Orchard.[213] Following the airstrike, Syria wrote a letter to Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon calling the incursion a \"breach of airspace of the Syrian Arab Republic\" and \"not the first time Israel has violated\" Syrian airspace.[214]\nWhile hosting an 8 March 2015 delegation from North Korea led by North Korean Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sin Hong Chol, Assad stated that Syria and North Korea were being \"targeted\" because they are \"among those few countries which enjoy real independence\".[215]\nAccording to Syrian opposition sources, North Korea has sent army units to fight on behalf of Assad in the Syrian Civil War.[216]\nIn 2018, the United Nations exposed North Korea for their facilitation of Syria's development of chemical weapons. According to a report by U.N. investigators, North Korea provided the Syrian government with acid-resistant tiles, valves, and thermometers. Additionally, DPRK missile technicians had been seen inside various Syrian chemical weapons facilities. This series of about 40 unreported shipments between North Korea and Syria, on which were the chemical weapons materials as well as prohibited ballistic missile parts, is said to have occurred throughout 2012\u20132017.\nIn 2001, Assad condemned the September 11 attacks.[217] In 2003, Assad revealed in an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper that he doubted the organization of al-Qaeda even existed. He was quoted as saying, \"Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Was it in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?\" He went on further to remark about Osama bin Laden, commenting: \"[he] cannot talk on the phone or use the Internet, but he can direct communications to the four corners of the world? This is illogical.\"[218]\nAssad's relationship with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has been subject to much attention. In 2014, journalist and terrorism expert Peter R. Neumann maintained, citing Syrian records captured by the U.S. military in the Iraqi border town of Sinjar and leaked State Department cables, that \"in the years that preceded the uprising, Assad and his intelligence services took the view that jihad could be nurtured and manipulated to serve the Syrian government's aims\".[219] Other leaked cables contained remarks by US general David Petraeus which stated that \"Bashar al-Asad was well aware that his brother-in-law 'Asif Shawqat, Director of Syrian Military Intelligence, had detailed knowledge of the activities of AQI facilitator Abu Ghadiya, who was using Syrian territory to bring foreign fighters and suicide bombers into Iraq\", with later cables adding that Petraeus thought that \"in time, these fighters will turn on their Syrian hosts and begin conducting attacks against Bashar al-Assad's regime itself\".[220]\nDuring the Iraq War, the Assad government was accused of training jihadis and facilitating their passage into Iraq, with these infiltration routes remaining active until the Syrian Civil War; US General Jack Keane has stated that \"Al Qaeda fighters who are back in Syria, I am confident, they are relying on much they learned in moving through Syria into Iraq for more than five years when they were waging war against the U.S. and Iraq Security Assistance Force\".[221] Iraqi president Nouri al-Maliki threatened Assad with an international tribunal over the matter, and ultimately lead to the 2008 Abu Kamal raid, and United States airstrikes within Syria during the Iraq War.[222]\nDuring the Syrian Civil War, multiple opposition and anti-Assad parties in the conflict accused Assad of collusion with ISIS; several sources have claimed that ISIS prisoners were strategically released from Syrian prisons at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011.[223] It has also been reported that the Syrian government has bought oil directly from ISIL.[224] A businessman operating in both government and ISIL-controlled territory has claimed that \"out of necessity\" the Assad government has \"had dealings with ISIS.\"[225]  At its height, ISIS was making $40 million a month from the sale of oil, with spreadsheets and accounts kept by oil boss Abu Sayyaf suggesting the majority of the oil was sold to the Syrian government.[226][224] In 2014, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry claimed that the Assad government has tactically avoided ISIS forces in order to weaken \"moderate opposition\" such as the Free Syrian Army,[227] as well as \"purposely ceding some territory to them [ISIS] in order to make them more of a problem so he can make the argument that he is somehow the protector against them\".[228] A Jane's Defence Weekly database analysis claimed that only a small percentage of the Syrian government's attacks were targeted at ISIS in 2014.[229] The Syrian National Coalition has stated that the Assad government has operatives inside ISIS,[230] as has the leadership of Ahrar al-Sham.[231] ISIS members captured by the FSA have claimed that they were directed to commit attacks by Assad regime operatives.[232] Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi disputed such assertions in February 2014, arguing that \"ISIS has a record of fighting the regime on multiple fronts\", many rebel factions have engaged in oil sales to the Syrian regime because it is \"now largely dependent on Iraqi oil imports via Lebanese and Egyptian third-party intermediaries\", and while \"the regime is focusing its airstrikes [on areas] where it has some real expectations of advancing\" claims that it \"has not hit ISIS strongholds\" are \"untrue\". He concluded: \"Attempting to prove an ISIS-regime conspiracy without any conclusive evidence is unhelpful, because it draws attention away from the real reasons why ISIS grew and gained such prominence: namely, rebel groups tolerated ISIS.\"[233] Similarly, Max Abrams and John Glaser stated in the Los Angeles Times in December 2017 that \"The evidence of Assad sponsoring Islamic State\u00a0... was about as strong as for Saddam Hussein sponsoring Al Qaeda.\"[234]\nIn October 2014, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden stated that Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had \"poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Al-Assad, except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra, and al Qaeda, and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.\"[235]\nMark Lyall Grant, then Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, stated at the outset of the American-led intervention in Syria that \"ISIS is a monster that the Frankenstein of Assad has largely created\".[236] French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande stated, \"Assad cannot be a partner in the fight against terrorism, he is the de facto ally of jihadists\".[237] Analyst Noah Bonsey of the International Crisis Group has suggested that ISIS are politically expedient for Assad, as \"the threat of ISIS provides a way out [for Assad] because the regime believes that over time the U.S. and other countries backing the opposition will eventually conclude that the regime is a necessary partner on the ground in confronting this jihadi threat\", while Robin Wright of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars has stated \"the outside world's decision to focus on ISIS has ironically lessened the pressure on Assad.\"[238] In May 2015, Mario Abou Zeid of the Carnegie Middle East Center claimed that the recent Hezbollah offensive \"has exposed the reality of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) in Qalamoun; that it is operated by the Syrian regime's intelligence\", after ISIS in the region engaged in probing attacks against FSA units at the outset of the fighting.[239]\nOn 1 June 2015, the United States stated that the Assad government was \"making air-strikes in support\" of an ISIS advance on Syrian opposition positions north of Aleppo.[240] Referring to the same ISIS offensive, the president of the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) Khaled Koja accused Assad of acting \"as an air force for ISIS\",[241] with the Defence Minister of the SNC Salim Idris claiming that approximately 180 Assad-linked officers were serving in ISIS and coordinating the group's attacks with the Syrian Arab Army.[242] Christopher Kozak of the Institute for the Study of War claims that \"Assad sees the defeat of ISIS in the long term and prioritizes in the more short-and medium-term, trying to cripple the more mainline Syrian opposition [...] ISIS is a threat that lots of people can rally around and even if the regime trades \u2026 territory that was in rebel hands over to ISIS control, that weakens the opposition, which has more legitimacy [than ISIS]\".[243]\nIn 2015, the al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate,[244] issued a bounty worth millions of dollars for the killing of Assad.[245] The head of the al-Nusra Front, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, said he would pay \"three million euros ($3.4 million) for anyone who can kill Bashar al-Assad and end his story\".[246] In 2015, Assad's main regional opponents, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, were openly backing the Army of Conquest, an umbrella rebel group that reportedly included the al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front and another Salafi coalition known as Ahrar al-Sham.[247][248][249] In the course of the conflict, ISIS has repeatedly massacred pro-government Alawite civilians and executed captured Syrian Alawite soldiers,[250][251] with most Alawites supporting Bashar al-Assad, himself an Alawite. ISIS, al-Nusra Front and affiliated jihadist groups reportedly took the lead in an offensive on Alawite villages in Latakia Governorate of Syria in August 2013.[250][252]\nAssad condemned the November 2015 Paris attacks, but added that France's support for Syrian rebel groups had contributed to the spread of terrorism, and rejected sharing intelligence on terrorist threats with French authorities unless France altered its foreign policy on Syria.[253][254]\nDuring the Civil War, the Druze in Syria have primarily sought to remain neutral, \"seeking to stay out of the conflict\", while according to others over half support the Assad government despite its relative weakness in Druze areas.[255] The \"Sheikhs of Dignity\" movement, which had sought to remain neutral and to defend Druze areas,[256] blamed the government after its leader Sheikh Wahid al-Balous was assassinated and led to large scale protests which left six government security personnel dead.[257]\nIt has been reported at various stages of the Syrian Civil War that other religious minorities such as the Alawites and Christians in Syria favour the Assad government because of its secularism,[258][259] however opposition exists among Assyrian Christians who have claimed that the Assad government seeks to use them as \"puppets\" and deny their distinct ethnicity, which is non-Arab.[260] Syria's Alawite community is widely written about in the foreign media as Bashar al-Assad's core support base and is said to dominate the government's security apparatus,[261][262] yet in April 2016 a BBC report claimed that Alawite leaders released a document seeking to distance themselves from Assad.[263]\nIn 2014, the Christian Syriac Military Council, the largest Christian organization in Syria, allied with the Free Syrian Army opposed to Assad,[264] joining other Syrian Christian militias such as the Sutoro who had joined the Syrian opposition against the Assad government.[265]\nIn June 2014, Assad won a disputed presidential election held in government-controlled areas (and ignored in opposition-held areas[266] and Kurdish areas governed by the Democratic Union Party[267]) with 88.7% of the vote.  Turnout was estimated to be 73.42% of eligible voters, including those in rebel-controlled areas.[268] Individuals interviewed in a \"Sunni-dominated, middle-class neighborhood of central Damascus\" said there was significant support for Assad among the Sunnis in Syria.[269] Attempts to hold an election under the circumstances of an ongoing civil war were criticised by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.[270]\nAssad's support from the right-wing has mostly been from the far-right, both before and during the Syrian Civil War. David Duke hosted a televised speech on Syrian national television in 2005.[271] Georgy Shchokin was invited to Syria in 2006 by the Syrian foreign minister and awarded a medal by the Ba'ath party, while Shchokin's institution the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management awarded Assad an honorary doctorate.[272] In 2014, the Simon Wiesenthal Center claimed that Bashar al-Assad had sheltered Alois Brunner in Syria, and alleged that Brunner advised the Assad government on purging Syria's Jewish community.[273][274]\nThe National Front in France has been a prominent supporter of Assad since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War,[275] as has the former leader of the Third Way.[271] In Italy, the parties New Front and CasaPound have both been supportive of Assad, with the New Front putting up pro-Assad posters and the party's leader praising Assad's commitment to the ideology of Arab nationalism in 2013,[276] while CasaPound has also issued statements of support for Assad.[277] Syrian Social Nationalist Party representative Ouday Ramadan has worked in Italy to organize support movements for Assad.[278] Other political parties expressing support for Assad include the National Democratic Party of Germany,[279] the National Revival of Poland,[271] the Freedom Party of Austria,[280] the Bulgarian Ataka party,[281] the Hungarian Jobbik party,[282] the Serbian Radical Party,[283] the Portuguese National Renovator Party,[284] as well as the Spanish Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS[285] and Authentic Falange parties.[286] The Greek neo-Nazi political party Golden Dawn has spoken out in favour of Assad,[287] and the Strasserist group Black Lily has claimed to have sent mercenaries to Syria to fight alongside the Syrian army.[288]\nNick Griffin, the former leader of the British National Party, was chosen by the Assad government to represent the UK as an ambassador and at government-held conferences; Griffin has been an official guest of the Syrian government three times since the beginning of the Civil War.[289] The European Solidarity Front for Syria, representing several far-right political groups from across Europe, has had their delegations received by the Syrian national parliament, with one delegation being met by Syrian Head of Parliament Mohammad Jihad al-Laham, Prime Minister Wael Nader al-Halqi and Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad.[278] In March 2015, Assad met with Filip Dewinter of the Belgian party Vlaams Belang.[290] In 2016, Assad met with a French delegation,[291] which included former leader of the youth movement of the National Front Julien Rochedy\u00a0[fr].[292]\nLeft-wing support for Assad has been split since the start of the Syrian Civil War;[293] the Assad government has been accused of cynically manipulating sectarian identity and anti-imperialism to continue its worst activities.[294] During a visit to the University of Damascus in November 2005, British politician George Galloway said of Assad, and of the country he leads: \"For me he is the last Arab ruler, and Syria is the last Arab country. It is the fortress of the remaining dignity of the Arabs,\"[295] and a \"breath of fresh air\".[296]\nHadash has expressed support for the Government of Bashar al-Assad.[297] Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea and Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong-un has expressed support for Assad in face of a growing civil war.[298] The leader of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and President of Venezuela Nicol\u00e1s Maduro reiterated his full support for the Syrian people in their struggle for peace and reaffirms its strong condemnation of \"the destabilizing actions that are still in Syria, with encouragement from members of NATO\".[299] The leader of the National Liberation Front and President of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has sent a cable of congratulations to Assad, on the occasion of winning his presidential elections.[300] The leader of Guyana's People's Progressive Party and President of Guyana, Donald Ramotar, said that Assad's win in the presidential election is a great victory for Syria.[301] The leader of the African National Congress and President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, congratulated Assad on winning the presidential elections.[302] The leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, has said that Assad's victory (in the presidential elections) is an important step to \"attain peace in Syria and a clear cut evidence that the Syrian people trust their president as a national leader and support his policies which aim at maintaining Syria's sovereignty and unity\".[303] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine supports the Assad government.[304][305] The leader of Fatah and President of the State of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, has said that electing President Assad means \"preserving Syria's unity and sovereignty and that it will help end the crisis and confront terrorism, wishing prosperity and safety to Syria\".[306][307][308]\nPresident of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko has expressed confidence that Syria will eliminate the current crisis and continue under the leadership of President al-Assad \"the fight against terrorism and foreign interference in its internal affairs\".[309]\nIn order to promote their image and media-portrayal overseas, Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad hired United States- and United Kingdom-based PR firms and consultants.[310] In particular, these secured photoshoots for Asma al-Assad with fashion and celebrity magazines, including Vogue's March 2011 \"A Rose in the Desert\".[311][312] These firms included Bell Pottinger and Brown Lloyd James, with the latter being paid $5,000 a month for their services.[310][313]\nAt the outset of the Syrian Civil War, Syrian government networks were hacked by the group Anonymous, revealing that an ex-Al Jazeera journalist had been hired to advise Assad on how to manipulate the public opinion of the United States. Among the advice was the suggestion to compare the popular uprising against the regime to the Occupy Wall Street protests.[314] In a separate e-mail leak several months later by the Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution, which were published by The Guardian, it was revealed that Assad's consultants had coordinated with an Iranian government media advisor.[315] In March 2015, an expanded version of the aforementioned leaks was handed to the Lebanese NOW News website and published the following month.[316]\nAfter the Syrian Civil War began, the Assads started a social media campaign which included building a presence on Facebook, YouTube, and most notably Instagram.[313] A Twitter account for Assad was reportedly activated, however it remained unverified.[317] This resulted in much criticism, and was described by The Atlantic Wire as \"a propaganda campaign that ultimately has made the [Assad] family look worse\".[318] The Assad government has also allegedly arrested activists for creating Facebook groups that the government disapproved of,[96] and has appealed directly to Twitter to remove accounts it disliked.[319] The social media campaign, as well as the previously leaked e-mails, led to comparisons with Hannah Arendt's A Report on the Banality of Evil by The Guardian, The New York Times and the Financial Times.[320][321][322]\nIn October 2014, 27,000 photographs depicting torture committed by the Assad government were put on display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.[323][324] Lawyers were hired to write a report on the images by the British law firm Carter-Ruck, which in turn was funded by the Government of Qatar.[325]\nIn November 2014, the Quilliam Foundation reported that a propaganda campaign, which they claimed had the \"full backing of Assad\", spread false reports about the deaths of Western-born jihadists in order to deflect attention from the government's alleged war crimes. Using a picture of a Chechen fighter from the Second Chechen War, pro-Assad media reports disseminated to Western media outlets, leading them to publish a false story regarding the death of a non-existent British jihadist.[326]\nIn 2015, Russia intervened in the Syrian Civil War in support of Assad, and on 21 October 2015, Assad flew to Moscow and met with Russian president Vladimir Putin, who said regarding the civil war: \"this decision can be made only by the Syrian people. Syria is a friendly country. And we are ready to support it not only militarily but politically as well.\".[327]\nAssad speaks fluent English and basic conversational French, having studied at the Franco-Arab al-Hurriyah school in Damascus.[328]\nIn December 2000, Assad married Asma al-Assad (n\u00e9e Akhras), a British citizen of Syrian origin from Acton, London.[329][330] In 2001, Asma gave birth to their first child, a son named Hafez after the child's grandfather Hafez al-Assad. Their daughter Zein was born in 2003, followed by their second son Karim in 2004.[33]\nAssad's sister, Bushra al-Assad, and mother, Anisa Makhlouf, left Syria in 2012 and 2013, respectively, to live in the United Arab Emirates.[33] Makhlouf died in Damascus in 2016.[331]\nRevoked and returned distinctions are marked with red.\nBibliography\nReports\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJeffrey Preston Bezos (/\u02c8be\u026azo\u028as/;[a][3] n\u00e9 Jorgensen; born January 12, 1964) is an American internet and aerospace entrepreneur, media proprietor, and investor. He is best known as the founder, chief executive officer, and president of Amazon. The first centi-billionaire on the Forbes wealth index, Bezos was named the \"richest man in modern history\" after his net worth increased to $150\u00a0billion in July 2018.[4] In September 2018, Forbes described him as \"far richer than anyone else on the planet\" as he added $1.8\u00a0billion to his net worth when Amazon became the second company in history to reach a market cap of $1\u00a0trillion. Bezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and raised in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. He founded the online retailer Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest internet company by revenue, as well as the world's largest provider of AI assistance[5] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services arm. Bezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. A Blue Origin test flight successfully first reached space in 2015, and the company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[6] Bezos also purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for US$250\u00a0million in cash and manages many other investments through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions. Bezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, the son of Jacklyn (Gise) Jorgensen and Ted Jorgensen.[7] At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student, and his father was a bike shop owner.[8] After Jacklyn divorced Ted, she married Cuban immigrant Miguel \"Mike\" Bezos in April 1968.[9] Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.[10] The family moved to Houston, Texas, where Mike worked as an engineer for Exxon after he received a degree from the University of New Mexico.[11] Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[12] Bezos' maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[13] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[11] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117\u00a0ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406\u00a0ha).[14][15] His maternal grandmother was Mattie Louise Gise (n\u00e9e Strait), through whom he is a cousin of country singer George Strait.[16] Bezos often displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency; he once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[17][18] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.[19][20] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[21] He attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[22][23] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[22] In the graduation speech Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when the people of earth would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention \"to get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.\"[24] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 grade point average and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[25][26] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.[27][28] After Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others.[29] He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade.[30] Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter.[31] He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust; he worked there from 1988 to 1990.[31] He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly founded hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling, in 1990 and worked there until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president at the age of 30.[31][29] In late 1993, Bezos decided to establish an online bookstore.[32] He left his job at D.\u00a0E. Shaw and founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle.[33][34] Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[35] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents and invested in Amazon.[34] He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[36] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[31][35] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[37] In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.[35] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video; by the end of the year, he had also expanded the company's products to include a variety of consumer goods.[35] Bezos used the $54\u00a0million raised during the company's 1997 equity offering to finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[35] In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2\u00a0billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350\u00a0million.[38] In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic.[35] In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[39] After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[38] In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400\u00a0million.[40] In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle.[41] According to a 2008 Time profile, Bezos wished to create the same flow state found in video game simulations in books; he wished readers would fully engage with books.[42] In 2013, Bezos secured a $600\u00a0million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[43] In October that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[44] In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671\u00a0million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[45] On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7\u00a0million.[46] A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[47] By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109\u00a0billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin.[48] On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial.[49] On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2\u00a0billion.[50] Due to the growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon into India.[51] On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became the world's wealthiest person over Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated net worth increased to just over $90\u00a0billion. His wealth surpassed $100\u00a0billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by Forbes on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[52] In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5\u00a0billion to localize operations throughout the company's supply chain routes.[53] Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon\u2013and Bezos, specifically\u2013of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal routes, and anti-competitive business practices.[54] Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos' personal wealth by $10.7\u00a0billion.[55] Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out of Stanford University indicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[56] During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon's face recognition software, Rekognition.[57] Additionally, statements by the Trump administration, in favor of overturning the antitrust law known as the Paramount Decree, have been predicted to help Amazon acquire the Landmark Theaters chain.[58] Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receiving corporate welfare.[59] This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied on food stamps.[60] While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: \"Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?\"[61] He later said: \"Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America.\"[62] Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary \"misleading\" as it included part-time workers.[63] However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[64] On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[65] The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour \u2013 a decision that was interpreted as support for the Fight for $15 movement.[66] In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup company.[67] Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the solar system.[23] He was the valedictorian when he graduated from high school in 1982. His speech was followed up with a Miami Herald interview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[68] The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.[69] After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006, when it purchased a large tract of land in West Texas for a launch and test facility.[70] After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[71] In September 2011, one of the company's unmanned prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancing spaceflight.[72] In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[73] He has been compared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[74] In 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[75] Later in November, Blue Origin's New Shepard space vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[76] He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated with business-related pollution.[77] In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[78] To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[79] Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes to colonize the solar system, and has been selling $1\u00a0billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[80][81] In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve the natural resources of Earth by making the human species multi-planetary.[82] He announced that New Shepard would begin transporting humans into sub-orbital space by November 2018.[82] In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[83] On August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of The Washington Post for $250\u00a0million in cash.[84] To execute the sale, he established Nash Holdings, a limited liability holding company that legally owns the paper.[85] The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control.[86] In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at The Washington Post and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii, and Minnesota.[87] In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the newspaper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software.[88] Throughout the early years of ownership, Bezos was accused of having a potential conflict of interest with the paper.[89] Bezos and the newspaper's editorial board have dismissed accusations that he unfairly controlled the paper's content and Bezos maintains the paper's independence.[90][91] After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos made the purchase in 2013.[91] Bezos makes personal investments through his venture capital vehicle, Bezos Expeditions.[92] He was one of the first shareholders in Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3\u00a0million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1\u00a0billion in 2017.[93][94] He also invested in Unity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[95] Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology, Grail, Juno Therapeutics, and ZocDoc.[96] In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos' role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later named Haven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.[97][98] Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[99] Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics at Princeton Neuroscience Institute.[100][101] In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of two Saturn V first-stage Rocketdyne F-1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[102] They were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission's S-1C stage from July 1969.[103][104] The engine is currently on display at the Seattle Museum of Flight.[105][106] Journalist Nellie Bowles of The New York Times has described the public persona and personality of Bezos as that of \"a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan\".[107] During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense of public charity and social welfare.[107][108] His business practices projected a public image of prudence and parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. Bezos was a multi-billionaire who hung his clothes on a rack in his Amazon headquarters office and drove a 1996 Honda Accord.[109] Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[110][111][112] Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[113][114] This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman who described him as \"talking in lists\" and \"[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made.\"[110] Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrote an unauthorized book that described Bezos as a demanding boss as well as hyper-competitive.[108][113] Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles and externalities.[115][116] During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to wear tailored clothing; he weight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[117] His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as the metonym of the company.[118][119] His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has been parodied as an enterprising super villain.[120][121][122] Since 2017, he has been portrayed by Kyle Mooney and Steve Carell on Saturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[123] Bezos eats exotic foods, such as octopus and roasted iguana.[124][125][126] In May 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation named Bezos the \"World's Worst Boss\", with its general secretary Sharan Burrow saying: \"Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model.\"[127] During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[14] His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[128][14] Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing a New York Times piece.[129][130] Bezos has stated \"it is always Day 1\" to describe his growth mindset.[131][132] Bezos used what he called a \"regret-minimization framework\" while he worked at D.\u00a0E. Shaw and again during the early years of Amazon.[133] He described this life philosophy by stating: \"When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes.\"[133] During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[134] To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the mantra \"Get Big Fast\", which spoke to the company's need to scale its operations and establish market dominance.[35] He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of dividends.[110] Bezos uses the term \"work\u2013life harmony\" instead of the more standard work\u2013life balance because he believes balance implies that you can have one and not the other.[135] He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[135] Journalist Walt Mossberg dubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting, \"The Bezos Principle\".[136] Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule\u2013a preference for meetings to be small enough to where two pizzas can feed everyone in the board room.[137] When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise the common standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[138] He meets with Amazon investors for a total of only six hours a year.[137] Instead of using PowerPoints, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[139] Starting in 1998, Bezos publishes an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers not competitors, take risks for market leadership, facilitate staff morale, build a company culture, and empower people.[140][141] Bezos maintains the email address \"jeff@amazon.com\" as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company.[142] Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[142] Bezos has cited Warren Buffett (of Berkshire Hathaway), Jamie Dimon (of JPMorgan Chase), and Bob Iger (of Walt Disney) as major influences on his leadership style.[143] Bezos first became a millionaire in 1997 after raising $54\u00a0million through Amazon's initial public offering (IPO).[157] He was first included on the Forbes World's Billionaires list in 1999 with a registered net worth of $10.1\u00a0billion.[158] His net worth decreased to $6.1\u00a0billion a year later, a 40.5% drop.[159] His wealth plummeted even more the following year, dropping 66.6% to $2.0\u00a0billion.[160] He lost $500\u00a0million the following year, which brought his net worth down to $1.5\u00a0billion.[161] The following year, his net worth increased by 104% to $2.5\u00a0billion.[162] From 2005 to 2007, he quadrupled his net worth to $8.7\u00a0billion.[163] After the financial crisis and succeeding economic recession, his net worth would erode to $6.8\u00a0billion\u2014a 17.7% drop.[164][165] His wealth rose by 85.2% in 2010, leaving him with $12.6\u00a0billion. This percentage increase ascended him to the 43rd spot on the ranking from 68th.[164][166] After a rumor broke out that Amazon was developing a smartphone, Bezos' net worth rose to $30.5\u00a0billion in 2014.[167][168] A year later, Bezos entered the top ten when he increased his net worth to a total of $50.3\u00a0billion.[169] Bezos rose to be the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7\u00a0billion in one hour.[169] By the time the Forbes list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2\u00a0billion.[170] However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2\u00a0billion to $66.5\u00a0billion unofficially ranking him the third richest person in the world behind Warren Buffett.[171] After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.[172] Bezos would continue to sporadically surpass Gates throughout the month of October 2017 after Amazon's share price fluctuated.[173] His net worth surpassed $100\u00a0billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, after Amazon's share price increased by more than 2.5%.[174] When the 2017 list was issued, Bezos' net worth was registered at $72.8\u00a0billion, adding $27.6\u00a0billion from the previous year.[175] Bezos was officially ranked as the third wealthiest person in the world up from the 5th spot in 2016.[175] His wealth's rapid growth from 2016 to 2017 sparked a variety of assessments about how much money Bezos earned on a controlled, reduced time scale. On October 10, 2017, he made an estimated $6.24\u00a0billion in 5 minutes, slightly less than the annual Gross Domestic Product of Kyrgyzstan.[176] On March 6, 2018, Bezos was officially designated the wealthiest person in the world with a registered net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[177] He unseated Bill Gates ($90\u00a0billion) who was $6\u00a0billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84\u00a0billion), ranked third.[178] He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).[c] His wealth, in 2017\u201318 terms, equaled that of 2.7\u00a0million Americans.[184] Bezos' net worth increased by $33.6\u00a0billion from January 2017 to January 2018. This increase outstripped the economic development (in GDP terms) of more than 96 countries around the world.[185] During March 9, Bezos earned $230,000 every 60 seconds.[186] The Motley Fool estimated that if Bezos had not sold any of his shares from its original public offering in 1997, his net worth would sit at $181\u00a0billion in 2018.[187] According to Quartz, his net worth of $150\u00a0billion in July 2018 was enough to purchase the entire stock markets of Nigeria, Hungary, Egypt, Luxembourg, and Iran.[188] Following the report by Quartz, Amazon workers in Poland, (Germany), and Spain participated in demonstrations and labor strikes to draw attention to his growing wealth and the lack of compensation, labor rights, and satisfactory working conditions of select Amazon workers.[189] On July 17, 2018 he was designated the \"wealthiest person in modern history\"[d] by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,[192] Fortune,[193] MarketWatch,[194] The Wall Street Journal,[195] and Forbes.[191] In 2019, Bezos's wealth was reduced by his divorce with his wife MacKenzie Bezos.[196] According to Forbes, had the Washington state common law applied to their divorce without a prenuptial agreement, Bezos' wealth could have been equitably divided with his ex-wife,[197][198] however she eventually received 25% of Bezos's Amazon shares, valued at approximately $36\u00a0billion, making her the third richest woman in the world. Bezos retained his interest in The Washington Post and Blue Origin, as well as voting control of the shares received by his ex-wife.[199] In June 2019, Bezos purchased three adjoining apartments overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan, including a penthouse, for a combined total of US$80\u00a0million, making this one of the most expensive real estate purchases within New York City in 2019.[200] In 1992, Bezos was working for D. E. Shaw in Manhattan when he met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm; the couple married a year later.[31][201] In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon.[202] He and his ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons, and one daughter adopted from China.[69][203] In March 2003, Bezos was one of three passengers in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas after the craft's tail boom hit a tree.[204] Bezos sustained minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.[26] In 2016, Bezos played a Starfleet official in the movie Star Trek Beyond, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening.[205] He had lobbied Paramount for the role and apropos of Alexa and his personal/professional interest in speech recognition his one line consisted of a response to an alien in distress: \"Speak Normally.\" In his initial discussion of the project which became Alexa with his technical advisor Greg Hart in 2011, Bezos told him that the goal was to create \"the Star Trek computer.\" [206] On January 9, 2019, Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, announced on Twitter their intent to divorce after a \"long period\" of separation.[207][208][209] On April 4, 2019, the divorce was finalized, with Bezos keeping 75% of the couple's Amazon stock and MacKenzie getting the remaining 25% ($35.6\u00a0billion) in Amazon stock. However, Bezos would keep all of the couple's voting rights.[210] On February 7, 2019, Bezos published an online essay in which he accused American Media, Inc. owner David Pecker of \"extortion and blackmail\" for threatening to publish intimate photos of Bezos and Lauren S\u00e1nchez, if he did not stop his investigation into how his text messages and other photos had been leaked to the National Enquirer.[211][212] According to public campaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns of Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, two Democratic U.S. senators from Washington. He has also supported U.S. representative John Conyers, as well as Patrick Leahy and Spencer Abraham, U.S. senators serving on committees dealing with Internet-related issues.[213] Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, and in 2012 contributed $2.5\u00a0million to Washington United for Marriage, a group supporting a yes vote on Washington Referendum 74, which affirmed a same-sex marriage law enacted in the state.[214] Bezos donated $100,000 towards a movement against a Washington state income tax in 2010 for \"top earners.\" [213] In 2012, he donated to Amazon's political action committee (PAC),[213] which has given $56,000 and $74,500 to Democrats and Republicans, respectively.[215] After the 2016 presidential election, Bezos was invited to join Donald Trump's Defense Innovation Advisory Board, an advisory council to improve the technology used by the Defense Department. Bezos declined the offer without further comment.[43][216] Trump has repeatedly attacked Bezos via Twitter, accused Bezos of avoiding corporate taxes, gaining undue political influence, and undermining his presidency by spreading \"fake news.\"[217][218] Bezos has repeatedly joked about using his rocket company to send Donald Trump into outer space.[219][220] In 2014, Amazon won a bid for a cloud computing contract with the CIA valued at $600\u00a0million.[221] A 2018, $10\u00a0billion contract known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project, this time with the Pentagon, was allegedly written up in a way that favors Amazon.[222] Controversy over this was raised when General James Mattis accepted a headquarters tour invitation from Bezos and co-ordinated the deal through Sally Donnelly, a lobbyist who previously worked for Amazon.[223] In November 2019, when the contract was awarded to Microsoft instead, Amazon filed a lawsuit with allegations that the bidding process was biased.[224][225] Despite Bezos' support for an open borders policy towards immigrants, Amazon has actively marketed facial recognition software to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[226] In 2019, a political action committee linked to Bezos spent over $1\u00a0million in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat activist Kshama Sawant in Seattle's city council election.[227] In March 2018, Bezos met in Seattle with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[228] In March 2019, Bezos' security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Bezos' phone. According to BBC, Bezos' top security staffer, Gavin de Becker, \"linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\" Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at the Washington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey\u2019s Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[229] On January 2020, The Guardian reported that hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in the Washington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos' mobile phone conducted by advisory firm FTI Consulting, concluded it \"highly probable\" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in a WhatsApp message to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on 1 May 2018.[230][231] Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[232] Bezos donated to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center several times between 2009 and 2017.[233] In 2013, he pledged $500,000 to Worldreader, a non-profit founded by a former Amazon employee.[234] In September 2018, Business Insider reported that Bezos was the only one of the top five billionaires in the world who had not signed the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that encourage wealthy people to give away their wealth.[235] That same month, philanthropy expert Janet Camarena, director of transparency initiatives at Foundation Center, was quoted by CNBC as having questions about Bezos\u2019 new fund, including the fund's structure and how exactly it will be funded.[236] On May 23, 2017, Bezos gave $1\u00a0million to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides pro bono legal services for American journalists.[237] On June 15, 2017, he posted a message on Twitter asking for ideas for philanthropy: \"I'm thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time\u2014working on the long term\".[14] At the time of the post, Bezos' lifetime spending on charitable causes was estimated to be $100\u00a0million.[14] Multiple journalists responded by asking Bezos to pay higher wages to Amazon warehouse workers.[238][239] A year later in June, he tweeted that he would announce two philanthropic foci by the end of summer 2018.[240] Bezos announced in September 2018 that he would commit approximately $2\u00a0billion to a fund to deal with American homelessness and establish a network of non-profit preschools for low income communities.[241] As part of this announcement, he committed to establishing the \"Day 1 Families Fund\" to finance \"night shelters and day care centers for homeless families\" and the \"Day 1 Academies Fund\" for early childhood education.[242][243] In January 2018, Bezos made a $33\u00a0million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors.[244] In June 2018, Bezos donated to Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private philanthropic fund founded by Bill Gates aimed at promoting emissions-free energy.[245] In September 2018, Bezos donated $10\u00a0million to With Honor, a nonpartisan organization that works to increase the number of veterans in political office.[246]",

He is best known as the founder, chief executive officer, and president of Amazon. The first centi-billionaire on the Forbes wealth index, Bezos was named the \"richest man in modern history\" after his net worth increased to $150\u00a0billion in July 2018.[4] In September 2018, Forbes described him as \"far richer than anyone else on the planet\" as he added $1.8\u00a0billion to his net worth when Amazon became the second company in history to reach a market cap of $1\u00a0trillion.\nBezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and raised in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. He founded the online retailer Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest internet company by revenue, as well as the world's largest provider of AI assistance[5] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services arm.\nBezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. A Blue Origin test flight successfully first reached space in 2015, and the company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[6] Bezos also purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for US$250\u00a0million in cash and manages many other investments through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions.\nBezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, the son of Jacklyn (Gise) Jorgensen and Ted Jorgensen.[7] At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student, and his father was a bike shop owner.[8] After Jacklyn divorced Ted, she married Cuban immigrant Miguel \"Mike\" Bezos in April 1968.[9] Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.[10] The family moved to Houston, Texas, where Mike worked as an engineer for Exxon after he received a degree from the University of New Mexico.[11] Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[12]\nBezos' maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[13] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[11] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117\u00a0ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406\u00a0ha).[14][15] His maternal grandmother was Mattie Louise Gise (n\u00e9e Strait), through whom he is a cousin of country singer George Strait.[16] Bezos often displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency; he once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[17][18]\nThe family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.[19][20] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[21] He attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[22][23] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[22] In the graduation speech Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when the people of earth would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention \"to get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.\"[24]\nIn 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 grade point average and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[25][26] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.[27][28]\nAfter Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others.[29] He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade.[30] Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter.[31] He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust; he worked there from 1988 to 1990.[31] He then joined D. E. Shaw &amp; Co, a newly founded hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling, in 1990 and worked there until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president at the age of 30.[31][29]\n\nIn late 1993, Bezos decided to establish an online bookstore.[32] He left his job at D.\u00a0E. Shaw and founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle.[33][34] Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra  but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[35] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents and invested in Amazon.[34] He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[36] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[31][35] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[37] In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble.[35] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video; by the end of the year, he had also expanded the company's products to include a variety of consumer goods.[35] Bezos used the $54\u00a0million raised during the company's 1997 equity offering to finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[35] In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2\u00a0billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350\u00a0million.[38] In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic.[35] In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[39] After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[38] In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400\u00a0million.[40] In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle.[41] According to a 2008 Time profile, Bezos wished to create the same flow state found in video game simulations in books; he wished readers would fully engage with books.[42] In 2013, Bezos secured a $600\u00a0million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[43] In October that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[44]\nIn May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671\u00a0million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[45] On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7\u00a0million.[46] A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[47] By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109\u00a0billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin.[48] On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial.[49] On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2\u00a0billion.[50] Due to the growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon into India.[51] On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became the world's wealthiest person over Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated net worth increased to just over $90\u00a0billion. His wealth surpassed $100\u00a0billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by Forbes on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[52]\nIn March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5\u00a0billion to localize operations throughout the company's supply chain routes.[53] Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon\u2013and Bezos, specifically\u2013of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal routes, and anti-competitive business practices.[54] Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos' personal wealth by $10.7\u00a0billion.[55] Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out of Stanford University indicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[56] During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon's face recognition software, Rekognition.[57] Additionally, statements by the Trump administration, in favor of overturning the antitrust law known as the Paramount Decree, have been predicted to help Amazon acquire the Landmark Theaters chain.[58]\nCriticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receiving corporate welfare.[59] This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied on food stamps.[60] While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: \"Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?\"[61] He later said: \"Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America.\"[62] Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary \"misleading\" as it included part-time workers.[63] However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[64] On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[65] The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour \u2013 a decision that was interpreted as support for the Fight for $15 movement.[66]\nIn September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup company.[67] Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the solar system.[23] He was the valedictorian when he graduated from high school in 1982. His speech was followed up with a Miami Herald interview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[68] The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.[69]\nAfter its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006, when it purchased a large tract of land in West Texas for a launch and test facility.[70] After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[71] In September 2011, one of the company's unmanned prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancing spaceflight.[72] In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[73] He has been compared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[74]\nIn 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[75] Later in November, Blue Origin's New Shepard space vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[76] He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated with business-related pollution.[77]\nIn December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[78] To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[79] Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes to colonize the solar system, and has been selling $1\u00a0billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[80][81] In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve the natural resources of Earth by making the human species multi-planetary.[82] He announced that New Shepard would begin transporting humans into sub-orbital space by November 2018.[82] In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[83]\nOn August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of The Washington Post for $250\u00a0million in cash.[84] To execute the sale, he established Nash Holdings, a limited liability holding company that legally owns the paper.[85] The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control.[86] In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at The Washington Post and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii, and Minnesota.[87] In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the newspaper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software.[88] Throughout the early years of ownership, Bezos was accused of having a potential conflict of interest with the paper.[89] Bezos and the newspaper's editorial board have dismissed accusations that he unfairly controlled the paper's content and Bezos maintains the paper's independence.[90][91] After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos made the purchase in 2013.[91]\nBezos makes personal investments through his venture capital vehicle, Bezos Expeditions.[92] He was one of the first shareholders in Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3\u00a0million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1\u00a0billion in 2017.[93][94] He also invested in Unity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[95] Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology, Grail, Juno Therapeutics, and ZocDoc.[96] In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos' role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later named Haven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.[97][98]\nBezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[99] Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics at Princeton Neuroscience Institute.[100][101] In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of two Saturn V first-stage Rocketdyne F-1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[102] They were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission's S-1C stage from July 1969.[103][104] The engine is currently on display at the Seattle Museum of Flight.[105][106]\nJournalist Nellie Bowles of The New York Times has described the public persona and personality of Bezos as that of \"a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan\".[107] During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense of public charity and social welfare.[107][108] His business practices projected a public image of prudence and parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. Bezos was a multi-billionaire who hung his clothes on a rack in his Amazon headquarters office and drove a 1996 Honda Accord.[109] Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[110][111][112]\nBezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[113][114] This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman who described him as \"talking in lists\" and \"[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made.\"[110] Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrote an unauthorized book that described Bezos as a demanding boss as well as hyper-competitive.[108][113] Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles and externalities.[115][116]\nDuring the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to wear tailored clothing; he weight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[117] His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as the metonym of the company.[118][119] His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has been parodied as an enterprising super villain.[120][121][122] Since 2017, he has been portrayed by Kyle Mooney and Steve Carell on Saturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[123] Bezos eats exotic foods, such as octopus and roasted iguana.[124][125][126] In May 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation named Bezos the \"World's Worst Boss\", with its general secretary Sharan Burrow saying: \"Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model.\"[127] During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[14] His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[128][14] Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing a New York Times piece.[129][130]\nBezos has stated \"it is always Day 1\" to describe his growth mindset.[131][132]\nBezos used what he called a \"regret-minimization framework\" while he worked at D.\u00a0E. Shaw and again during the early years of Amazon.[133] He described this life philosophy by stating: \"When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes.\"[133] During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[134] To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the mantra \"Get Big Fast\", which spoke to the company's need to scale its operations and establish market dominance.[35] He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of dividends.[110]\nBezos uses the term \"work\u2013life harmony\" instead of the more standard work\u2013life balance because he believes balance implies that you can have one and not the other.[135] He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[135] Journalist Walt Mossberg dubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting, \"The Bezos Principle\".[136] Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule\u2013a preference for meetings to be small enough to where two pizzas can feed everyone in the board room.[137] When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise the common standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[138]\nHe meets with Amazon investors for a total of only six hours a year.[137] Instead of using PowerPoints, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[139] Starting in 1998, Bezos publishes an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers not competitors, take risks for market leadership, facilitate staff morale, build a company culture, and empower people.[140][141] Bezos maintains the email address \"jeff@amazon.com\" as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company.[142] Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[142] Bezos has cited Warren Buffett (of Berkshire Hathaway), Jamie Dimon (of JPMorgan Chase), and Bob Iger (of Walt Disney) as major influences on his leadership style.[143]\nBezos first became a millionaire in 1997 after raising $54\u00a0million through Amazon's initial public offering (IPO).[157] He was first included on the Forbes World's Billionaires list in 1999 with a registered net worth of $10.1\u00a0billion.[158] His net worth decreased to $6.1\u00a0billion a year later, a 40.5% drop.[159] His wealth plummeted even more the following year, dropping 66.6% to $2.0\u00a0billion.[160] He lost $500\u00a0million the following year, which brought his net worth down to $1.5\u00a0billion.[161] The following year, his net worth increased by 104% to $2.5\u00a0billion.[162] From 2005 to 2007, he quadrupled his net worth to $8.7\u00a0billion.[163] After the financial crisis and succeeding economic recession, his net worth would erode to $6.8\u00a0billion\u2014a 17.7% drop.[164][165] His wealth rose by 85.2% in 2010, leaving him with $12.6\u00a0billion. This percentage increase ascended him to the 43rd spot on the ranking from 68th.[164][166]\nAfter a rumor broke out that Amazon was developing a smartphone, Bezos' net worth rose to $30.5\u00a0billion in 2014.[167][168] A year later, Bezos entered the top ten when he increased his net worth to a total of $50.3\u00a0billion.[169] Bezos rose to be the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7\u00a0billion in one hour.[169] By the time the Forbes list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2\u00a0billion.[170] However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2\u00a0billion to $66.5\u00a0billion unofficially ranking him the third richest person in the world behind Warren Buffett.[171] After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.[172]\nBezos would continue to sporadically surpass Gates throughout the month of October 2017 after Amazon's share price fluctuated.[173] His net worth surpassed $100\u00a0billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, after Amazon's share price increased by more than 2.5%.[174] When the 2017 list was issued, Bezos' net worth was registered at $72.8\u00a0billion, adding $27.6\u00a0billion from the previous year.[175] Bezos was officially ranked as the third wealthiest person in the world up from the 5th spot in 2016.[175] His wealth's rapid growth from 2016 to 2017 sparked a variety of assessments about how much money Bezos earned on a controlled, reduced time scale. On October 10, 2017, he made an estimated $6.24\u00a0billion in 5 minutes, slightly less than the annual Gross Domestic Product of Kyrgyzstan.[176]\nOn March 6, 2018, Bezos was officially designated the wealthiest person in the world with a registered net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[177] He unseated Bill Gates ($90\u00a0billion) who was $6\u00a0billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84\u00a0billion), ranked third.[178] He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).[c]\nHis wealth, in 2017\u201318 terms, equaled that of 2.7\u00a0million Americans.[184] Bezos' net worth increased by $33.6\u00a0billion from January 2017 to January 2018. This increase outstripped the economic development (in GDP terms) of more than 96 countries around the world.[185] During March 9, Bezos earned $230,000 every 60 seconds.[186] The Motley Fool estimated that if Bezos had not sold any of his shares from its original public offering in 1997, his net worth would sit at $181\u00a0billion in 2018.[187] According to Quartz, his net worth of $150\u00a0billion in July 2018 was enough to purchase the entire stock markets of Nigeria, Hungary, Egypt, Luxembourg, and Iran.[188] Following the report by Quartz, Amazon workers in Poland, (Germany), and Spain participated in demonstrations and labor strikes to draw attention to his growing wealth and the lack of compensation, labor rights, and satisfactory working conditions of select Amazon workers.[189] On July 17, 2018 he was designated the \"wealthiest person in modern history\"[d] by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,[192] Fortune,[193] MarketWatch,[194] The Wall Street Journal,[195] and Forbes.[191]\nIn 2019, Bezos's wealth was reduced by his divorce with his wife MacKenzie Bezos.[196] According to Forbes, had the Washington state common law applied to their divorce without a prenuptial agreement, Bezos' wealth could have been equitably divided with his ex-wife,[197][198] however she eventually received 25% of Bezos's Amazon shares, valued at approximately $36\u00a0billion, making her the third richest woman in the world. Bezos retained his interest in The Washington Post and Blue Origin, as well as voting control of the shares received by his ex-wife.[199]\nIn June 2019, Bezos purchased three adjoining apartments overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan, including a penthouse, for a combined total of US$80\u00a0million, making this one of the most expensive real estate purchases within New York City in 2019.[200]\nIn 1992, Bezos was working for D. E. Shaw in Manhattan when he met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm; the couple married a year later.[31][201] In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon.[202] He and his ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons, and one daughter adopted from China.[69][203]\nIn March 2003, Bezos was one of three passengers in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas after the craft's tail boom hit a tree.[204] Bezos sustained minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.[26]\nIn 2016, Bezos played a Starfleet official in the movie Star Trek Beyond, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening.[205] He had lobbied Paramount for the role and apropos of Alexa and his personal/professional interest in speech recognition his one line consisted of a response to an alien in distress:  \"Speak Normally.\"  In his initial discussion of the project which became Alexa with his technical advisor Greg Hart in 2011, Bezos told him that the goal was to create \"the Star Trek computer.\" [206]\nOn January 9, 2019, Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, announced on Twitter their intent to divorce after a \"long period\" of separation.[207][208][209] On April 4, 2019, the divorce was finalized, with Bezos keeping 75% of the couple's Amazon stock and MacKenzie getting the remaining 25% ($35.6\u00a0billion) in Amazon stock. However, Bezos would keep all of the couple's voting rights.[210]\nOn February 7, 2019, Bezos published an online essay in which he accused American Media, Inc. owner David Pecker of \"extortion and blackmail\" for threatening to publish intimate photos of Bezos and Lauren S\u00e1nchez, if he did not stop his investigation into how his text messages and other photos had been leaked to the National Enquirer.[211][212]\nAccording to public campaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns of Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, two Democratic U.S. senators from Washington. He has also supported U.S. representative John Conyers, as well as Patrick Leahy and Spencer Abraham, U.S. senators serving on committees dealing with Internet-related issues.[213] Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, and in 2012 contributed $2.5\u00a0million to Washington United for Marriage, a group supporting a yes vote on Washington Referendum 74, which affirmed a same-sex marriage law enacted in the state.[214] Bezos donated $100,000 towards a movement against a Washington state income tax in 2010 for \"top earners.\" [213] In 2012, he donated to Amazon's political action committee (PAC),[213] which has given $56,000 and $74,500 to Democrats and Republicans, respectively.[215]\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, Bezos was invited to join Donald Trump's Defense Innovation Advisory Board, an advisory council to improve the technology used by the Defense Department. Bezos declined the offer without further comment.[43][216] Trump has repeatedly attacked Bezos via Twitter, accused Bezos of avoiding corporate taxes, gaining undue political influence, and undermining his presidency by spreading \"fake news.\"[217][218] Bezos has repeatedly joked about using his rocket company to send Donald Trump into outer space.[219][220]\nIn 2014, Amazon won a bid for a cloud computing contract with the CIA valued at $600\u00a0million.[221] A 2018, $10\u00a0billion contract known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project, this time with the Pentagon, was allegedly written up in a way that favors Amazon.[222] Controversy over this was raised when General James Mattis accepted a headquarters tour invitation from Bezos and co-ordinated the deal through Sally Donnelly, a lobbyist who previously worked for Amazon.[223] In November 2019, when the contract was awarded to Microsoft instead, Amazon filed a lawsuit with allegations that the bidding process was biased.[224][225] Despite Bezos' support for an open borders policy towards immigrants, Amazon has actively marketed facial recognition software to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[226]\nIn 2019, a political action committee linked to Bezos spent over $1\u00a0million in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat activist Kshama Sawant in Seattle's city council election.[227]\nIn March 2018, Bezos met in Seattle with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[228] In March 2019, Bezos' security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Bezos' phone. According to BBC, Bezos' top security staffer, Gavin de Becker, \"linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\" Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at the Washington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey\u2019s Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[229]\nOn January 2020, The Guardian reported that hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in the Washington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos' mobile phone conducted by advisory firm FTI Consulting, concluded it \"highly probable\" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in a WhatsApp message to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on 1 May 2018.[230][231] Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[232]\nBezos donated to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center several times between 2009 and 2017.[233] In 2013, he pledged $500,000 to Worldreader, a non-profit founded by a former Amazon employee.[234]\nIn September 2018, Business Insider reported that Bezos was the only one of the top five billionaires in the world who had not signed the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that encourage wealthy people to give away their wealth.[235] That same month, philanthropy expert Janet Camarena, director of transparency initiatives at Foundation Center, was quoted by CNBC as having questions about Bezos\u2019 new fund, including the fund's structure and how exactly it will be funded.[236]\nOn May 23, 2017, Bezos gave $1\u00a0million to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides pro bono legal services for American journalists.[237] On June 15, 2017, he posted a message on Twitter asking for ideas for philanthropy: \"I'm thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time\u2014working on the long term\".[14] At the time of the post, Bezos' lifetime spending on charitable causes was estimated to be $100\u00a0million.[14] Multiple journalists responded by asking Bezos to pay higher wages to Amazon warehouse workers.[238][239] A year later in June, he tweeted that he would announce two philanthropic foci by the end of summer 2018.[240] Bezos announced in September 2018 that he would commit approximately $2\u00a0billion to a fund to deal with American homelessness and establish a network of non-profit preschools for low income communities.[241] As part of this announcement, he committed to establishing the \"Day 1 Families Fund\" to finance \"night shelters and day care centers for homeless families\" and the \"Day 1 Academies Fund\" for early childhood education.[242][243]\nIn January 2018, Bezos made a $33\u00a0million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors.[244] In June 2018, Bezos donated to Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private philanthropic fund founded by Bill Gates aimed at promoting emissions-free energy.[245] In September 2018, Bezos donated $10\u00a0million to With Honor, a nonpartisan organization that works to increase the number of veterans in political office.[246]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nDame Emma Thompson DBE[2] (born 15 April 1959) is a British actress, screenwriter, activist, author, and comedian. One of Britain's most acclaimed actresses, she often portrays enigmatic and matronly characters with a sense of wit, frequently in period dramas and literary adaptations. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, three BAFTA Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. Born in London to English actor Eric Thompson and Scottish actress Phyllida Law, Thompson was educated at Newnham College, University of Cambridge, where she became a member of the Footlights troupe. After appearing in several comedy programmes, she came to prominence in 1987 in two BBC TV series, Tutti Frutti and Fortunes of War, winning the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for her work in both series. Her first film role was in the 1989 romantic comedy The Tall Guy. In the early 1990s, she often collaborated with her then-husband, actor and director Kenneth Branagh. The pair became popular in the British media and co-starred in several films, including Dead Again (1991) and Much Ado About Nothing (1993). In 1992, Thompson won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for the period drama Howards End. In 1993, she garnered dual Academy Award nominations for her roles in The Remains of the Day as the housekeeper of a grand household and In the Name of the Father as a lawyer. Thompson scripted and starred in Sense and Sensibility (1995), which earned her numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, which makes her the only person to receive Academy Awards for both acting and writing, and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress. In 2013, she received acclaim and several award nominations for her portrayal of author P.\u00a0L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks. Other notable film and television credits include the Harry Potter film series (2004\u20132011), Wit (2001), Love Actually (2003), Angels in America (2003), Nanny McPhee (2005), Stranger than Fiction (2006), Last Chance Harvey (2008), Men in Black 3 (2012), and the sequel Men in Black: International (2019), Brave (2012), Beauty and the Beast (2017), Late Night (2019), and the BBC/HBO series Years and Years (2019). Thompson is married to actor Greg Wise, with whom she lives in London. They have one daughter. She is an activist in the areas of human rights and environmentalism[3] and has received criticism for her outspokenness. She has written two books adapted from The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours by Elizabeth II for her services to drama. Thompson was born in Paddington,[4][a] London, on 15 April 1959.[6] Her mother is the Scottish actress Phyllida Law, while her English father, Eric Thompson, was involved in theatre, and was the writer\u2013narrator of the popular children's television series The Magic Roundabout.[7][8] Her godfather was the director and writer Ronald Eyre.[9][10] She has one sister, Sophie Thompson, who also works as an actress.[7] The family lived in West Hampstead in north London,[8] and Thompson was educated at Camden School for Girls.[11] She spent much time in Scotland during her childhood and often visited Ardentinny, where her grandparents and uncle lived.[12] In her youth, Thompson was intrigued by language and literature, a trait which she attributes to her father, who shared her love of words.[13] After successfully taking A levels in English, French and Latin,[14] and securing a scholarship,[15] she began studying for an English degree at Newnham College, Cambridge,[16] arriving in 1977. Thompson believes that it was inevitable that she would become an actress, commenting that she was \"surrounded by creative people and I don't think it would ever have gone any other way, really\".[17] While there, she had a \"seminal moment\" that turned her to feminism and inspired her to take up performing. She explained in an interview in 2007 how she discovered the book The Madwoman in the Attic, \"which is about Victorian female writers and the disguises they took on in order to express what they wanted to express. That completely changed my life.\"[18] She became a self-professed \"punk rocker\",[19] with short red hair and a motorbike, and aspired to be a comedian like Lily Tomlin.[18] At Cambridge, Thompson was invited into Footlights, the university's prestigious sketch comedy troupe, by its president, Martin Bergman,[20] becoming its first female member.[21] Also in the troupe were fellow actors Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, and she had a romantic relationship with the latter.[22] Fry recalled that \"there was no doubt that Emma was going the distance. Our nickname for her was Emma Talented.\"[23] In 1980, Thompson served as the Vice President of Footlights,[24] and co-directed the troupe's first all-female revue, Woman's Hour.[20] The following year, Thompson and her Footlights team won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for their sketch show The Cellar Tapes.[25] Thompson graduated with upper second-class honours.[26] In 1982, Thompson's father died as a result of circulatory problems at the age of 53.[7] The actress has commented that this \"tore [the family] to pieces\",[27] and \"I can't begin to tell you how much I regret his not being around\".[28] She added, \"At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or courage to do what I've done\u00a0... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space. And power.\"[28] Thompson had her first professional role in 1982, touring in a stage version of Not the Nine O'Clock News.[6] She then turned to television, where much of her early work came with her Footlights co-stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. The regional ITV comedy series There's Nothing To Worry About! (1982) was their first outing, followed by the one-off BBC show The Crystal Cube (1983).[29] There's Nothing to Worry About! later returned as the networked sketch show Alfresco (1983\u201384), which ran for two series with Thompson, Fry, Laurie, Ben Elton, and Robbie Coltrane.[6][29] She later collaborated again with Fry and Laurie on the acclaimed BBC Radio 4 series Saturday Night Fry (1988). In 1985, Thompson was cast in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl, co-starring Robert Lindsay. It provided a breakthrough in her career, as the production earned rave reviews.[6][30] She played the role of Sally Smith for 15 months, which exhausted the actress; she later remarked \"I thought if I did the fucking \"Lambeth Walk\" one more time I was going to fucking throw up.\"[23] At the end of 1985, she wrote and starred in her own one-off special for Channel 4, Emma Thompson: Up for Grabs.[31] Thompson achieved another breakthrough in 1987,[6] when she had leading roles in two television miniseries: Fortunes of War, a World War II drama co-starring Kenneth Branagh, and Tutti Frutti, a dark-comedy about a Scottish rock band with Robbie Coltrane.[30] For these performances, Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress.[32] The following year, she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC, Thompson, but this was poorly received.[33] In 1989, she and Branagh\u2014who had formed a romantic relationship\u2014starred in a stage revival of Look Back in Anger, directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company.[30][34] Later that year, the pair starred in a televised version of the play.[6][34] Thompson's first cinema appearance came in the romantic comedy The Tall Guy (1989), the feature-film debut from screenwriter Richard Curtis.[30] It starred Jeff Goldblum as a West End actor, and Thompson played the nurse with whom he falls in love. The film was not widely seen,[35] but Thompson's performance was praised in The New York Times, where Caryn James called her \"an exceptionally versatile comic actress\".[36] She next turned to Shakespeare, appearing as Princess Katherine in Branagh's screen adaptation of Henry V (1989). The film was released to great critical acclaim.[37] Thompson and Branagh are considered by American writer and critic James Monaco to have led the \"British cinematic onslaught\" in the 1990s.[38] She continued to experiment with Shakespeare in the new decade, appearing with Branagh in his stage productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and King Lear.[30][34] Reviewing the latter, the Chicago Tribune praised her \"extraordinary\" performance of the \"hobbling, stooped hunchback Fool\".[39] Thompson returned to cinema in 1991, playing a \"frivolous aristocrat\"[6] in Impromptu with Judy Davis and Hugh Grant.[40] and Thompson was nominated for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards.[41] Her second release of 1991 was another pairing with Branagh, who also directed, in the Los Angeles-based noir Dead Again. She played a woman who has forgotten her identity.[42] Early in 1992, Thompson had a guest role in an episode of Cheers as Frasier Crane's first wife.[43] A turning point in Thompson's career[30] came when she was cast opposite Anthony Hopkins and Vanessa Redgrave in the Merchant Ivory period drama Howards End (1992), based on the novel by E. M. Forster. The film explored the social class system in Edwardian England, with Thompson playing an idealistic, intellectual, forward-looking woman who comes into association with a privileged and deeply conservative family. She actively pursued the role by writing to director James Ivory, who agreed to an audition and then gave her the part.[44] According to the critic Vincent Canby, the film allowed Thompson to \"[come] into her own\", away from Branagh.[45] Upon release, Roger Ebert wrote that she was \"superb in the central role: quiet, ironic, observant, with steel inside\".[46] Howards End was widely praised,[47] a \"surprise hit\",[48] and received nine Academy Award nominations.[49] Among its three wins was the Best Actress trophy for Thompson, who was also awarded a Golden Globe and BAFTA for her performance.[6] Reflecting on the role, The New York Times writes that the actress \"found herself an international success almost overnight\".[6] For her next two films, Thompson returned to working with Branagh. In Peter's Friends (1992), the pair starred with Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Imelda Staunton, and Tony Slattery as a group of Cambridge alumni who are reunited ten years after graduating. The comedy was positively reviewed,[50] and Desson Howe of The Washington Post wrote that Thompson was its highlight: \"Even as a rather one-dimensional character, she exudes grace and an adroit sense of comic tragedy.\"[51] She followed this with Branagh's screen version of Much Ado About Nothing (1993). The couple starred as Beatrice and Benedick, alongside a cast that also included Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, and Michael Keaton. Thompson was widely praised for the on-screen chemistry with Branagh and the natural ease with which she played the role[52][53] marking another critical success for Thompson.[54] Her performance earned a nomination for Best Female Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards.[41] Thompson reunited with Merchant\u2013Ivory and Anthony Hopkins to film The Remains of the Day (1993), a film which has been described as a \"classic\" and the production team's definitive film.[55][56] Based on Kazuo Ishiguro's novel about a housekeeper and butler in interwar Britain, the story is acclaimed for its study of loneliness and repression, though Thompson was particularly interested in looking at \"the deformity that servitude inflicts upon people\", since her grandmother had worked as a servant and made many sacrifices.[57] She has named the film as one of the greatest experiences of her career, considering it to be a \"masterpiece of withheld emotion\".[58] The Remains of the Day was a critical and commercial success,[55] receiving eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and a second Best Actress nod for Thompson.[59] Along with her Best Actress nomination at the 66th Academy Awards, Thompson was also nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category, making her the eighth performer in history to be nominated for two Oscars in the same year.[60] It came for her role as the lawyer Gareth Peirce in In the Name of the Father (1993), a drama about the Guildford Four starring Daniel Day-Lewis. The film was her second hit of the year, earning $65\u00a0million and critical praise, and was nominated for Best Picture along with The Remains of the Day.[61][62] In 1994, Thompson made her Hollywood debut playing a goofy doctor alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in the blockbuster Junior. Although the male pregnancy storyline was poorly received by most critics and flopped at the box office,[63] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the lead trio.[64] She returned to independent cinema for a lead role in Carrington, which studied the platonic relationship between artist Dora Carrington and writer Lytton Strachey (played by Jonathan Pryce). Roger Ebert remarked that Thompson had \"developed a specialty in unrequited love\",[65] and the TV Guide Film & Video Companion commented that her \"neurasthenic mannerisms, which usually drive us batty, are appropriate here\".[66] Thompson's Academy success continued with Sense and Sensibility (1995), generally considered to be the most popular and authentic of the numerous film adaptations of Jane Austen's novels made in the 1990s.[67][68][69] Thompson\u2014a lifelong lover of Austen's work\u2014was hired to write the film based on the period sketches in her series Thompson.[70] She spent five years developing the screenplay,[71] and took the role of the spinster sister Elinor Dashwood despite, at age 35, being 16 years older than the literary character.[72] Directed by Ang Lee and co-starring Kate Winslet, Sense and Sensibility received widespread critical praise and ranks among the highest-grossing films of Thompson's career.[73][74] Shelly Frome remarked that she displayed a \"great affinity for Jane Austen's style and wit\",[75] and Graham Fuller of Sight and Sound saw her as the film's auteur.[76] Thompson received a third nomination for Best Actress and won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay, making her the only person in history to win an Oscar for both acting and screenwriting.[77] She also earned a second BAFTA Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.[6] Thompson was absent from screens in 1996, but returned the following year with Alan Rickman's directorial debut, The Winter Guest. Set over one day in a Scottish seaside village, the drama allowed Thompson and her mother (Phyllida Law) to play mother and daughter on screen.[78] She then returned to America to appear in an episode of Ellen, and her self-parodying performance received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[30][79] For her second Hollywood role, Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols's Primary Colors (1998), playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton.[80] Thompson's character, Susan, is described as that of an \"ambitious, long-suffering wife\" who has to deal with her husband's infidelity.[81] The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office.[82][83] According to Kevin O'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror, Americans were \"blown away\" by her performance and accent, and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her.[84] Thompson rejected many of the offers, expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards, and stated \"LA is lovely as long as you know you can leave\". She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point, which influenced her decision to leave film for a year.[85] Thompson followed Primary Colors by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller Judas Kiss (1998).[86] When she became a mother in 1999, Thompson made a conscious decision to reduce her workload, and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles.[57][87] She was not seen on screen again until 2000, with only a small part in the British comedy Maybe Baby, which she appeared in as a favour to its director, her friend Ben Elton.[88] For the HBO television film Wit (2001), however, Thompson happily took the lead role in what she felt was \"one of the best scripts to have come out of America\".[89] Adapted from Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play, it focuses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project, and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right.[90] She was greatly drawn to the \"daredevil\" role,[91] for which she had no qualms about shaving her head.[92] Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by \"the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect\", and in 2008 he called it Thompson's finest work.[93] Caryn James of The New York Times also described it as \"one of her most brilliant performances\", adding \"we seem to be peering into a soul as embattled as its body.\"[94] The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes, Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Thompson's only credit of 2002 was a vocal performance in Disney's Treasure Planet, an adaptation of Treasure Island, where she voiced Captain Amelia. The animation earned far less than its large budget and was considered a \"box office disaster\".[95] This failure was countered the following year by one of Thompson's biggest commercial successes, Richard Curtis's romantic comedy Love Actually.[74] As part of an ensemble cast that included Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, and Colin Firth, she played a middle-class wife who suspects her husband (played by Alan Rickman) of infidelity. The scene in which her stalwart character breaks down was described by one critic as \"the best crying on screen ever\",[57] and in 2013, Thompson mentioned that she gets commended for this role more than any other.[96] She explained, \"I've had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer.\"[97] Her performance received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress.[98] Thompson continued with supporting roles in the 2003 drama Imagining Argentina, where she played a dissident-journalist abducted by the country's 1970s dictatorial regime. Antonio Banderas played the husband who tries to find her, in a film that most critics disliked.[99] The film was booed and jeered at when it was screened at the Venice Film Festival and received a scathing article in The Guardian.[100] Thompson had greater success that year when she worked with HBO for a second time in the acclaimed miniseries Angels in America (2003).[30] The show, also featuring Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, dealt with the AIDS epidemic in Reagan-era America. Thompson played three roles\u00a0\u2013 a nurse, a homeless woman, and the title role of The Angel of America\u00a0\u2013 and was again nominated for an Emmy Award.[79] In 2004, she played the eccentric Divination teacher Sybill Trelawney in the third Harry Potter film, the Prisoner of Azkaban, her character described as a \"hippy chick professor who teaches fortune-telling\".[101] She later reprised her role in the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and the Deathly Hallows\u00a0\u2013 Part 2 (2011),[30] and has called her time on the popular franchise \"great fun\".[57] \u2014Thompson on Nanny McPhee and its sequel, which she wrote and starred in.[57] The year 2005 saw the release of a project Thompson had been working on for nine years.[57] Loosely based on the Nurse Matilda stories that she read as a child, Thompson wrote the screenplay for the children's film Nanny McPhee\u00a0\u2013 which centres on a mysterious, unsightly nanny who must discipline a group of children. She also took the lead role, alongside Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury, in what was a highly personal project.[57][102] The film was a success, taking number one at the UK box office and earning $122\u00a0million worldwide.[103][104] Commenting on Thompson's screenplay, film critic Claudia Puig wrote that its \"well-worn storybook features are woven effectively into an appealing tale of youthful empowerment\".[105] The following year, Thompson appeared in the surreal American comedy\u2013drama Stranger than Fiction, playing a novelist whose latest character (played by Will Ferrell) is a real person who hears her narration in his head. Reviews for the film were generally favourable.[106] Following a brief, uncredited role in the post-apocalyptic blockbuster I Am Legend (2007),[107] Thompson played the devoutly Catholic Lady Marchmain in a 2008 film adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film,[108] but several picked Thompson out as its highlight.[109][110] Mark Kermode said \"Emma Thompson is to some extent becoming the new Judi Dench, as the person who kind of comes in for 15 minutes and is brilliant\u00a0... [but then] when she goes away, the rest of the movie has a real problem living up to the wattage of her presence\".[111] Thompson was further acclaimed for her work in the London-based romance Last Chance Harvey (2008), where she and Dustin Hoffman played a lonely, middle-aged pair who cautiously begin a relationship. Critics praised the chemistry between the two leads, and both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances.[112][113] Thompson's two 2009 films were both set in 1960s England, and in both she made cameo appearances: as a headmistress in the critically praised drama An Education[114] and as a \"tippling mother\" in Richard Curtis's The Boat that Rocked.[115] Five years after the original, Thompson returned to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during World War II. Building on the first film's success, it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was widely seen as an improvement.[116][117] The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship.[118] Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.[79] In 2012, Thompson made a rare appearance in a big-budget Hollywood film[57] when she played the head Agent in Men in Black 3\u00a0\u2013 a continuation of the popular sci-fi comedy franchise starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. With a worldwide gross of $624\u00a0million, MIB3 is Thompson's biggest commercial hit outside of the Harry Potter films.[74] This mainstream success continued with the Pixar film Brave, in which Thompson voiced Elinor\u00a0\u2013 the Scottish queen despairing at her daughter's defiance against tradition.[30] It was her second consecutive blockbuster release, and critics were generally kind to the film.[74][119] Also in 2012, Thompson played Queen Elizabeth II in an episode of Playhouse Presents, which dramatised an incident in 1982 when an intruder broke into the Queen's bedroom.[120] Her first film of 2013 was the fantasy romance Beautiful Creatures, in which she played an evil mother. The film aimed to capitalise on the success of The Twilight Saga, but was poorly reviewed and a box office disappointment.[121][122] Film critic Peter Travers was critical of Thompson's performance and \"outrageously awful Southern accent\", and feared \"the damage this crock may do to [her] reputation\".[123] Conversely, her next appearance was so successful that it led one journalist to write \"Emma Thompson is back, firing on all cylinders.\"[124] Saving Mr. Banks depicted the making of Mary Poppins, and starred Thompson as P.\u00a0L. Travers, curmudgeonly author of the source novel. The actress considered it to be the best script she had read in years and was delighted to be offered the role. She considered it to be the most challenging of her career because she had \"never really played anyone quite so contradictory or difficult before\", but found the inconsistent and complicated character \"a blissful joy to embody\".[57][125] The film was well-received, grossed $112\u00a0million worldwide, and Thompson's performance garnered critical acclaim.[124][126] The review in The Independent expressed thanks that her \"playing of Travers is so deft that we instantly warm to her, and forgive her her snobbery\",[127] while Total Film's critic felt that Thompson brought depth to the \"predictable\" film with \"her best performance in years\".[128] Thompson was nominated for Best Actress at the BAFTAs, SAGs and Golden Globes, and received the Lead Actress trophy from the National Board of Review. Her Angels in America co-star Meryl Streep stated that she was \"shocked\" over Thompson's failure to receive an Academy Award nomination for the film.[129] The romantic-comedy The Love Punch (2013) gave Thompson her second consecutive leading role, where she played half of a divorced couple who reunite to steal the man's ex-boss's jewellery.[130] In March 2014, she made her first stage appearance in 24 years\u00a0\u2013 and her New York debut\u00a0\u2013 in a Lincoln Center production of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. She appeared in the musical for five nights, and her \"playful\" performance of Mrs Lovett was highly praised; the critic Kayla Epstein wrote that she \"not only held her own against more experienced vocalists, but wound up running off with the show\".[131] She received her sixth Emmy nomination for the televised version of the show.[132] In 2014, Thompson provided the narration for the film Men, Women & Children,[133] The period drama Effie Gray, a project that she had been working on for many years, based on the true-life story of John Ruskin's disastrous marriage, was written by Thompson but became the subject of a copyright suit before being cleared for cinemas. The American playwright Gregory Murphy said that Thompson's screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay The Countess, which he claimed he had submitted to Thompson through a mutual friend in 2003 to consider the role of Elizabeth Eastlake in a proposed film of his play, and to Thompson's husband Greg Wise through a casting director to consider the role of John Ruskin in the play's 2005 West End production.[134] In 2008, Thompson announced that she and Wise \"had written a script together about John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic, which we want to make into a film.\"[135] After meeting with Thompson and her producers, Potboiler Productions, Murphy was offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson in settlement of his claim.[136] This settlement offer was later abandoned by Thompson, Greg Wise and their partner Donald Rosenfeld, when their company Sovereign Films took over production of the film and instigated the suit, creating the independent entity Effie Film, LLC, spearheaded by Rosenfeld, to litigate it.[137][138] In March 2013, District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence from which Murphy claimed \"some of the most troubling material\" had been removed,[139] ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were \"quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events\".[140][141] In response to Murphy's attorney's concerns that the completed film Effie Gray would not adhere to Thompson's second revised screenplay, Judge Griesa concluded his ruling by saying that Thompson's film would not infringe Murphy's play or screenplay \"only to the extent that it does not substantially deviate from the November 29, 2011 screenplay,\" the date of Thompson's second revised screenplay.[142] In May 2013, Effie Gray's Cannes Film Festival premiere was cancelled. In October 2013, the film was withdrawn from the Mill Valley Film Festival in California due to \"unforeseen circumstances\" according to producer Rosenfeld.[143][144] In December 2013, Thompson said of the still unreleased Effie Gray that its \"time has probably passed,\" comparing it to another project of hers that \"didn't happen either.\"[145] Effie Gray was released in October 2014, to a modest reception.[146] Thompson plays Elizabeth Eastlake and Greg Wise plays John Ruskin. They both declined to promote the film.[147][148] Camilla Long, reviewing Effie Gray in The Sunday Times, wrote \"nothing fits together\" and \"no one seems to know why they made this film. Where is Thompson's passion and commitment, or any hint of what she intended to achieve.\"[149] Manohla Dargis in her review in The New York Times called Effie Gray \"The cinematic equivalent of a Brazilian wax, the movie omits much of the story's most interesting material to create something that's been smoothly denatured.\"[150] Thompson's first film of 2015 was A Walk in the Woods, a comedy adapted from the book by Bill Bryson. She next starred in The Legend of Barney Thomson. Her role was a 77-year-old foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, Glaswegian former prostitute, the mother of the title character. Neither film was a critical success, although the latter received some positive reviews and Empire magazine wrote that Thomson was \"unforgettable\".[151][152][153] Later that year, she had a supporting role in the restaurant-based film Burnt. In 2016, she starred in the World War II-drama Alone in Berlin, based on the story of Otto and Elise Hampel. She also co-wrote the screenplay for Bridget Jones's Baby and appeared in the film as a doctor. In 2017, Thompson appeared as Mrs. Potts (played by Angela Lansbury in the 1991 animated film) in Disney's live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon and starring her Harry Potter co-star Emma Watson in the lead role.[154] It grossed $1.2\u00a0billion worldwide, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of all time. She also had a supporting role as a hippy in the Noah Baumbach-directed dramedy The Meyerowitz Stories, which played in competition at Cannes and received critical acclaim.[155] She followed it with a starring role in the film The Children Act, a drama about a family who refuse cancer treatment for their son based on religious beliefs. She had a cameo role as Queen Elizabeth I in the 2017 Christmas special of the BBC sitcom Upstart Crow. In 2018, she provided the voiceover for Greenpeace's palm-oil awareness commercial which Iceland picked to promote as their 2018 Christmas advertisement. The commercial was rejected by the advertising organization Clearcast due to Greenpeace's alleged involvement in politics, thus violating their code of conduct.[156][157] In 2019, Thompson starred in a leading role in Late Night, which was written by Mindy Kaling (who also co-starred in that film) and featured her as a popular TV host who hires a new writer to keep the show from getting replaced.[158] The film received positive reviews, with Thompson being singled out for praise, and Owen Gleiberman of Variety remarked that \"Thompson truly seems like a born talk-show host. Even when she's just riffing, she grounds Late Night in something real.\"[159] She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.[160] In the same year, she voiced as the Yeti Elder in the stop-motion animated film Missing Link, reprised her role as Agent O in a more substantial part in Men in Black: International, and co-produced and co-starred in the festive romantic comedy Last Christmas which was based on the song of the same name by George Michael, and was written by Thompson, her husband Greg Wise, and Bryony Kimmings.[161] Thompson is widely regarded as one of the finest actresses of her generation[162][163] and one of Britain's most recognisable actresses, accepted in Hollywood.[164][165] Early in her career, when she was closely associated with her first husband Kenneth Branagh, she was somewhat unpopular and considered a \"luvvy\".[165] The public warmed to her after the separation, and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s.[165][166] Her status has continued to grow; in 2008, journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience,[163] and Mark Kermode said of her performances, \"There is something about her which is\u00a0\u2014 you just trust her. You just think 'I'm in proper hands here.'\u00a0... She's up there with the great, I mean really great, British female performers\".[111] \u00a0\u2013 Thompson on her approach to acting[167] Thompson is particularly known for playing reticent women,[168] and Sands describes her as \"the best actress of our times on suffering borne with poignant dignity\".[163] According to Kate Kellaway of The Guardian, she specialises in playing \"a good woman in a frock\".[167] She also plays many haughty characters, with a \"bracing, nanny-like demeanour\",[23] but she is noted for her ability to win the empathy of audiences.[120][168] Thompson belongs to a group of highly decorated British actresses including Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham Carter who are known for appearing in \"heritage films\" and typically showing \"restraint, rendering emotions through intellect rather than feelings, and a sense of irony, which demonstrates the heroine's superior understanding\".[169][170] Projecting a typically \"British image\",[165] Thompson's often dogmatic and tight-jawed manner has also been compared to that of Maggie Smith.[171] With a background in comedy, Thompson's performances are typically delivered with an ironic touch. Ang Lee, director of Sense and Sensibility stated that Thompson's comedic approach may be her greatest asset as an actress, remarking, \"Emma is an extremely funny lady. Like Austen, she's laughing at her own culture while she's a part of it.\"[171] Thompson has stated that the \"most moving things are often also funny, in life and in art\" which is present in her film work.[17] She often brings her real personality to her roles, and Kellaway believes that her lack of conventional beauty contributes to her likeability as an actress.[163][167] Thompson, although born in London, has stated she feels Scottish: \"not only because I am half Scottish but also because I've spent half my life here\".[12] She frequently returns to Scotland and visits Dunoon in Argyll and Bute, where she owns a home. Thompson's first husband was the actor and director Kenneth Branagh, whom she met in 1987 while filming the television series Fortunes of War.[172] The couple married in 1989 and proceeded to appear in several films together, with Branagh often casting her in his own productions.[173] Dubbed a \"golden couple\" by the British media,[172] the relationship received considerable press interest.[8] The pair attempted to keep their relationship private, refusing to be interviewed or photographed together.[174] In September 1995, Thompson and Branagh announced that they had separated; their statement to the press blamed their work schedules, but it later emerged that he was having an affair with actress Helena Bonham Carter.[97] Thompson was living alone as the relationship with Branagh deteriorated, and entered into clinical depression.[27] While filming Sense and Sensibility in 1995, she began a relationship with her co-star Greg Wise. Commenting on how she was able to overcome her depression, she told BBC Radio 4, \"Work saved me and Greg saved me. He picked up the pieces and put them together again.\"[27] The couple have a daughter, Gaia, a pregnancy that was achieved through IVF treatment when Thompson was 39.[8] In 2003, Thompson and Wise were married in Dunoon.[175] The family's permanent residence is in West Hampstead, London, on the same road as her childhood home.[8] Also in 2003, Thompson and her husband informally adopted a Rwandan orphan and former child soldier named Tindyebwa Agaba. They met at a Refugee Council event when he was 16, and she invited him to spend Christmas at their home.[8] \"Slowly\", Thompson has commented, \"he became a sort of permanent fixture, came on holiday to Scotland with us, became part of the family.\"[176] Agaba became a British citizen in 2009.[177] Thompson has said of her religious views: I'm an atheist\u00a0... I regard religion with fear and suspicion. It's not enough to say that I don't believe in God. I actually regard the system as distressing: I am offended by some of the things said in the Bible and the Qur'an and I refute them.[178] She is politically liberal and a supporter of the Labour Party; she told the BBC Andrew Marr Show in 2010 that she had been a member of the party \"all my life\".[179] Thompson endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in both the 2015[180] and 2016 Labour Party leadership elections.[181] She has also expressed support for the Women's Equality Party.[182] Thompson has been a campaigner since her youth.[183] Since becoming a public figure she has regularly voiced her views and been involved in many issues, prompting criticism that she is overly outspoken.[183] In 2010, The Daily Telegraph asked: \"Emma Thompson: a national treasure or Britain's most annoying woman?\"[184] She has justified her assertiveness by saying, \"what I feel is that we all need to speak up and a woman who has got a louder voice needs to shout very loudly indeed.\"[183] She is particularly active in human rights work.[167] As an ambassador for the charity ActionAid she has travelled to Uganda, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Liberia, Burma and South Africa.[185] She is chair of the Helen Bamber Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture,[186] a patron of the Refugee Council,[187] and has a therapy room in her office for traumatised refugees.[167] Thompson is also an activist for Palestinians, having been a member of the British-based ENOUGH! coalition that seeks to end the \"Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank\".[188] She is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation,[189] and in 2009 Time named her a \"European Hero\" in recognition of \"her work to highlight the plight of AIDS sufferers in Africa\".[183] Thompson is also an active environmentalist. She is a supporter of Greenpeace, and in January 2009, as part of her campaign against climate change, she and three other members of the organisation bought land near the village of Sipson to deter the building of a third runway for Heathrow Airport.[190] In August 2014, Thompson and her daughter, Gaia, went on a Greenpeace \"Save the Arctic\" expedition to raise awareness of the dangers of drilling for oil.[191] She narrated The Real News Network's The Doubt Machine: Inside the Koch Brothers' War on Climate Science, a documentary short about Koch Industries and its efforts to discredit climate research.[192] The film was released on 31 October 2016. In 2019, she supported the London Extinction Rebellion rally against climate change, although she received some criticism for having flown 8,700 kilometres (5,400\u00a0mi) to attend it.[193] She is also an ambassador for the Galapagos Conservation Trust.[194] In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit[195][196] as an addition to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 and the only one not written by Potter.[195] The book falls in the middle of the earlier series, rather than at the end, and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller.[197] In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.[197] In 2018, Thompson said she would like to write about 'what it\u2019s like being human now'.[198] Thompson was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to drama.[2]",

One of Britain's most acclaimed actresses, she often portrays enigmatic and matronly characters with a sense of wit, frequently in period dramas and literary adaptations. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, three BAFTA Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards.\nBorn in London to English actor Eric Thompson and Scottish actress Phyllida Law, Thompson was educated at Newnham College, University of Cambridge, where she became a member of the Footlights troupe. After appearing in several comedy programmes, she came to prominence in 1987 in two BBC TV series, Tutti Frutti and Fortunes of War, winning the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for her work in both series. Her first film role was in the 1989 romantic comedy The Tall Guy. In the early 1990s, she often collaborated with her then-husband, actor and director Kenneth Branagh. The pair became popular in the British media and co-starred in several films, including Dead Again (1991) and Much Ado About Nothing (1993).\nIn 1992, Thompson won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for the period drama Howards End. In 1993, she garnered dual Academy Award nominations for her roles in The Remains of the Day as the housekeeper of a grand household and In the Name of the Father as a lawyer. Thompson scripted and starred in Sense and Sensibility (1995), which earned her numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, which makes her the only person to receive Academy Awards for both acting and writing, and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress. In 2013, she received acclaim and several award nominations for her portrayal of author P.\u00a0L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks. Other notable film and television credits include the Harry Potter film series (2004\u20132011), Wit (2001), Love Actually (2003), Angels in America (2003), Nanny McPhee (2005), Stranger than Fiction (2006), Last Chance Harvey (2008), Men in Black 3 (2012), and the sequel Men in Black: International (2019), Brave (2012), Beauty and the Beast (2017), Late Night (2019), and the BBC/HBO series Years and Years (2019).\nThompson is married to actor Greg Wise, with whom she lives in London. They have one daughter. She is an activist in the areas of human rights and environmentalism[3] and has received criticism for her outspokenness. She has written two books adapted from The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours by Elizabeth II for her services to drama.\nThompson was born in Paddington,[4][a]\nLondon, on 15 April 1959.[6] Her mother is the Scottish actress Phyllida Law, while her English father, Eric Thompson, was involved in theatre, and was the writer\u2013narrator of the popular children's television series The Magic Roundabout.[7][8] Her godfather was the director and writer Ronald Eyre.[9][10] She has one sister, Sophie Thompson, who also works as an actress.[7]  The family lived in West Hampstead in north London,[8] and Thompson was educated at Camden School for Girls.[11] She spent much time in Scotland during her childhood and often visited Ardentinny, where her grandparents and uncle lived.[12]\nIn her youth, Thompson was intrigued by language and literature, a trait which she attributes to her father, who shared her love of words.[13] After successfully taking A levels in English, French and Latin,[14] and securing a scholarship,[15] she began studying for an English degree at Newnham College, Cambridge,[16] arriving in 1977. Thompson believes that it was inevitable that she would become an actress, commenting that she was \"surrounded by creative people and I don't think it would ever have gone any other way, really\".[17] While there, she had a \"seminal moment\" that turned her to feminism and inspired her to take up performing. She explained in an interview in 2007 how she discovered the book The Madwoman in the Attic, \"which is about Victorian female writers and the disguises they took on in order to express what they wanted to express. That completely changed my life.\"[18] She became a self-professed \"punk rocker\",[19] with short red hair and a motorbike, and aspired to be a comedian like Lily Tomlin.[18]\nAt Cambridge, Thompson was invited into Footlights, the university's prestigious sketch comedy troupe, by its president, Martin Bergman,[20] becoming its first female member.[21] Also in the troupe were fellow actors Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, and she had a romantic relationship with the latter.[22] Fry recalled that \"there was no doubt that Emma was going the distance. Our nickname for her was Emma Talented.\"[23]\nIn 1980, Thompson served as the Vice President of Footlights,[24] and co-directed the troupe's first all-female revue, Woman's Hour.[20] The following year, Thompson and her Footlights team won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for their sketch show The Cellar Tapes.[25] Thompson graduated with upper second-class honours.[26]\nIn 1982, Thompson's father died as a result of circulatory problems at the age of 53.[7] The actress has commented that this \"tore [the family] to pieces\",[27] and \"I can't begin to tell you how much I regret his not being around\".[28] She added, \"At the same time, it's possible that were he still alive I might never have had the space or courage to do what I've done\u00a0... I have a definite feeling of inheriting space. And power.\"[28]\nThompson had her first professional role in 1982, touring in a stage version of Not the Nine O'Clock News.[6] She then turned to television, where much of her early work came with her Footlights co-stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. The regional ITV comedy series  There's Nothing To Worry About! (1982) was their first outing, followed by the one-off BBC show The Crystal Cube (1983).[29] There's Nothing to Worry About! later returned as the networked sketch show Alfresco (1983\u201384), which ran for two series with Thompson, Fry, Laurie, Ben Elton, and Robbie Coltrane.[6][29] She later collaborated again with Fry and Laurie on the acclaimed BBC Radio 4 series Saturday Night Fry (1988).\nIn 1985, Thompson was cast in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl, co-starring Robert Lindsay. It provided a breakthrough in her career, as the production earned rave reviews.[6][30] She played the role of Sally Smith for 15 months, which exhausted the actress; she later remarked \"I thought if I did the fucking \"Lambeth Walk\" one more time I was going to fucking throw up.\"[23] At the end of 1985, she wrote and starred in her own one-off special for Channel 4, Emma Thompson: Up for Grabs.[31]\nThompson achieved another breakthrough in 1987,[6] when she had leading roles in two television miniseries: Fortunes of War, a World War II drama co-starring Kenneth Branagh, and Tutti Frutti, a dark-comedy about a Scottish rock band with Robbie Coltrane.[30] For these performances, Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress.[32] The following year, she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC, Thompson, but this was poorly received.[33] In 1989, she and Branagh\u2014who had formed a romantic relationship\u2014starred in a stage revival of Look Back in Anger, directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company.[30][34] Later that year, the pair starred in a televised version of the play.[6][34]\nThompson's first cinema appearance came in the romantic comedy The Tall Guy (1989), the feature-film debut from screenwriter Richard Curtis.[30] It starred Jeff Goldblum as a West End actor, and Thompson played the nurse with whom he falls in love. The film was not widely seen,[35] but Thompson's performance was praised in The New York Times, where Caryn James called her \"an exceptionally versatile comic actress\".[36] She next turned to Shakespeare, appearing as Princess Katherine in Branagh's screen adaptation of Henry V (1989). The film was released to great critical acclaim.[37]\nThompson and Branagh are considered by American writer and critic James Monaco to have led the \"British cinematic onslaught\" in the 1990s.[38] She continued to experiment with Shakespeare in the new decade, appearing with Branagh in his stage productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and King Lear.[30][34] Reviewing the latter, the Chicago Tribune praised her \"extraordinary\" performance of the \"hobbling, stooped hunchback Fool\".[39] Thompson returned to cinema in 1991, playing a \"frivolous aristocrat\"[6] in Impromptu with Judy Davis and Hugh Grant.[40] and Thompson was nominated for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards.[41]  Her second release of 1991 was another pairing with Branagh, who also directed, in the Los Angeles-based noir Dead Again. She played a woman who has forgotten her identity.[42] Early in 1992, Thompson had a guest role in an episode of Cheers as Frasier Crane's first wife.[43]\nA turning point in Thompson's career[30] came when she was cast opposite Anthony Hopkins and Vanessa Redgrave in the Merchant Ivory period drama Howards End (1992), based on the novel by E. M. Forster. The film explored the social class system in Edwardian England, with Thompson playing an idealistic, intellectual, forward-looking woman who comes into association with a privileged and deeply conservative family. She actively pursued the role by writing to director James Ivory, who agreed to an audition and then gave her the part.[44]  According to the critic Vincent Canby, the film allowed Thompson to \"[come] into her own\", away from Branagh.[45] Upon release, Roger Ebert wrote that she was \"superb in the central role: quiet, ironic, observant, with steel inside\".[46] Howards End was widely praised,[47] a \"surprise hit\",[48] and received nine Academy Award nominations.[49] Among its three wins was the Best Actress trophy for Thompson, who was also awarded a Golden Globe and BAFTA for her performance.[6] Reflecting on the role, The New York Times writes that the actress \"found herself an international success almost overnight\".[6]\nFor her next two films, Thompson returned to working with Branagh. In Peter's Friends (1992), the pair starred with Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Imelda Staunton, and Tony Slattery as a group of Cambridge alumni who are reunited ten years after graduating. The comedy was positively reviewed,[50] and Desson Howe of The Washington Post wrote that Thompson was its highlight: \"Even as a rather one-dimensional character, she exudes grace and an adroit sense of comic tragedy.\"[51] She followed this with Branagh's screen version of Much Ado About Nothing (1993). The couple starred as Beatrice and Benedick, alongside a cast that also included Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, and Michael Keaton. Thompson was widely praised for the on-screen chemistry with Branagh and the natural ease with which she played the role[52][53] marking another critical success for Thompson.[54] Her performance earned a nomination for Best Female Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards.[41]\nThompson reunited with Merchant\u2013Ivory and Anthony Hopkins to film The Remains of the Day (1993), a film which has been described as a \"classic\" and the production team's definitive film.[55][56] Based on Kazuo Ishiguro's novel about a housekeeper and butler in interwar Britain, the story is acclaimed for its study of loneliness and repression, though Thompson was particularly interested in looking at \"the deformity that servitude inflicts upon people\", since her grandmother had worked as a servant and made many sacrifices.[57] She has named the film as one of the greatest experiences of her career, considering it to be a \"masterpiece of withheld emotion\".[58] The Remains of the Day was a critical and commercial success,[55] receiving eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and a second Best Actress nod for Thompson.[59]\nAlong with her Best Actress nomination at the 66th Academy Awards, Thompson was also nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category, making her the eighth performer in history to be nominated for two Oscars in the same year.[60] It came for her role as the lawyer Gareth Peirce in In the Name of the Father (1993), a drama about the Guildford Four starring Daniel Day-Lewis. The film was her second hit of the year, earning $65\u00a0million and critical praise, and was nominated for Best Picture along with The Remains of the Day.[61][62]\nIn 1994, Thompson made her Hollywood debut playing a goofy doctor alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in the blockbuster Junior. Although the male pregnancy storyline was poorly received by most critics and flopped at the box office,[63] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the lead trio.[64] She returned to independent cinema for a lead role in Carrington, which studied the platonic relationship between artist Dora Carrington and writer Lytton Strachey (played by Jonathan Pryce). Roger Ebert remarked that Thompson had \"developed a specialty in unrequited love\",[65] and the TV Guide Film &amp; Video Companion commented that her \"neurasthenic mannerisms, which usually drive us batty, are appropriate here\".[66]\nThompson's Academy success continued with Sense and Sensibility (1995), generally considered to be the most popular and authentic of the numerous film adaptations of Jane Austen's novels made in the 1990s.[67][68][69] Thompson\u2014a lifelong lover of Austen's work\u2014was hired to write the film based on the period sketches in her series Thompson.[70] She spent five years developing the screenplay,[71] and took the role of the spinster sister Elinor Dashwood despite, at age 35, being 16 years older than the literary character.[72] Directed by Ang Lee and co-starring Kate Winslet, Sense and Sensibility received widespread critical praise and ranks among the highest-grossing films of Thompson's career.[73][74] Shelly Frome remarked that she displayed a \"great affinity for Jane Austen's style and wit\",[75] and Graham Fuller of Sight and Sound saw her as the film's auteur.[76] Thompson received a third nomination for Best Actress and won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay, making her the only person in history to win an Oscar for both acting and screenwriting.[77] She also earned a second BAFTA Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.[6]\nThompson was absent from screens in 1996, but returned the following year with Alan Rickman's directorial debut, The Winter Guest. Set over one day in a Scottish seaside village, the drama allowed Thompson and her mother (Phyllida Law) to play mother and daughter on screen.[78] She then returned to America to appear in an episode of Ellen, and her self-parodying performance received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[30][79]\nFor her second Hollywood role, Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols's Primary Colors (1998), playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton.[80] Thompson's character, Susan, is described as that of an \"ambitious, long-suffering wife\" who has to deal with her husband's infidelity.[81] The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office.[82][83] According to Kevin O'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror, Americans were \"blown away\" by her performance and accent, and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her.[84] Thompson rejected many of the offers, expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards, and stated \"LA is lovely as long as you know you can leave\". She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point, which influenced her decision to leave film for a year.[85] Thompson followed Primary Colors by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller Judas Kiss (1998).[86]\nWhen she became a mother in 1999, Thompson made a conscious decision to reduce her workload, and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles.[57][87] She was not seen on screen again until 2000, with only a small part in the British comedy Maybe Baby, which she appeared in as a favour to its director, her friend Ben Elton.[88]\nFor the HBO television film Wit (2001), however, Thompson happily took the lead role in what she felt was \"one of the best scripts to have come out of America\".[89] Adapted from Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play, it focuses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project, and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right.[90]  She was greatly drawn to the \"daredevil\" role,[91] for which she had no qualms about shaving her head.[92] Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by \"the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect\", and in 2008 he called it Thompson's finest work.[93] Caryn James of The New York Times also described it as \"one of her most brilliant performances\", adding \"we seem to be peering into a soul as embattled as its body.\"[94] The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes, Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards.\nThompson's only credit of 2002 was a vocal performance in Disney's Treasure Planet, an adaptation of Treasure Island, where she voiced Captain Amelia. The animation earned far less than its large budget and was considered a \"box office disaster\".[95] This failure was countered the following year by one of Thompson's biggest commercial successes, Richard Curtis's romantic comedy Love Actually.[74] As part of an ensemble cast that included Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, and Colin Firth, she played a middle-class wife who suspects her husband (played by Alan Rickman) of infidelity. The scene in which her stalwart character breaks down was described by one critic as \"the best crying on screen ever\",[57] and in 2013, Thompson mentioned that she gets commended for this role more than any other.[96] She explained, \"I've had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer.\"[97] Her performance received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress.[98]\nThompson continued with supporting roles in the 2003 drama Imagining Argentina, where she played a dissident-journalist abducted by the country's 1970s dictatorial regime. Antonio Banderas played the husband who tries to find her, in a film that most critics disliked.[99] The film was booed and jeered at when it was screened at the Venice Film Festival and received a scathing article in The Guardian.[100] Thompson had greater success that year when she worked with HBO for a second time in the acclaimed miniseries Angels in America (2003).[30] The show, also featuring Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, dealt with the AIDS epidemic in Reagan-era America. Thompson played three roles\u00a0\u2013 a nurse, a homeless woman, and the title role of The Angel of America\u00a0\u2013 and was again nominated for an Emmy Award.[79] In 2004, she played the eccentric Divination teacher Sybill Trelawney in the third Harry Potter film, the Prisoner of Azkaban, her character described as a \"hippy chick professor who teaches fortune-telling\".[101] She later reprised her role in the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and the Deathly Hallows\u00a0\u2013 Part 2 (2011),[30] and has called her time on the popular franchise \"great fun\".[57]\n\u2014Thompson on Nanny McPhee and its sequel, which she wrote and starred in.[57]\nThe year 2005 saw the release of a project Thompson had been working on for nine years.[57] Loosely based on the Nurse Matilda stories that she read as a child, Thompson wrote the screenplay for the children's film Nanny McPhee\u00a0\u2013 which centres on a mysterious, unsightly nanny who must discipline a group of children. She also took the lead role, alongside Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury, in what was a highly personal project.[57][102] The film was a success, taking number one at the UK box office and earning $122\u00a0million worldwide.[103][104] Commenting on Thompson's screenplay, film critic Claudia Puig wrote that its \"well-worn storybook features are woven effectively into an appealing tale of youthful empowerment\".[105] The following year, Thompson appeared in the surreal American comedy\u2013drama Stranger than Fiction, playing a novelist whose latest character (played by Will Ferrell) is a real person who hears her narration in his head. Reviews for the film were generally favourable.[106]\nFollowing a brief, uncredited role in the post-apocalyptic blockbuster I Am Legend (2007),[107] Thompson played the devoutly Catholic Lady Marchmain in a 2008 film adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film,[108] but several picked Thompson out as its highlight.[109][110] Mark Kermode said \"Emma Thompson is to some extent becoming the new Judi Dench, as the person who kind of comes in for 15 minutes and is brilliant\u00a0... [but then] when she goes away, the rest of the movie has a real problem living up to the wattage of her presence\".[111] Thompson was further acclaimed for her work in the London-based romance Last Chance Harvey (2008), where she and Dustin Hoffman played a lonely, middle-aged pair who cautiously begin a relationship. Critics praised the chemistry between the two leads, and both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances.[112][113] Thompson's two 2009 films were both set in 1960s England, and in both she made cameo appearances: as a headmistress in the critically praised drama An Education[114] and as a \"tippling mother\" in Richard Curtis's The Boat that Rocked.[115]\nFive years after the original, Thompson returned to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during World War II. Building on the first film's success, it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was widely seen as an improvement.[116][117] The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship.[118] Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.[79]\nIn 2012, Thompson made a rare appearance in a big-budget Hollywood film[57] when she played the head Agent in Men in Black 3\u00a0\u2013 a continuation of the popular sci-fi comedy franchise starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. With a worldwide gross of $624\u00a0million, MIB3 is Thompson's biggest commercial hit outside of the Harry Potter films.[74] This mainstream success continued with the Pixar film Brave, in which Thompson voiced Elinor\u00a0\u2013 the Scottish queen despairing at her daughter's defiance against tradition.[30]  It was her second consecutive blockbuster release, and critics were generally kind to the film.[74][119] Also in 2012, Thompson played Queen Elizabeth II in an episode of Playhouse Presents, which dramatised an incident in 1982 when an intruder broke into the Queen's bedroom.[120] Her first film of 2013 was the fantasy romance Beautiful Creatures, in which she played an evil mother. The film aimed to capitalise on the success of The Twilight Saga, but was poorly reviewed and a box office disappointment.[121][122] Film critic Peter Travers was critical of Thompson's performance and \"outrageously awful Southern accent\", and feared \"the damage this crock may do to [her] reputation\".[123]\nConversely, her next appearance was so successful that it led one journalist to write \"Emma Thompson is back, firing on all cylinders.\"[124] Saving Mr. Banks depicted the making of Mary Poppins, and starred Thompson as P.\u00a0L. Travers, curmudgeonly author of the source novel. The actress considered it to be the best script she had read in years and was delighted to be offered the role. She considered it to be the most challenging of her career because she had \"never really played anyone quite so contradictory or difficult before\", but found the inconsistent and complicated character \"a blissful joy to embody\".[57][125] The film was well-received, grossed $112\u00a0million worldwide, and Thompson's performance garnered critical acclaim.[124][126] The review in The Independent expressed thanks that her \"playing of Travers is so deft that we instantly warm to her, and forgive her her snobbery\",[127] while Total Film's critic felt that Thompson brought depth to the \"predictable\" film with \"her best performance in years\".[128] Thompson was nominated for Best Actress at the BAFTAs, SAGs and Golden Globes, and received the Lead Actress trophy from the National Board of Review. Her Angels in America co-star Meryl Streep stated that she was \"shocked\" over Thompson's failure to receive an Academy Award nomination for the film.[129]\nThe romantic-comedy The Love Punch (2013) gave Thompson her second consecutive leading role, where she played half of a divorced couple who reunite to steal the man's ex-boss's jewellery.[130] In March 2014, she made her first stage appearance in 24 years\u00a0\u2013 and her New York debut\u00a0\u2013 in a Lincoln Center production of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. She appeared in the musical for five nights, and her \"playful\" performance of Mrs Lovett was highly praised; the critic Kayla Epstein wrote that she \"not only held her own against more experienced vocalists, but wound up running off with the show\".[131] She received her sixth Emmy nomination for the televised version of the show.[132] In 2014, Thompson provided the narration for the film Men, Women &amp; Children,[133]\nThe period drama Effie Gray, a project that she had been working on for many years, based on the true-life story of John Ruskin's disastrous marriage, was written by Thompson but became the subject of a copyright suit before being cleared for cinemas. The American playwright Gregory Murphy said that Thompson's screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay The Countess, which he claimed he had submitted to Thompson through a mutual friend in 2003 to consider the role of Elizabeth Eastlake in a proposed film of his play, and to Thompson's husband Greg Wise through a casting director to consider the role of John Ruskin in the play's 2005 West End production.[134] In 2008, Thompson announced that she and Wise \"had written a script together about John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic, which we want to make into a film.\"[135] After meeting with Thompson and her producers, Potboiler Productions, Murphy was offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson in settlement of his claim.[136] This settlement offer was later abandoned by Thompson, Greg Wise and their partner Donald Rosenfeld, when their company Sovereign Films took over production of the film and instigated the suit, creating the independent entity Effie Film, LLC, spearheaded by Rosenfeld, to litigate it.[137][138]  In March 2013, District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence from which Murphy claimed \"some of the most troubling material\" had been removed,[139] ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were \"quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events\".[140][141] In response to Murphy's attorney's concerns that the completed film Effie Gray would not adhere to Thompson's second revised screenplay, Judge Griesa concluded his ruling by saying that Thompson's film would not infringe Murphy's play or screenplay \"only to the extent that it does not substantially deviate from the November 29, 2011 screenplay,\" the date of Thompson's second revised screenplay.[142] In May 2013, Effie Gray's Cannes Film Festival premiere was cancelled. In October 2013, the film was withdrawn from the Mill Valley Film Festival in California due to \"unforeseen circumstances\" according to producer Rosenfeld.[143][144] In December 2013, Thompson said of the still unreleased Effie Gray that its \"time has probably passed,\" comparing it to another project of hers that \"didn't happen either.\"[145] Effie Gray was released in October 2014, to a modest reception.[146] Thompson plays Elizabeth Eastlake and Greg Wise plays John Ruskin. They both declined to promote the film.[147][148] Camilla Long, reviewing Effie Gray in The Sunday Times, wrote \"nothing fits together\" and \"no one seems to know why they made this film. Where is Thompson's passion and commitment, or any hint of what she intended to achieve.\"[149] Manohla Dargis in her review in The New York Times called Effie Gray \"The cinematic equivalent of a Brazilian wax, the movie omits much of the story's most interesting material to create something that's been smoothly denatured.\"[150]\nThompson's first film of 2015 was A Walk in the Woods, a comedy adapted from the book by Bill Bryson. She next starred in The Legend of Barney Thomson. Her role was a 77-year-old foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, Glaswegian former prostitute, the mother of the title character. Neither film was a critical success, although the latter received some positive reviews and Empire magazine wrote that Thomson was \"unforgettable\".[151][152][153] Later that year, she had a supporting role in the restaurant-based film Burnt. In 2016, she starred in the World War II-drama Alone in Berlin, based on the story of Otto and Elise Hampel. She also co-wrote the screenplay for Bridget Jones's Baby and appeared in the film as a doctor.\nIn 2017, Thompson appeared as Mrs. Potts (played by Angela Lansbury in the 1991 animated film) in Disney's live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon and starring her Harry Potter co-star Emma Watson in the lead role.[154] It grossed $1.2\u00a0billion worldwide, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of all time. She also had a supporting role as a hippy in the Noah Baumbach-directed dramedy The Meyerowitz Stories, which played in competition at Cannes and received critical acclaim.[155] She followed it with a starring role in the film The Children Act, a drama about a family who refuse cancer treatment for their son based on religious beliefs. She had a cameo role as Queen Elizabeth I in the 2017 Christmas special of the BBC sitcom Upstart Crow. In 2018, she provided the voiceover for Greenpeace's palm-oil awareness commercial which Iceland picked to promote as their 2018 Christmas advertisement. The commercial was rejected by the advertising organization Clearcast due to Greenpeace's alleged involvement in politics, thus violating their code of conduct.[156][157]\nIn 2019, Thompson starred in a leading role in Late Night, which was written by Mindy Kaling (who also co-starred in that film) and featured her as a popular TV host who hires a new writer to keep the show from getting replaced.[158] The film received positive reviews, with Thompson being singled out for praise, and Owen Gleiberman of Variety remarked that \"Thompson truly seems like a born talk-show host. Even when she's just riffing, she grounds Late Night in something real.\"[159] She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.[160] In the same year, she voiced as the Yeti Elder in the stop-motion animated film Missing Link, reprised her role as Agent O in a more substantial part in Men in Black: International, and co-produced and co-starred in the festive romantic comedy Last Christmas which was based on the song of the same name by George Michael, and was written by Thompson, her husband Greg Wise, and Bryony Kimmings.[161]\nThompson is widely regarded as one of the finest actresses of her generation[162][163] and one of Britain's most recognisable actresses, accepted in Hollywood.[164][165] Early in her career, when she was closely associated with her first husband Kenneth Branagh, she was somewhat unpopular and considered a \"luvvy\".[165] The public warmed to her after the separation, and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s.[165][166] Her status has continued to grow; in 2008, journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience,[163] and Mark Kermode said of her performances, \"There is something about her which is\u00a0\u2014 you just trust her. You just think 'I'm in proper hands here.'\u00a0... She's up there with the great, I mean really great, British female performers\".[111]\n\u00a0\u2013 Thompson on her approach to acting[167]\nThompson is particularly known for playing reticent women,[168] and Sands describes her as \"the best actress of our times on suffering borne with poignant dignity\".[163] According to Kate Kellaway of The Guardian, she specialises in playing \"a good woman in a frock\".[167] She also plays many haughty characters, with a \"bracing, nanny-like demeanour\",[23] but she is noted for her ability to win the empathy of audiences.[120][168] Thompson belongs to a group of highly decorated British actresses including Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham Carter who are known for appearing in \"heritage films\" and typically showing \"restraint, rendering emotions through intellect rather than feelings, and a sense of irony, which demonstrates the heroine's superior understanding\".[169][170] Projecting a typically \"British image\",[165] Thompson's often dogmatic and tight-jawed manner has also been compared to that of Maggie Smith.[171]\nWith a background in comedy, Thompson's performances are typically delivered with an ironic touch. Ang Lee, director of Sense and Sensibility stated that Thompson's comedic approach may be her greatest asset as an actress, remarking, \"Emma is an extremely funny lady. Like Austen, she's laughing at her own culture while she's a part of it.\"[171] Thompson has stated that the \"most moving things are often also funny, in life and in art\" which is present in her film work.[17] She often brings her real personality to her roles, and Kellaway believes that her lack of conventional beauty contributes to her likeability as an actress.[163][167]\nThompson, although born in London, has stated she feels Scottish: \"not only because I am half Scottish but also because I've spent half my life here\".[12] She frequently returns to Scotland and visits Dunoon in Argyll and Bute, where she owns a home.\nThompson's first husband was the actor and director Kenneth Branagh, whom she met in 1987 while filming the television series Fortunes of War.[172] The couple married in 1989 and proceeded to appear in several films together, with Branagh often casting her in his own productions.[173] Dubbed a \"golden couple\" by the British media,[172] the relationship received considerable press interest.[8] The pair attempted to keep their relationship private, refusing to be interviewed or photographed together.[174] In September 1995, Thompson and Branagh announced that they had separated; their statement to the press blamed their work schedules, but it later emerged that he was having an affair with actress Helena Bonham Carter.[97]\nThompson was living alone as the relationship with Branagh deteriorated, and entered into clinical depression.[27] While filming Sense and Sensibility in 1995, she began a relationship with her co-star Greg Wise. Commenting on how she was able to overcome her depression, she told BBC Radio 4, \"Work saved me and Greg saved me. He picked up the pieces and put them together again.\"[27] The couple have a daughter, Gaia, a pregnancy that was achieved through IVF treatment when Thompson was 39.[8]\nIn 2003, Thompson and Wise were married in Dunoon.[175] The family's permanent residence is in West Hampstead, London, on the same road as her childhood home.[8] Also in 2003, Thompson and her husband informally adopted a Rwandan orphan and former child soldier named Tindyebwa Agaba. They met at a Refugee Council event when he was 16, and she invited him to spend Christmas at their home.[8] \"Slowly\", Thompson has commented, \"he became a sort of permanent fixture, came on holiday to Scotland with us, became part of the family.\"[176] Agaba became a British citizen in 2009.[177]\nThompson has said of her religious views:\nI'm an atheist\u00a0... I regard religion with fear and suspicion. It's not enough to say that I don't believe in God. I actually regard the system as distressing: I am offended by some of the things said in the Bible and the Qur'an and I refute them.[178]\nShe is politically liberal and a supporter of the Labour Party; she told the BBC Andrew Marr Show in 2010 that she had been a member of the party \"all my life\".[179] Thompson endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in both the 2015[180] and 2016 Labour Party leadership elections.[181] She has also expressed support for the Women's Equality Party.[182]\nThompson has been a campaigner since her youth.[183] Since becoming a public figure she has regularly voiced her views and been involved in many issues, prompting criticism that she is overly outspoken.[183] In 2010, The Daily Telegraph asked: \"Emma Thompson: a national treasure or Britain's most annoying woman?\"[184] She has justified her assertiveness by saying, \"what I feel is that we all need to speak up and a woman who has got a louder voice needs to shout very loudly indeed.\"[183]\nShe is particularly active in human rights work.[167] As an ambassador for the charity ActionAid she has travelled to Uganda, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Liberia, Burma and South Africa.[185] She is chair of the Helen Bamber Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture,[186] a patron of the Refugee Council,[187] and has a therapy room in her office for traumatised refugees.[167] Thompson is also an activist for Palestinians, having been a member of the British-based ENOUGH! coalition that seeks to end the \"Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank\".[188] She is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation,[189] and in 2009 Time named her a \"European Hero\" in recognition of \"her work to highlight the plight of AIDS sufferers in Africa\".[183]\nThompson is also an active environmentalist. She is a supporter of Greenpeace, and in January 2009, as part of her campaign against climate change, she and three other members of the organisation bought land near the village of Sipson to deter the building of a third runway for Heathrow Airport.[190] In August 2014, Thompson and her daughter, Gaia, went on a Greenpeace \"Save the Arctic\" expedition to raise awareness of the dangers of drilling for oil.[191] She narrated The Real News Network's The Doubt Machine: Inside the Koch Brothers' War on Climate Science, a documentary short about Koch Industries and its efforts to discredit climate research.[192] The film was released on 31 October 2016. In 2019, she supported the London Extinction Rebellion rally against climate change, although she  received some criticism for having flown 8,700 kilometres (5,400\u00a0mi) to attend it.[193] She is also an ambassador for the Galapagos Conservation Trust.[194]\nIn 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit[195][196] as an addition to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 and the only one not written by Potter.[195] The book falls in the middle of the earlier series, rather than at the end, and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller.[197] In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.[197]\nIn 2018, Thompson said she would like to write about 'what it\u2019s like being human now'.[198]\nThompson was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to drama.[2]\n</body></html>"

He has a bachelor of arts degree in literature and a bachelor of education degree. After graduating, he worked as a teacher in Vancouver, British Columbia.[6] He started studying engineering at Montreal's \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 2002 but dropped out in 2003.[7][8] Beginning in 2004, he took one year of a master's program in environmental geography at McGill University but left without graduating in 2005.[9][8][7] He has also held jobs including camp counselor,[10] nightclub bouncer,[11][12][10] and snowboard instructor.[10][13] In the 2008 federal election, he was elected to represent the riding of Papineau in the House of Commons. In 2009, he was appointed the Liberal Party's critic for youth and multiculturalism, and the following year, became critic for citizenship and immigration. In 2011, he was appointed as critic for secondary education and sport. Trudeau won the leadership of the Liberal Party in April 2013 and led his party to victory in the 2015 federal election, moving the third-placed Liberals from 36 seats to 184 seats, the largest-ever numerical increase by a party in a federal election.[14][15] Winning the most seats (157) in the 2019 federal election, the Liberals formed a minority government while losing the popular vote, receiving the lowest percentage of the national popular vote of any governing party in Canadian history.[16] On June 23, 1971, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) announced that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's wife of four months, the former Margaret Sinclair,[17] was pregnant and due in December.[18][19] Justin Trudeau was born on Christmas Day 1971 at 9:27\u00a0pm EST at the Ottawa Civic Hospital.[20] He is the second child in Canadian history to be born to a prime minister in office; the first was John A. Macdonald's daughter Margaret Mary Theodora Macdonald (February 8, 1869\u00a0\u2013 January 28, 1933). Trudeau's younger brothers Alexandre (Sacha) (born December 25, 1973) and Michel (October 2, 1975\u00a0\u2013 November 13, 1998) were the third and fourth.[21][22] Trudeau is predominantly of Scottish and French Canadian descent. His grandfathers were businessman Charles-\u00c9mile Trudeau[23] and Scottish-born James Sinclair,[24] who served as Minister of Fisheries in the cabinet of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent.[25] Trudeau's maternal great-grandfather Thomas Bernard was born in Makassar[26] and immigrated to Penticton, British Columbia, in 1906 at age 15 with his family.[27] Through the Bernard family, kinsmen of the Earls of Bandon,[28][29][30] Trudeau is the 5th-great grandson of Major-General William Farquhar,[31] a leader in the founding of modern Singapore; Trudeau also has remote ethnic Malaccan[32][33] and Ono Niha[34][35][36] ancestry. Trudeau was baptized with his father's niece Anne Rouleau-Danis as godmother and his mother's brother-in-law Thomas Walker as godfather[37][38] at Ottawa's Notre Dame Basilica on the afternoon of January 16, 1972, which marked his first public appearance.[39] On April 14, 1972, Trudeau's father and mother hosted a gala at the National Arts Centre, at which visiting U.S. president Richard M. Nixon said, \"I'd like to toast the future prime minister of Canada, to Justin Pierre Trudeau\" to which Pierre Elliott Trudeau responded that should his son ever assume the role, he hoped he would have \"the grace and skill of the president\".[40] Earlier that same day U.S. first lady Pat Nixon had come to see him in his nursery to deliver a gift, a stuffed toy Snoopy.[41][42] Nixon's White House audio tapes later revealed Nixon referred to that visit as \"wasting three days up there. That trip we needed like a hole in the head.\"[43][44] His parents publicly announced their separation on May 27, 1977,[45][46] when Trudeau was five years old, with his father having custody. There had been repeated rumours of a reconciliation in the public for many years afterwards,[47] but his mother's attorney Michael Levine[48] filed in Toronto to the Supreme Court of Ontario for a no-fault divorce on November 16, 1983,[49] and finalized on April 2, 1984,[50] with his father publicly announcing his intention to retire as prime minister on February 29 of that year.[51] Eventually his parents came to an amicable joint-custody arrangement and learned to get along quite well. Interviewed in October 1979, his nanny Dianne Lavergne was quoted, \"Justin is a mommy's boy, so it's not easy, but children's hurts mend very quickly. And they're lucky kids, anyway.\"[52] Of his mother and father's marriage, Trudeau said in 2009, \"They loved each other incredibly, passionately, completely. But there was 30 years between them and my mom never was an equal partner in what encompassed my father's life, his duty, his country.\"[53] Trudeau has three half-siblings, Kyle and Alicia, from his mother's remarriage to Fried Kemper,[54] and Sarah, from his father's relationship with Deborah Coyne.[55] Trudeau lived at 24 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, the official residence of Canada's prime minister, from his birth until his father's government was defeated in the federal election on May 22, 1979. The Trudeaus were expected to move into the residence of the Leader of the Official Opposition, Stornoway, at 541 Acacia Avenue in Rockcliffe Park, but because of flooding in the basement, prime minister Joe Clark offered them Harrington Lake, the prime minister's official country retreat in Gatineau Park, with the expectation they would move into Stornoway at the start of July.[56] However, the repairs were not complete so Pierre Trudeau took a prolonged vacation with his sons to the Nova Scotia summer home of his friend, MP Don Johnston, and later sent his sons to stay with their maternal grandparents in North Vancouver for the rest of the summer while he slept at his friend's Ottawa apartment. Justin and his brothers returned to Ottawa for the start of the school year, but lived only on the top floor of Stornoway while repairs continued on the bottom floor.[57] His mother purchased and moved into a new home nearby at 95 Queen Victoria Avenue in Ottawa's New Edinburgh in September 1979.[58][59] The Trudeaus returned to the prime minister's official residence in February 1980 after the election that returned his father to the Prime Minister's Office.[60] His father had intended Trudeau to begin his formal education at a French Lyc\u00e9e, but Trudeau's mother convinced his father of the importance of sending their sons to a public school.[61] In the end, Trudeau was enrolled in 1976 in the French immersion program at Rockcliffe Park Public School, the same school his mother had attended for 2 years when her family relocated to Rockcliffe Park while her father served as a federal Cabinet minister.[62] He could have been dropped off by limousine, but his parents elected he take the school bus albeit with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police car following.[63][64][65][66] This was followed by one year at the private Lyc\u00e9e Claudel d'Ottawa.[67][68] After his father's retirement in June 1984, his mother remained at her New Edinburgh home while the rest of the family moved into his father's home at 1418 Pine Avenue, Montreal known as Cormier House[69] where the following autumn he began attending the private Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf, his father's alma mater. The school had begun as a Jesuit school but was non-denominational by the time Justin matriculated.[70][71] In 2008, Trudeau said that of all his early family outings he enjoyed camping with his father the most, because \"that was where our father got to be just our father\u00a0\u2013 a dad in the woods\".[72] During the summers his father would send him and his brothers to Camp Ahmek, on Canoe Lake, in Algonquin Provincial Park, where he would later work in his first paid employment as a camp counselor.[68][73][74][75][76] Trudeau and his brothers were given shares in a numbered trust fund by their father, from which they receive regular dividends. As of August 2011, Trudeau's company had assets of $1.2 million.[77] Trudeau has a bachelor of arts degree in literature from McGill University and a bachelor of education degree from the University of British Columbia. In his first year at McGill, Trudeau became acquainted with his future Principal Secretary Gerald Butts, through their mutual friend, Jonathan Ablett.[78] Butts invited Trudeau to join the McGill Debating Union.[79] They bonded while driving back to Montreal after a debate tournament at Princeton University[78] in which the Princeton team included Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator, who was a candidate for the U.S. Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2016.[80] After graduation, Trudeau stayed in Vancouver where he became a substitute teacher at local schools and worked permanently as a French and math teacher at the private West Point Grey Academy. He became a roommate at the Douglas Lodge[81] with fellow West Point Grey Academy faculty member and friend Christopher Ingvaldson.[78][82] From 2002 to 2004, he studied engineering at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, a part of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.[83] He started a master's degree in environmental geography at McGill, but withdrew from the program to seek public office among other reasons.[84] In August 2000, Justin Trudeau attended the Kokanee Summit in Creston, British Columbia, to raise funds in honour of his brother Michel Trudeau and other avalanche victims. After the event, an unsigned editorial in the Creston Valley Advance (a local newspaper) accused Trudeau of having groped an unnamed female reporter while at the music festival. The editorial stated Trudeau provided a \"day-late\" apology to the reporter, saying, \"If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward\".[85][86] In 2018, Trudeau was questioned about the groping incident but said he did not remember any negative incidents from that time. His apology and later statement about the event have been described as hypocritical, while responses to the story have been described as a witch hunt or non-story.[87] Trudeau, then 28, emerged as a prominent figure in October 2000, after delivering a eulogy at his father's state funeral.[88][89][90] The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) received numerous calls to rebroadcast the speech after its initial transmission, and leading Quebec politician Claude Ryan described it as \"perhaps\u00a0... the first manifestation of a dynasty\".[91] A book issued by the CBC in 2003 included the speech in its list of significant Canadian events from the past fifty years.[92] In 2007, Trudeau starred in the two-part CBC Television miniseries The Great War, which gave an account of Canada's participation in the First World War. He portrayed his fifth cousin, twice removed,[93] Major Talbot Mercer Papineau, who was killed on October 30, 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele.[94] Trudeau is one of several children of former prime ministers who have become Canadian media personalities. The others are Ben Mulroney (son of Brian Mulroney), Catherine Clark (daughter of Joe Clark), and Trudeau's younger brother, Alexandre.[95] Ben Mulroney was a guest at Trudeau's wedding.[96] Trudeau and his family started the Kokanee Glacier Alpine Campaign for winter sports safety in 2000, two years after his brother Michel died in an avalanche during a ski trip.[97] In 2002, Trudeau criticized the Government of British Columbia's decision to stop its funding for a public avalanche warning system.[98] Trudeau chaired the Katimavik youth program, a project started by longtime family friend Jacques H\u00e9bert, from 2002 to 2006.[99][100] In 2002\u201303, Trudeau was a panelist on CBC Radio's Canada Reads series, where he championed The Colony of Unrequited Dreams by Wayne Johnston.[101][102] Trudeau and his brother Alexandre inaugurated the Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Toronto in April 2004; the centre later became a part of the Munk School of Global Affairs.[103] In 2006, he hosted the Giller Prize for literature.[104][105] In 2005, Trudeau fought against a proposed $100-million zinc mine that he argued would poison the Nahanni River, a United Nations World Heritage Site located in the Northwest Territories. He was quoted as saying, \"The river is an absolutely magnificent, magical place. I'm not saying mining is wrong\u00a0... but that is not the place for it. It's just the wrong thing to be doing.\"[106][107] On September 17, 2006, Trudeau was the master of ceremonies at a Toronto rally organized by Rom\u00e9o Dallaire that called for Canadian participation in resolving the Darfur crisis.[108][109][110] Trudeau supported the Liberal Party from a young age, offering his support to party leader John Turner in the 1988 federal election.[111] Two years later, he defended Canadian federalism at a student event at the Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf, which he attended.[112] Following his father's death, Trudeau became more involved with the Liberal Party throughout the 2000s. Along with Olympian Charmaine Crooks, he co-hosted a tribute to outgoing prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien at the party's 2003 leadership convention, and was appointed to chair a task force on youth renewal after the party's defeat in the 2006 federal election.[113][114] In October 2006, Trudeau criticized Quebec nationalism by describing political nationalism generally as an \"old idea from the 19th century\", \"based on a smallness of thought\" and not relevant to modern Quebec. This comment was seen as a criticism of Michael Ignatieff, then a candidate in the 2006 Liberal Party leadership election, who was promoting recognition of Quebec as a nation.[115][116] Trudeau later wrote a public letter on the subject, describing the idea of Quebec nationhood as \"against everything my father ever believed\".[117][118] Trudeau announced his support for leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy shortly before the 2006 convention and introduced Kennedy during the candidates' final speeches.[119] When Kennedy dropped off after the second ballot, Trudeau joined him in supporting the ultimate winner, St\u00e9phane Dion.[120][121] Rumours circulated in early 2007 that Trudeau would run in an upcoming by-election in the Montreal riding of Outremont. The Montreal newspaper La Presse reported despite Trudeau's keenness, Liberal leader St\u00e9phane Dion wanted Outremont for a star candidate who could help rebuild the Liberal Party. Instead, Trudeau announced that he would seek the Liberal nomination in the nearby riding of Papineau for the next general election.[122][123][124] The riding, which had once been held for 26 years by Andr\u00e9 Ouellet, a senior minister under his father, had been in Liberal hands for 53 years before falling to the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in 2006.[125] On April 29, 2007, Trudeau won the Liberal party's nomination, picking up 690 votes to 350 for Deros and 220 for Giordano against Mary Deros, a Montreal city councillor and Basilio Giordano, the publisher of a local Italian-language newspaper.[126] Prime Minister Stephen Harper called an election for October 14, 2008, by which time Trudeau had been campaigning for a year in Papineau. On election day, Trudeau narrowly defeated Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois incumbent Vivian Barbot.[127] Following his election win, Edward Greenspon, editor-in-chief of The Globe and Mail, noted that Trudeau would \"be viewed as few other rookie MPs are\u2014as a potential future Prime Minister\u2014and scrutinized through that lens\".[72] The Conservative Party won a minority government in the 2008 election, and Trudeau entered parliament as a member of the Official Opposition. Trudeau was the first member of the 40th Parliament of Canada to introduce a private member's motion, in which he called for a \"national voluntary service policy for young people\". The proposal won support from parliamentarians across party lines.[128] He later co-chaired the Liberal Party's April 2009 national convention in Vancouver, and in October of the same year he was appointed as the party's critic for multiculturalism and youth.[129] In September 2010, he was reassigned as critic for youth, citizenship, and immigration.[130] During that time, he criticized the government's legislation targeting human smuggling, which he argued would penalize the victims of smuggling.[131] Trudeau sparked controversy when it was revealed that he earned $1.3 million in public speaking fees from charities and school boards across Canada, $277,000 of which Trudeau received after becoming an MP.[132][133] He encouraged an increase of Canada's relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and sought more accessible immigration procedures for Haitians moving to Canada in the time of crisis. His own riding includes a significant Haitian community.[134] Trudeau was re-elected in Papineau in the 2011 federal election, as the Liberal Party fell to third-party standing in the House of Commons with only thirty-four seats. Ignatieff resigned as party leader immediately after the election, and rumours again circulated that Trudeau could run to become his successor. On this occasion, Trudeau said, \"I don't feel I should be closing off any options\u00a0... because of the history packaged into my name, a lot of people are turning to me in a way that\u00a0... to be blunt, concerns me.\"[135][136] Weeks after the election, Toronto MP Bob Rae was selected to serve as the interim leader until the party's leadership convention, which was later decided to be held in April 2013. Rae appointed Trudeau as the party's critic for Post Secondary Education, Youth and Amateur Sport.[137] After his re-election, he traveled the country hosting fundraisers for charities and the Liberal Party.[138][139][140][141] Trudeau wanted to take part in a charity boxing match on behalf of the cancer research fundraising event Fight for the Cure, but was having difficulty finding a Conservative opponent until Conservative senator Patrick Brazeau agreed when asked on Trudeau's behalf by their mutual hairdresser Stefania Capovilla.[142][143] The fight on March 31, 2012, in Ottawa at the Hampton Inn was broadcast live on Sun News with commentary by Ezra Levant and Brian Lilley and Trudeau won in the third round, the result considered an upset.[142][144] After Dion's resignation as Liberal leader in 2008, Trudeau's name was mentioned as a potential candidate with polls showing him as a favourite among Canadians for the position.[145][146] However, Trudeau did not enter the race and Ignatieff was named leader in December 2008.[147] After the party's poor showing in the 2011 election, Ignatieff resigned from the leadership and Trudeau was again seen as a potential candidate to lead the party.[148] Following the election, Trudeau said he was undecided about seeking the leadership;[149] months later on October 12 at Wilfrid Laurier University, he announced he would not seek the post because he had a young family.[150] When interim leader Rae, who was also seen as a frontrunner, announced he would not be entering the race in June 2012, Trudeau was hit with a \"tsunami\" of calls from supporters to reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership.[151] Opinion polling conducted by several pollsters showed that if Trudeau were to become leader the Liberal Party would surge in support, from a distant third place to either being competitive with the Conservative Party or leading them.[152] In July 2012, Trudeau stated that he would reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership and would announce his final decision at the end of the summer.[153][154] On September 26, 2012, multiple media outlets started reporting that Trudeau would launch his leadership bid the following week.[155][156] While Trudeau was seen as a frontrunner for the leadership of the Liberal Party, he was criticized for his perceived lack of substance.[157][158] During his time as a Member of Parliament, he spoke little on policy matters and it was not known where he stood on many issues such as the economy and foreign affairs.[159][160] Some strategists and pundits believed the leadership would be the time for Trudeau to be tested on these issues; however, there was also fear within the party that his celebrity status and large lead might deter other strong candidates from entering the leadership race.[161][162][163] On October 2, 2012, Trudeau held a rally in Montreal to launch his bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party.[164] The core people on his campaign team were considered longtime friends, and all in their 30s and 40s. His senior advisor was Gerald Butts, the former President of WWF-Canada who had previously served as principal secretary to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. Other senior aides included campaign manager Katie Telford, and policy advisors Mike McNeir and Robert Asselin, who had all worked for recent Liberal Party leaders.[165] His brother Alexandre also took a break from his documentary work to be a senior advisor on Trudeau's campaign.[166] During the leadership campaign three by-elections were held on November 26, 2012. The riding Calgary Centre was expected to be a three-way race between the Conservatives, Liberals and Green Party. A week before by-election day Sun Media reported on comments Trudeau had made in a 2010 interview with T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec, in which he said, \"Canada isn't doing well right now because it's Albertans who control our community and socio-democratic agenda.\" Trudeau's campaign advisor said that the comments were being brought up now because of the close race in Calgary Centre.[167] The following day, Trudeau apologized, saying he was wrong to use \"Alberta\" as \"shorthand\" in referring to Stephen Harper's government.[168] The Conservatives held onto Calgary Centre in the by-election by less than 1,200 votes. Liberal candidate Harvey Locke said he lost the by-election on his own and that comments made by Trudeau did not influence the outcome.[169] Fellow leadership candidate Marc Garneau, seen as Trudeau's main challenger in the race, criticized Trudeau for not releasing enough substantial policy positions. Garneau called on him to release more detailed policies before members and supporters begin to vote.[170] Garneau later challenged Trudeau to a one-on-one debate, and said that if Trudeau could not defend his ideas in a debate against him, he wouldn't be able to do so against Prime Minister Harper.[171] Trudeau clashed in debates with challenger Joyce Murray, who was the only Liberal leadership candidate to speak out strongly in favour of electing the House of Commons with a system of proportional representation. She challenged Trudeau over his support for a preferential ballot voting system.[172] On March 13, 2013, Garneau dropped out of the leadership race, saying that polling conducted by his campaign showed he would be unable to defeat Trudeau.[173][174] With Joyce Murray, the last challenger, receiving significant press time, more Liberal politicians and public figures declared themselves for Trudeau. Trudeau was declared the winner of the leadership election on April 14, 2013, garnering 80.1 per cent of 30,800 votes.[175] Joyce Murray finished in second place with 10.2 per cent points, ahead of Martha Hall Findlay's 5.7 per cent.[176] Trudeau had lost only five ridings, all to Murray and all in BC.[177] Polls conducted during the leadership race showed that support for the Liberals would surge if they were led by Trudeau. Days after winning his party's leadership a poll showed that the Liberal Party was the choice of 43 per cent of respondents. This compared to 30 per cent for the governing Conservatives and 19 per cent for the Official Opposition New Democrats.[179] According to an October 2013 EKOS poll, Trudeau's approval numbers improved to a 48\u201329 approval\u2013disapproval; Thomas Mulcair's jumped to a slight lead at 50\u201325, while Stephen Harper's ratings sank to 24\u201369.[180] A December 2013 EKOS poll showed the Liberals preferred by 32.1 per cent of voters, the Conservatives by 26.2 per cent, the NDP 22.9 per cent. Likely voters, estimated by removing those who didn't vote in 2011, moved the parties into a logjam: Liberals 29.1 per cent, Conservatives 28.5 per cent, NDP 27.2 per cent.[181] In 2013, Justin Trudeau chose to give up his seat at the funeral of Nelson Mandela, in deference to Irwin Cotler as representative of the Liberal Party of Canada, because of Cotler's work for and with Nelson Mandela in fighting apartheid.[182] During the leadership campaign Trudeau pledged to park all his assets, exclusive of real estate holdings, into a blind trust which is atypical for opposition MPs, including leaders. According to documents obtained by the Ottawa Citizen, he fulfilled the pledge in July 2013 when the blind trust was set up by BMO Private Banking.[183] On January 27, 2014, Trudeau and MP Carolyn Bennett escorted Chrystia Freeland into the House of Commons, as is traditional for by-election victors.[184] Trudeau launched an internet video the week before the 2014 Liberal party convention titled \"An economy that benefits us all\" in which he narrates his economic platform. He said that Canada's debt to GDP ratios have come down in recent years and now it's time for Ottawa to \"step up\".[185] On October 19, 2015, after the longest official campaign in over a century, Trudeau led the Liberals to a decisive victory in the federal election. The Liberals won 184 of the 338 seats, with 39.5% of the popular vote, for a strong majority government;[186][187] a gain of 150 seats compared to the 2011 federal election.[186] This was the second-best performance in the party's history. The Liberals won mostly on the strength of a solid performance in the eastern half of the country. In addition to taking all of Atlantic Canada and Toronto,[186] they won 40 seats in Quebec\u2014the most that the Liberals had won in that province since Trudeau's father led them to a near-sweep of the province in 1980, and also the first time since then that the Liberals won a majority of Quebec's seats in an election. The 150-seat gain was the biggest numerical increase for a single party since Confederation, and marked the first time that a party had rebounded from third place in the Commons to a majority government. In addition to the appeal of his party's platform, Trudeau's success has been credited to his performance both on the campaign trail and televised leaders' debates exceeding the lowered expectations created by Conservative advertisements and conservative media outlets.[188][189][190] Trudeau declared victory shortly after CBC News projected that he had won a majority government. He began his speech with a reference to Wilfrid Laurier's \"sunny ways\" (French: voies ensoleill\u00e9es) approach to bringing Canadians together despite their differences. According to Trudeau, Laurier \"knew that politics can be a positive force, and that's the message Canadians have sent today\".[191] Harper announced his resignation as the head of the Conservative Party that night.[192][193] Prime Minister of Canada Leader of the Liberal Party Common Ground (memoir) Trudeau and the rest of the Cabinet were sworn in by Governor General David Johnston on November 4, 2015. He said that his first legislative priority was to lower taxes for middle-income Canadians and raise taxes for the top one per cent of income earners after parliament was reconvened on December 3, 2015.[194] Trudeau also issued a statement promising to rebuild relations with indigenous people and run an open, ethical and transparent government.[195] On November 5, 2015, during the first Liberal caucus meeting since forming a majority government, the party announced that it would reinstate the mandatory long-form census that had been scrapped in 2010, effective with the 2016 census.[196][197] In January 2017, Canada's Ethics Commissioner, Mary Dawson, began an investigation into Trudeau for a vacation he and his family took to Aga Khan IV's private island in the Bahamas.[198][199] The Ethics Commissioner's report, released in December 2017, found that Trudeau had violated four provisions of the Conflict of Interest Act.[200] He became the first sitting prime minister to break federal conflict of interest rules.[201] In February 2018, Trudeau was criticized when his administration invited Khalistani nationalist Jaspal Atwal to the Canadian High Commission's dinner party in Delhi. Atwal had previously been convicted for the shooting and attempted murder of Indian Cabinet Minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu in 1986, as well as the assault on former B.C. Premier Ujjal Dosanjh in 1985. Following the dinner, the PMO rescinded the invitation, and apologized for the incident.[202][203][204][205] In July 2019, a group of 20 independent academics published an assessment on Trudeau's tenure as prime minister,[206] called Assessing Justin Trudeau's Liberal Government: 353 Promises and a Mandate for Change. The assessment found that Trudeau's Liberal government kept 92 per cent of pledges, a sum of complete and partial pledges. When calculating completed and realized pledges, they found Trudeau's government kept 53.5 per cent of their campaign promises. Trudeau's government, along with the \"last Harper government had the highest rates of follow-through on their campaign promises of any Canadian government over the last 35 years,\" according to the assessment.[207][208] Trudeau has stated that he wishes to form a party that is \"resolutely pro-choice\" and that potential Liberal candidates in the 2015 election who are anti-abortion would not be greenlighted for the nomination if they did not agree to vote pro-choice on abortion bills.[209] This stance was in line with a resolution passed by a majority of Liberal party members at its 2012 policy convention.[209] Trudeau's stance was criticized by conservative Catholics, with former MP Jim Karygiannis saying it will \"definitely hurt the party\",[210] and Toronto cardinal Thomas Collins writing to Trudeau urging him to reverse his ruling,[211] leading Trudeau to defend the position.[212] During the election, the Liberal Party promised to run a deficit of around $10\u00a0billion per year, but Trudeau's Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, announced in his first budget in March 2016 that the government would have a $29\u00a0billion deficit in 2016 and 2017.[213] During the campaign prior to the 2015 federal election, Trudeau promised to eliminate the current voting system by the next federal election.[214] Called \"first-past-the-post\" or \"single-member plurality\",[215] this system awards the House of Commons seat in any electoral district to the candidate who received the most votes in that electoral riding, and the party with the most seats forms the government.[216] Consequently, it is possible for a political party to form a majority government with around 40 per cent of the popular vote across Canada.[214] Trudeau has said that he advocates a system where the distribution of seats is more in line with the popular vote on a Canada-wide basis, to be achieved by a new type of ballot that allows voters to rank the candidates in order of preference.[217] However, Trudeau has said that he is open to proportional representation, which is more likely to produce coalition governments.[214][216] In December 2015, the government announced that an all-party parliamentary committee would be formed in early 2016 to consider other options. During a discussion of the plan, Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef referred to it as \"an open and robust process of consultation\". However, she refused to commit to the Conservative Party's demand for a public referendum that would allow Canadians to vote on their preferred electoral system, indicating that she does not want to \"prejudice the outcome of that consultation process\".[218] There was some controversy regarding the government's initial plans for the Special Committee on Electoral Reform, as the Liberals announced that they would have a majority of the committee's ten seats. Trudeau and Monsef subsequently altered their plans, ceding a majority of the seats to the opposition. Trudeau acknowledged the opposition's concerns that \"we were perhaps behaving in a way that was resembling more the previous government than the kind of approach and tone that we promised throughout the electoral campaign\", and stated they changed course to show otherwise.[219] On February 1, 2017, the newly appointed Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould announced that the government had abandoned the electoral reform project and it was no longer a priority in her mandate letter from Trudeau.[220] In the letter, Trudeau wrote that \"a clear preference for a new electoral system, let alone a consensus, has not emerged\" and that \"without a clear preference or a clear question, a referendum would not be in Canada's interest\".[221] On February 10, 2017, at a townhall in Yellowknife, Trudeau admitted he had \"turned his back\" on the promise to reform the electoral system.[222][223] In 2017, the Liberal government announced Canada will welcome nearly one million immigrants over the next three years. The number of migrants will climb to 310,000 in 2018, up from 300,000 in 2017. That number will rise to 330,000 in 2019 then 340,000 in 2020.[224][225][226] Trudeau met with hundreds of chiefs at the Assembly of First Nations on December 7, 2015, and laid out his philosophy and commitments to Canada's indigenous people, to assure their \"constitutionally guaranteed rights\u00a0... a sacred obligation\". In brief,[227] he promised to rescind government policies that are in conflict with their rights, make a significant investment in education programs, increase general funding, and launch an enquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. Trudeau also indicated that the new government would implement all of the recommendations made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.[228][229] Trudeau has previously said that he would respect a First Nations community's wishes regarding pipeline construction on their territory.[230] Some First Nations leaders, including a councillor for the Squamish First Nation and prominent Mi\u2019kmaw lawyer Pam Palmater have stated that they believe Trudeau's purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline violates this promise.[230][231] During the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau said that if made prime minister, he would implement an infrastructure plan worth $60 billion (US$42 billion) in spending over 10 years.[232] Following his electoral win, in 2016, the Trudeau announced a 12-year, $180 billion (US$143 billion) infrastructure plan, with a focus on public transport, infrastructure in rural communities and Canada's northern regions, green infrastructure and affordable housing.[233] The Trudeau government also is setting up an infrastructure bank to fund projects.[234] Trudeau first publicly expressed an interest in the legalization of marijuana while speaking at a rally in Kelowna, B.C. on June 24, 2013. He told a crowd, \"I'm actually not in favour of decriminalizing cannabis. I'm in favour of legalizing it. Tax it, regulate. It's one of the only ways to keep it out of the hands of our kids because the current war on drugs, the current model is not working. We have to use evidence and science to make sure we're moving forward on that.\"[235] In an interview in August 2013, Trudeau said that the last time he had used marijuana was in 2010, after he had become a Member of Parliament: \"We had a few good friends over for a dinner party, our kids were at their grandmother's for the night, and one of our friends lit a joint and passed it around. I had a puff.\"[236][237][238] After analysing the results of the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, Trudeau reiterated his position in favour of the legalization in Canada, saying that Canadians would benefit from analysing the experiences of both Colorado and the state of Washington.[239] After the Liberal party formed the government in November 2015, with Trudeau as prime minister, he announced that a federal-provincial-territorial process was being created to discuss a jointly suitable process for the legalization of marijuana possession for recreational purposes. The plan is to remove marijuana consumption and incidental possession from the Criminal Code; however, new laws will be enacted for greater punishment of those convicted of supplying pot to minors and for impairment while driving a motor vehicle.[240] By late November 2015, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that she and the ministers of Health and Public Safety were working on specifics as to the legislation.[241] In April 2016, the Trudeau government announced that it would aim to introduce legislation to legalize cannabis in Spring 2017.[242] The legislation to legalize cannabis for recreational use (Cannabis Act, Bill C-45) was passed by the House of Commons of Canada in late November 2017; it passed second reading in the Senate of Canada on March 22, 2018.[243] On June 18, 2018, the House passed the bill with most, but not all, of the Senate's amendments.[244] The Senate accepted this version of the Act the following day.[245] Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the next day that recreational use of cannabis would no longer violate criminal law as of October 17, 2018.[246] As of October 17, 2018, cannabis is legal in Canada for both recreational and medicinal use. On October 17, the first day of legalization, the Government of Canada announced that it intends to grant pardons to Canadians convicted of simple cannabis possession charges.[247] Trudeau has expressed opposition towards the proposed Quebec Charter of Values, a controversial charter in that province and elsewhere that among other things prohibited public sector employees from wearing or displaying \"conspicuous\" religious symbols, justifying that it would make the people of Quebec \"choose between their freedom of religion and freedom of expression, freedom of conscience and their economic well-being and their acceptance in the workplace. That for me is a real concern.\"[248] Trudeau has long advocated changes that would make the Senate of Canada a less partisan house. In January 2014, he announced a step that began reducing Senate partisanship by removing Liberal senators from the Liberal caucus.[249] On December 5, 2015, after his appointment as prime minister, the new government's democratic institutions minister, Maryam Monsef, with House leader Dominic LeBlanc, announced a major overhaul of the appointment process, as Trudeau had promised during the election campaign. The new system consists of five board members\u2014three federal appointees and two from the relevant province\u2014who will pick independent candidates, not officially affiliated with any political party, based on merit,[250] a similar concept to the Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments. The stated goal of the December 2015 reform, was to improve the effectiveness of the Senate which had been, according to Monsef, \"hampered by its reputation as a partisan institution\". She indicated that this reform would not require an amendment to the constitution. The advisory board was expected to have been appointed by the end of December 2015. The criteria for appointment to the Senate would be \"outstanding personal qualities that include integrity and ethics and experience in public life, community service or leadership in their field of expertise\". At the time of the announcement, there were 17 Senate vacancies and these were expected to be filled by the end of 2016.[251] On February 8, 2019, The Globe and Mail reported that sources close to the government said that the Prime Minister's Office had allegedly attempted to influence Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould concerning an ongoing prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. When asked about the allegations, Trudeau said that the story in the Globe was false and that he had never \"directed\" Wilson-Raybould concerning the case.[252] Wilson-Raybould did not comment on the matter, citing solicitor-client privilege.[253] Soon after, Trudeau voluntarily waived privilege and cabinet confidences, permitting her to speak.[254] On February 11, the Ethics Commissioner announced the opening of an investigation into the allegations. Trudeau said he \"welcomed the investigation\".[255][256] The Justice Committee of the House of Commons has conducted a series of hearings on the alleged interference.[257][258][259] The investigation heard from several witnesses, including Jody Wilson-Raybould, who submitted as evidence a telephone call she secretly recorded between herself and Privy Council Clerk, Michael Wernick, which was subsequently released to the public.[260] On the recording, Wernick is heard asking to understand why the \"DPA route\" is not being used, stating that people were \"talking past each other\", and suggesting Trudeau obtain independent legal advice from former Supreme Court Justice Beverly McLachlin. Wilson-Raybould is heard suggesting that Trudeau would be \"breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence\". On March 19, 2019, the Liberal committee members voted as a bloc to shut down the Justice Committee's investigation.[261] Trudeau was the subject of an investigation by Canada's Ethics Commissioner, pursuant to the Conflict of Interest Act, in regards to criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin in the SNC-Lavalin affair. The commission's final report, issued August 14, 2019, concluded \"Mr. Trudeau contravened section 9 of the Act\".[262][263][264][265][266] During the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau pledged to study the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) before making a final decision on ratification.[267] Trudeau said that Canadians should know what effects TPP would have on different industries, adding that he would hold an open and serious discussion with Canadians.[268] After the United States withdrew from the TPP, Canada joined the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which incorporates most of the provisions of the TPP and which entered into force on December 30, 2018.[269][270][271] Trudeau identifies as a feminist,[272] having stated, \"I am a feminist. I'm proud to be a feminist,\" although his claim of being a feminist has been disputed.[273] Trudeau has also stated that \"the Liberal Party is unequivocal in its defence of women's rights. We are the party of the Charter.\" After being sworn in as Prime Minister, when asked by a reporter why he felt gender parity was important when naming his cabinet, he replied, \"Because it's 2015.\"[274] More recently, he has similarly answered to feminist organizations on social media that \"On behalf of the Government of Canada, I am writing back to let you know that I wholeheartedly agree: Poverty is Sexist\".[275] In January 2018, in a speech at the World Economic Forum, Trudeau called for critical discussion on issues brought up by the Me Too movement.[276] Trudeau has also advocated a high standard and holds a \"zero tolerance for sexual assault, harassment or other forms of misconduct by his employees or caucus colleagues\".[277] As the leader of the Liberal Party, Trudeau initiated investigations on several Members of Parliament resulting in the dismissal of cabinet minister Kent Hehr, the resignation of MP Darshan Kang, and the suspension and later expulsion of MPs Scott Andrews and Massimo Pacetti.[278] In an interview, Trudeau explained that the zero tolerance standard applied to himself as well and stated, \"I've been very, very careful all my life to be thoughtful, to be respectful of people's space and people's headspace as well.\"[279] In the April 2019 Daughters of the Vote event organized by Equal Voice Canada in the House of Commons, many of its delegates turned their backs when Trudeau spoke as a protest for his actions of ousting former Cabinet Ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus (see SNC-Lavalin Affair).[280] On October 22, 2015, Trudeau stated that, once prime minister, he would end Canada's airstrike mission against ISIL.[281][282] In his mandate letter to Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, he also called for increased focus on Canadian trainers for local troops and humanitarian aid for the region.[283] On November 13, 2015, Trudeau was asked whether his plans to change Canada's contribution to the fight against ISIL and to repeal parts of Bill C-51 would change following the terrorist attacks in Paris. Trudeau responded, \"It's too soon to jump to conclusions, but obviously governments have a responsibility to keep their citizens safe, while defending our rights and freedoms, and that balance is something the Canadian government, and indeed all governments around the world, will be focusing on.\"[284][285][286] On June 14, 2016, Trudeau refused to recognize ISIS's atrocities as genocide, instead of waiting for an official position from the UN Security Council. He switched his position once the UN Commission released its inquiry on Syria.[287][288] Trudeau supported the Harper-negotiated arms deal with Saudi Arabia,[289] believed to be the largest arms sale in Canadian history.[290] Upon hearing the news of former President of Cuba Fidel Castro's passing, Trudeau released a statement that described Castro as a \"remarkable leader\" and a \"larger than life leader who served his people\".[291] In 2017, Trudeau criticized Executive Order 13769 entitled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\" signed by President Donald Trump. The executive order bans refugees from seven countries, six of which have Muslim majorities, from entering the United States. On social media, he displayed support for affected refugees.[292] In August 2018, Canada called for the immediate release of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi and his sister Samar. In response to Canada's criticism, Saudi Arabia expelled Canada's ambassador, and froze trade with Canada.[293] Trudeau said that Canada will \"continue to speak clearly and firmly on issues of human rights at home and abroad wherever we see the need\".[294] In September 2018, as the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar became ethnic cleansing against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority,[295] Canada has stripped Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi of her honorary Canadian citizenship.[296] In October 2018, Trudeau condemned the killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul and promised \"consequences\".[297] On September 11, 2019, Trudeau visited the Governor General, Julie Payette, to request the dissolution of Parliament (the act which launches an election).[298] Prior to the formal start of the election, Trudeau announced his intention to only participate in the three leaders' debates, two organized by the Leaders' Debates Commission, and one organized by TVA.[299] The Citytv/Maclean's debate was held on September 12, with an empty podium left on stage for Trudeau.[300][301][302] The Munk Debate on foreign policy was originally scheduled on October 1,[300] although its organizers cancelled the event as a result of Trudeau's decision to not attend.[303][304] In September 2019, controversial pictures and video were published showing Trudeau in brownface and blackface.[305] On September 18, 2019, Time magazine published a photograph of Trudeau wearing brownface makeup in the spring of 2001, at an Arabian Nights-themed gala, while Trudeau was a teacher at West Point Grey Academy.[306] Trudeau publicly apologized, agreeing the photo was racist and saying: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have known better and I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d [307] He further went on to say \"It was something that I didn\u2019t think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do\".[308] Trudeau also admitted to wearing blackface makeup in high school while singing \"Day-O\" at a talent show that was subsequently published by Global News.[309] A third instance, a video, of Trudeau in racist dress was also published.[310] After this video was published, Trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup.[311] In the days following the scandal, pollsters pointed out that many Canadians either were not bothered by the scandal or had accepted Trudeau's apology.[312][313][314][315] Additionally, minority community groups, racialized commentators and some of Trudeau's opponents came to his defense.[316][317][318][319] Others were more critical, including members of his own party.[320] Two official debates were organized and held by the newly created Leaders' Debates Commission.[321] The English language debate took place on October 7 and the French on October 10.[322][323] Both debates took place at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec.[322][324] Trudeau's Liberal Party won the most seats in the 2019 federal election, but the Party lost 20 seats in the House of Commons (lowering its total from 177 to 157) from the time of dissolution.[325] Nevertheless, the Liberals won enough seats to allow Trudeau to form a minority government.[326] For the first time since 1979, the party that garnered a large share of the national popular vote did not win the most seats\u2014Trudeau had 33.1 per cent of the popular vote, while conservative leader Andrew Scheer had 34.4 per cent.[327][328] It was also the first time a government took power with less than 35 per cent of the national popular vote since John A. Macdonald, in 1867, who had 34.8 per cent of the votes.[329] In Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Liberal party won 14 per cent and 10 per cent of the popular vote, respectively[330] while winning all 25 of the Toronto seats, including 24 of 29 seats in the surrounding suburbs of the Greater Toronto Area\u2014in part due to the conservative government in Ontario led by Doug Ford.[327][331] Trudeau first met Sophie Gr\u00e9goire when they were both children growing up in Montreal; Gr\u00e9goire was a classmate and childhood friend of Trudeau's youngest brother, Michel.[332] They reconnected as adults in June 2003, when Gr\u00e9goire, by then a Quebec television personality, was assigned as Trudeau's co-host for a charity ball; they began dating several months later. Trudeau and Gr\u00e9goire became engaged in October 2004, and married on May 28, 2005, in a Roman Catholic ceremony at Montreal's Sainte-Madeleine d'Outremont Church.[333] They have three children: Xavier James (born October 18, 2007),[334] Ella-Grace Margaret (born February 5, 2009)[335][336] and Hadrien Gr\u00e9goire (born February 28, 2014).[337][338] In June 2013, two months after Trudeau became the leader of the Liberal Party, the couple sold their home in the C\u00f4te-des-Neiges neighbourhood of Montreal.[339] They began living in a rented home in Ottawa's Rockcliffe Park, the neighbourhood near where Trudeau resided as a child during his father's time as prime minister.[339] On August 18, 2014, an intruder broke into the house while Gr\u00e9goire and the couple's three children were sleeping and left a threatening note; however, nothing was stolen and there was no damage to the property. Following the incident, Trudeau, who was in Winnipeg at the time of the break-in, stated his intention to inquire with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about his home security.[340] After his 2015 electoral victory, Trudeau opted to live at Rideau Cottage, on the grounds of Rideau Hall, until necessary repairs are completed at 24 Sussex to make it habitable.[341] Trudeau's physical appearance has been the subject of many international publications.[342][343] Trudeau has a large Earth inside a Haida raven tattoo on his left arm.[344] The tattoo is based on a design by Robert Davidson, a Haida artist whose grandmother ceremonially adopted Pierre Trudeau as an honorary member of the Haida tribe during a 1976 trip to what was then called the Queen Charlotte Islands.[345] Trudeau's father was a devout Roman Catholic[346] and his mother converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism just prior to their wedding.[347] As a child, Justin attended Mass each Sunday and said his prayers each night before bedtime. He became a lapsed Catholic at age 18, as he felt that much of his day-to-day life was not addressed by the formality and structure of the church.[66][348] Trudeau described his faith during this period as \"like so many Catholics across this country, I said, 'OK, I'm Catholic, I'm of faith, but I'm just not really going to go to church. Maybe on Easter, maybe midnight Mass at Christmas.'\"[66][348] After the death of his brother Michel in 1998, Trudeau was persuaded by a friend to participate in an Alpha course, during which he regained his faith.[66][348] In 2011, Trudeau stated, \"My own personal faith is an extremely important part of who I am and the values that I try to lead with.\"[349] *Each federal electoral district had 100 points, which were determined by the voters in the district.

He has a bachelor of arts degree in literature and a bachelor of education degree. After graduating, he worked as a teacher in Vancouver, British Columbia.[6] He started studying engineering at Montreal's \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 2002 but dropped out in 2003.[7][8] Beginning in 2004, he took one year of a master's program in environmental geography at McGill University but left without graduating in 2005.[9][8][7] He has also held jobs including camp counselor,[10] nightclub bouncer,[11][12][10] and snowboard instructor.[10][13]\nIn the 2008 federal election, he was elected to represent the riding of Papineau in the House of Commons. In 2009, he was appointed the Liberal Party's critic for youth and multiculturalism, and the following year, became critic for citizenship and immigration. In 2011, he was appointed as critic for secondary education and sport. Trudeau won the leadership of the Liberal Party in April 2013 and led his party to victory in the 2015 federal election, moving the third-placed Liberals from 36 seats to 184 seats, the largest-ever numerical increase by a party in a federal election.[14][15] Winning the most seats (157) in the 2019 federal election, the Liberals formed a minority government while losing the popular vote, receiving the lowest percentage of the national popular vote of any governing party in Canadian history.[16]\nOn June 23, 1971, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) announced that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's wife of four months, the former Margaret Sinclair,[17] was pregnant and due in December.[18][19] Justin Trudeau was born on Christmas Day 1971 at 9:27\u00a0pm EST at the Ottawa Civic Hospital.[20] He is the second child in Canadian history to be born to a prime minister in office; the first was John A. Macdonald's daughter Margaret Mary Theodora Macdonald (February 8, 1869\u00a0\u2013 January 28, 1933). Trudeau's younger brothers Alexandre (Sacha) (born December 25, 1973) and Michel (October 2, 1975\u00a0\u2013 November 13, 1998) were the third and fourth.[21][22]\nTrudeau is predominantly of Scottish and French Canadian descent. His grandfathers were businessman Charles-\u00c9mile Trudeau[23] and Scottish-born James Sinclair,[24] who served as Minister of Fisheries in the cabinet of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent.[25] Trudeau's maternal great-grandfather Thomas Bernard was born in Makassar[26] and immigrated to Penticton, British Columbia, in 1906 at age 15 with his family.[27] Through the Bernard family, kinsmen of the Earls of Bandon,[28][29][30] Trudeau is the 5th-great grandson of Major-General William Farquhar,[31] a leader in the founding of modern Singapore; Trudeau also has remote ethnic Malaccan[32][33] and Ono Niha[34][35][36] ancestry.\n\nTrudeau was baptized with his father's niece Anne Rouleau-Danis as godmother and his mother's brother-in-law Thomas Walker as godfather[37][38] at Ottawa's Notre Dame Basilica on the afternoon of January 16, 1972, which marked his first public appearance.[39] On April 14, 1972, Trudeau's father and mother hosted a gala at the National Arts Centre, at which visiting U.S. president Richard M. Nixon said, \"I'd like to toast the future prime minister of Canada, to Justin Pierre Trudeau\" to which Pierre Elliott Trudeau responded that should his son ever assume the role, he hoped he would have \"the grace and skill of the president\".[40] Earlier that same day U.S. first lady Pat Nixon had come to see him in his nursery to deliver a gift, a stuffed toy Snoopy.[41][42] Nixon's White House audio tapes later revealed Nixon referred to that visit as \"wasting three days up there. That trip we needed like a hole in the head.\"[43][44]\nHis parents publicly announced their separation on May 27, 1977,[45][46] when Trudeau was five years old, with his father having custody. There had been repeated rumours of a reconciliation in the public for many years afterwards,[47] but his mother's attorney Michael Levine[48] filed in Toronto to the Supreme Court of Ontario for a no-fault divorce on November 16, 1983,[49] and finalized on April 2, 1984,[50] with his father publicly announcing his intention to retire as prime minister on February 29 of that year.[51] Eventually his parents came to an amicable joint-custody arrangement and learned to get along quite well. Interviewed in October 1979, his nanny Dianne Lavergne was quoted, \"Justin is a mommy's boy, so it's not easy, but children's hurts mend very quickly. And they're lucky kids, anyway.\"[52] Of his mother and father's marriage, Trudeau said in 2009, \"They loved each other incredibly, passionately, completely. But there was 30 years between them and my mom never was an equal partner in what encompassed my father's life, his duty, his country.\"[53] Trudeau has three half-siblings, Kyle and Alicia, from his mother's remarriage to Fried Kemper,[54] and Sarah, from his father's relationship with Deborah Coyne.[55]\nTrudeau lived at 24 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, the official residence of Canada's prime minister, from his birth until his father's government was defeated in the federal election on May 22, 1979. The Trudeaus were expected to move into the residence of the Leader of the Official Opposition, Stornoway, at 541 Acacia Avenue in Rockcliffe Park, but because of flooding in the basement, prime minister Joe Clark offered them Harrington Lake, the prime minister's official country retreat in Gatineau Park, with the expectation they would move into Stornoway at the start of July.[56] However, the repairs were not complete so Pierre Trudeau took a prolonged vacation with his sons to the Nova Scotia summer home of his friend, MP Don Johnston, and later sent his sons to stay with their maternal grandparents in North Vancouver for the rest of the summer while he slept at his friend's Ottawa apartment. Justin and his brothers returned to Ottawa for the start of the school year, but lived only on the top floor of Stornoway while repairs continued on the bottom floor.[57] His mother purchased and moved into a new home nearby at 95 Queen Victoria Avenue in Ottawa's New Edinburgh in September 1979.[58][59] The Trudeaus returned to the prime minister's official residence in February 1980 after the election that returned his father to the Prime Minister's Office.[60]\nHis father had intended Trudeau to begin his formal education at a French Lyc\u00e9e, but Trudeau's mother convinced his father of the importance of sending their sons to a public school.[61] In the end, Trudeau was enrolled in 1976 in the French immersion program at Rockcliffe Park Public School, the same school his mother had attended for 2 years when her family relocated to Rockcliffe Park while her father served as a federal Cabinet minister.[62] He could have been dropped off by limousine, but his parents elected he take the school bus albeit with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police car following.[63][64][65][66] This was followed by one year at the private Lyc\u00e9e Claudel d'Ottawa.[67][68]\nAfter his father's retirement in June 1984, his mother remained at her New Edinburgh home while the rest of the family moved into his father's home at 1418 Pine Avenue, Montreal known as Cormier House[69] where the following autumn he began attending the private Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf, his father's alma mater. The school had begun as a Jesuit school but was non-denominational by the time Justin matriculated.[70][71] In 2008, Trudeau said that of all his early family outings he enjoyed camping with his father the most, because \"that was where our father got to be just our father\u00a0\u2013 a dad in the woods\".[72] During the summers his father would send him and his brothers to Camp Ahmek, on Canoe Lake, in Algonquin Provincial Park, where he would later work in his first paid employment as a camp counselor.[68][73][74][75][76]\nTrudeau and his brothers were given shares in a numbered trust fund by their father, from which they receive regular dividends.  As of August 2011, Trudeau's company had assets of $1.2 million.[77]\nTrudeau has a bachelor of arts degree in literature from McGill University and a bachelor of education degree from the University of British Columbia. In his first year at McGill, Trudeau became acquainted with his future Principal Secretary Gerald Butts, through their mutual friend, Jonathan Ablett.[78] Butts invited Trudeau to join the McGill Debating Union.[79] They bonded while driving back to Montreal after a debate tournament at Princeton University[78] in which the Princeton team included Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator, who was a candidate for the U.S. Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2016.[80] After graduation, Trudeau stayed in Vancouver where he became a substitute teacher at local schools and worked permanently as a French and math teacher at the private West Point Grey Academy. He became a roommate at the Douglas Lodge[81] with fellow West Point Grey Academy faculty member and friend Christopher Ingvaldson.[78][82] From 2002 to 2004, he studied engineering at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, a part of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.[83] He started a master's degree in environmental geography at McGill, but withdrew from the program to seek public office among other reasons.[84]\nIn August 2000, Justin Trudeau attended the Kokanee Summit in Creston, British Columbia, to raise funds in honour of his brother Michel Trudeau and other avalanche victims. After the event, an unsigned editorial in the Creston Valley Advance (a local newspaper) accused Trudeau of having groped an unnamed female reporter while at the music festival. The editorial stated Trudeau provided a \"day-late\" apology to the reporter, saying, \"If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward\".[85][86] In 2018, Trudeau was questioned about the groping incident but said he did not remember any negative incidents from that time. His apology and later statement about the event have been described as hypocritical, while responses to the story have been described as a witch hunt or non-story.[87]\nTrudeau, then 28, emerged as a prominent figure in October 2000, after delivering a eulogy at his father's state funeral.[88][89][90] The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) received numerous calls to rebroadcast the speech after its initial transmission, and leading Quebec politician Claude Ryan described it as \"perhaps\u00a0... the first manifestation of a dynasty\".[91] A book issued by the CBC in 2003 included the speech in its list of significant Canadian events from the past fifty years.[92]\nIn 2007, Trudeau starred in the two-part CBC Television miniseries The Great War, which gave an account of Canada's participation in the First World War. He portrayed his fifth cousin, twice removed,[93] Major Talbot Mercer Papineau, who was killed on October 30, 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele.[94] Trudeau is one of several children of former prime ministers who have become Canadian media personalities. The others are Ben Mulroney (son of Brian Mulroney), Catherine Clark (daughter of Joe Clark), and Trudeau's younger brother, Alexandre.[95] Ben Mulroney was a guest at Trudeau's wedding.[96]\nTrudeau and his family started the Kokanee Glacier Alpine Campaign for winter sports safety in 2000, two years after his brother Michel died in an avalanche during a ski trip.[97] In 2002, Trudeau criticized the Government of British Columbia's decision to stop its funding for a public avalanche warning system.[98]\nTrudeau chaired the Katimavik youth program, a project started by longtime family friend Jacques H\u00e9bert, from 2002 to 2006.[99][100]\nIn 2002\u201303, Trudeau was a panelist on CBC Radio's Canada Reads series, where he championed The Colony of Unrequited Dreams by Wayne Johnston.[101][102] Trudeau and his brother Alexandre inaugurated the Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Toronto in April 2004; the centre later became a part of the Munk School of Global Affairs.[103] In 2006, he hosted the Giller Prize for literature.[104][105]\nIn 2005, Trudeau fought against a proposed $100-million zinc mine that he argued would poison the Nahanni River, a United Nations World Heritage Site located in the Northwest Territories. He was quoted as saying, \"The river is an absolutely magnificent, magical place. I'm not saying mining is wrong\u00a0... but that is not the place for it. It's just the wrong thing to be doing.\"[106][107]\nOn September 17, 2006, Trudeau was the master of ceremonies at a Toronto rally organized by Rom\u00e9o Dallaire that called for Canadian participation in resolving the Darfur crisis.[108][109][110]\nTrudeau supported the Liberal Party from a young age, offering his support to party leader John Turner in the 1988 federal election.[111] Two years later, he defended Canadian federalism at a student event at the Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf, which he attended.[112]\nFollowing his father's death, Trudeau became more involved with the Liberal Party throughout the 2000s. Along with Olympian Charmaine Crooks, he co-hosted a tribute to outgoing prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien at the party's 2003 leadership convention, and was appointed to chair a task force on youth renewal after the party's defeat in the 2006 federal election.[113][114]\nIn October 2006, Trudeau criticized Quebec nationalism by describing political nationalism generally as an \"old idea from the 19th century\", \"based on a smallness of thought\" and not relevant to modern Quebec. This comment was seen as a criticism of Michael Ignatieff, then a candidate in the 2006 Liberal Party leadership election, who was promoting recognition of Quebec as a nation.[115][116] Trudeau later wrote a public letter on the subject, describing the idea of Quebec nationhood as \"against everything my father ever believed\".[117][118]\nTrudeau announced his support for leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy shortly before the 2006 convention and introduced Kennedy during the candidates' final speeches.[119] When Kennedy dropped off after the second ballot, Trudeau joined him in supporting the ultimate winner, St\u00e9phane Dion.[120][121]\nRumours circulated in early 2007 that Trudeau would run in an upcoming by-election in the Montreal riding of Outremont. The Montreal newspaper La Presse reported despite Trudeau's keenness, Liberal leader St\u00e9phane Dion wanted Outremont for a star candidate who could help rebuild the Liberal Party. Instead, Trudeau announced that he would seek the Liberal nomination in the nearby riding of Papineau for the next general election.[122][123][124] The riding, which had once been held for 26 years by Andr\u00e9 Ouellet, a senior minister under his father, had been in Liberal hands for 53 years before falling to the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in 2006.[125]\nOn April 29, 2007, Trudeau won the Liberal party's nomination, picking up 690 votes to 350 for Deros and 220 for Giordano against Mary Deros, a Montreal city councillor and Basilio Giordano, the publisher of a local Italian-language newspaper.[126]\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper called an election for October 14, 2008, by which time Trudeau had been campaigning for a year in Papineau. On election day, Trudeau narrowly defeated Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois incumbent Vivian Barbot.[127] Following his election win, Edward Greenspon, editor-in-chief of The Globe and Mail, noted that Trudeau would \"be viewed as few other rookie MPs are\u2014as a potential future Prime Minister\u2014and scrutinized through that lens\".[72]\nThe Conservative Party won a minority government in the 2008 election, and Trudeau entered parliament as a member of the Official Opposition. Trudeau was the first member of the 40th Parliament of Canada to introduce a private member's motion, in which he called for a \"national voluntary service policy for young people\". The proposal won support from parliamentarians across party lines.[128] He later co-chaired the Liberal Party's April 2009 national convention in Vancouver, and in October of the same year he was appointed as the party's critic for multiculturalism and youth.[129]\nIn September 2010, he was reassigned as critic for youth, citizenship, and immigration.[130] During that time, he criticized the government's legislation targeting human smuggling, which he argued would penalize the victims of smuggling.[131]\nTrudeau sparked controversy when it was revealed that he earned $1.3 million in public speaking fees from charities and school boards across Canada, $277,000 of which Trudeau received after becoming an MP.[132][133]\nHe encouraged an increase of Canada's relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and sought more accessible immigration procedures for Haitians moving to Canada in the time of crisis. His own riding includes a significant Haitian community.[134]\nTrudeau was re-elected in Papineau in the 2011 federal election, as the Liberal Party fell to third-party standing in the House of Commons with only thirty-four seats. Ignatieff resigned as party leader immediately after the election, and rumours again circulated that Trudeau could run to become his successor. On this occasion, Trudeau said, \"I don't feel I should be closing off any options\u00a0... because of the history packaged into my name, a lot of people are turning to me in a way that\u00a0... to be blunt, concerns me.\"[135][136] Weeks after the election, Toronto MP Bob Rae was selected to serve as the interim leader until the party's leadership convention, which was later decided to be held in April 2013. Rae appointed Trudeau as the party's critic for Post Secondary Education, Youth and Amateur Sport.[137] After his re-election, he traveled the country hosting fundraisers for charities and the Liberal Party.[138][139][140][141]\nTrudeau wanted to take part in a charity boxing match on behalf of the cancer research fundraising event Fight for the Cure, but was having difficulty finding a Conservative opponent until Conservative senator Patrick Brazeau agreed when asked on Trudeau's behalf by their mutual hairdresser Stefania Capovilla.[142][143] The fight on March 31, 2012, in Ottawa at the Hampton Inn was broadcast live on Sun News with commentary by Ezra Levant and Brian Lilley and Trudeau won in the third round, the result considered an upset.[142][144]\nAfter Dion's resignation as Liberal leader in 2008, Trudeau's name was mentioned as a potential candidate with polls showing him as a favourite among Canadians for the position.[145][146]\nHowever, Trudeau did not enter the race and Ignatieff was named leader in December 2008.[147] After the party's poor showing in the 2011 election, Ignatieff resigned from the leadership and Trudeau was again seen as a potential candidate to lead the party.[148]\nFollowing the election, Trudeau said he was undecided about seeking the leadership;[149] months later on October 12 at Wilfrid Laurier University, he announced he would not seek the post because he had a young family.[150] When interim leader Rae, who was also seen as a frontrunner, announced he would not be entering the race in June 2012, Trudeau was hit with a \"tsunami\" of calls from supporters to reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership.[151]\nOpinion polling conducted by several pollsters showed that if Trudeau were to become leader the Liberal Party would surge in support, from a distant third place to either being competitive with the Conservative Party or leading them.[152] In July 2012, Trudeau stated that he would reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership and would announce his final decision at the end of the summer.[153][154]\nOn September 26, 2012, multiple media outlets started reporting that Trudeau would launch his leadership bid the following week.[155][156] While Trudeau was seen as a frontrunner for the leadership of the Liberal Party, he was criticized for his perceived lack of substance.[157][158] During his time as a Member of Parliament, he spoke little on policy matters and it was not known where he stood on many issues such as the economy and foreign affairs.[159][160] Some strategists and pundits believed the leadership would be the time for Trudeau to be tested on these issues; however, there was also fear within the party that his celebrity status and large lead might deter other strong candidates from entering the leadership race.[161][162][163]\nOn October 2, 2012, Trudeau held a rally in Montreal to launch his bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party.[164] The core people on his campaign team were considered longtime friends, and all in their 30s and 40s. His senior advisor was Gerald Butts, the former President of WWF-Canada who had previously served as principal secretary to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. Other senior aides included campaign manager Katie Telford, and policy advisors Mike McNeir and Robert Asselin, who had all worked for recent Liberal Party leaders.[165] His brother Alexandre also took a break from his documentary work to be a senior advisor on Trudeau's campaign.[166]\nDuring the leadership campaign three by-elections were held on November 26, 2012. The riding Calgary Centre was expected to be a three-way race between the Conservatives, Liberals and Green Party. A week before by-election day Sun Media reported on comments Trudeau had made in a 2010 interview with T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec, in which he said, \"Canada isn't doing well right now because it's Albertans who control our community and socio-democratic agenda.\" Trudeau's campaign advisor said that the comments were being brought up now because of the close race in Calgary Centre.[167] The following day, Trudeau apologized, saying he was wrong to use \"Alberta\" as \"shorthand\" in referring to Stephen Harper's government.[168] The Conservatives held onto Calgary Centre in the by-election by less than 1,200 votes. Liberal candidate Harvey Locke said he lost the by-election on his own and that comments made by Trudeau did not influence the outcome.[169]\nFellow leadership candidate Marc Garneau, seen as Trudeau's main challenger in the race, criticized Trudeau for not releasing enough substantial policy positions. Garneau called on him to release more detailed policies before members and supporters begin to vote.[170] Garneau later challenged Trudeau to a one-on-one debate, and said that if Trudeau could not defend his ideas in a debate against him, he wouldn't be able to do so against Prime Minister Harper.[171] Trudeau clashed in debates with challenger Joyce Murray, who was the only Liberal leadership candidate to speak out strongly in favour of electing the House of Commons with a system of proportional representation. She challenged Trudeau over his support for a preferential ballot voting system.[172]\nOn March 13, 2013, Garneau dropped out of the leadership race, saying that polling conducted by his campaign showed he would be unable to defeat Trudeau.[173][174]\nWith Joyce Murray, the last challenger, receiving significant press time, more Liberal politicians and public figures declared themselves for Trudeau. Trudeau was declared the winner of the leadership election on April 14, 2013, garnering 80.1 per cent of 30,800 votes.[175] Joyce Murray finished in second place with 10.2 per cent points, ahead of Martha Hall Findlay's 5.7 per cent.[176] Trudeau had lost only five ridings, all to Murray and all in BC.[177]\nPolls conducted during the leadership race showed that support for the Liberals would surge if they were led by Trudeau. Days after winning his party's leadership a poll showed that the Liberal Party was the choice of 43 per cent of respondents. This compared to 30 per cent for the governing Conservatives and 19 per cent for the Official Opposition New Democrats.[179]\nAccording to an October 2013 EKOS poll, Trudeau's approval numbers improved to a 48\u201329 approval\u2013disapproval; Thomas Mulcair's jumped to a slight lead at 50\u201325, while Stephen Harper's ratings sank to 24\u201369.[180]\nA December 2013 EKOS poll showed the Liberals preferred by 32.1 per cent of voters, the Conservatives by 26.2 per cent, the NDP 22.9 per cent. Likely voters, estimated by removing those who didn't vote in 2011, moved the parties into a logjam: Liberals 29.1 per cent, Conservatives 28.5 per cent, NDP 27.2 per cent.[181]\nIn 2013, Justin Trudeau chose to give up his seat at the funeral of Nelson Mandela, in deference to Irwin Cotler as representative of the Liberal Party of Canada, because of Cotler's work for and with Nelson Mandela in fighting apartheid.[182]\nDuring the leadership campaign Trudeau pledged to park all his assets, exclusive of real estate holdings, into a blind trust which is atypical for opposition MPs, including leaders. According to documents obtained by the Ottawa Citizen, he fulfilled the pledge in July 2013 when the blind trust was set up by BMO Private Banking.[183]\nOn January 27, 2014, Trudeau and MP Carolyn Bennett escorted Chrystia Freeland into the House of Commons, as is traditional for by-election victors.[184] Trudeau launched an internet video the week before the 2014 Liberal party convention titled \"An economy that benefits us all\" in which he narrates his economic platform. He said that Canada's debt to GDP ratios have come down in recent years and now it's time for Ottawa to \"step up\".[185]\nOn October 19, 2015, after the longest official campaign in over a century, Trudeau led the Liberals to a decisive victory in the federal election. The Liberals won 184 of the 338 seats, with 39.5% of the popular vote, for a strong majority government;[186][187] a gain of 150 seats compared to the 2011 federal election.[186]\nThis was the second-best performance in the party's history. The Liberals won mostly on the strength of a solid performance in the eastern half of the country. In addition to taking all of Atlantic Canada and Toronto,[186] they won 40 seats in Quebec\u2014the most that the Liberals had won in that province since Trudeau's father led them to a near-sweep of the province in 1980, and also the first time since then that the Liberals won a majority of Quebec's seats in an election. The 150-seat gain was the biggest numerical increase for a single party since Confederation, and marked the first time that a party had rebounded from third place in the Commons to a majority government.\nIn addition to the appeal of his party's platform, Trudeau's success has been credited to his performance both on the campaign trail and televised leaders' debates exceeding the lowered expectations created by Conservative advertisements and conservative media outlets.[188][189][190]\nTrudeau declared victory shortly after CBC News projected that he had won a majority government. He began his speech with a reference to Wilfrid Laurier's \"sunny ways\" (French: voies ensoleill\u00e9es) approach to bringing Canadians together despite their differences. According to Trudeau, Laurier \"knew that politics can be a positive force, and that's the message Canadians have sent today\".[191] Harper announced his resignation as the head of the Conservative Party that night.[192][193]\nPrime Minister of Canada\nLeader of the Liberal Party\n\nCommon Ground (memoir)\nTrudeau and the rest of the Cabinet were sworn in by Governor General David Johnston on November 4, 2015. He said that his first legislative priority was to lower taxes for middle-income Canadians and raise taxes for the top one per cent of income earners after parliament was reconvened on December 3, 2015.[194] Trudeau also issued a statement promising to rebuild relations with indigenous people and run an open, ethical and transparent government.[195] On November 5, 2015, during the first Liberal caucus meeting since forming a majority government, the party announced that it would reinstate the mandatory long-form census that had been scrapped in 2010, effective with the 2016 census.[196][197]\nIn January 2017, Canada's Ethics Commissioner, Mary Dawson, began an investigation into Trudeau for a vacation he and his family took to Aga Khan IV's private island in the Bahamas.[198][199] The Ethics Commissioner's report, released in December 2017, found that Trudeau had violated four provisions of the Conflict of Interest Act.[200] He became the first sitting prime minister to break federal conflict of interest rules.[201]\nIn February 2018, Trudeau was criticized when his administration invited Khalistani nationalist Jaspal Atwal to the Canadian High Commission's dinner party in Delhi. Atwal had previously been convicted for the shooting and attempted murder of Indian Cabinet Minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu in 1986, as well as the assault on former B.C. Premier Ujjal Dosanjh in 1985. Following the dinner, the PMO rescinded the invitation, and apologized for the incident.[202][203][204][205]\nIn July 2019, a group of 20 independent academics published an assessment on Trudeau's tenure as prime minister,[206] called Assessing Justin Trudeau's Liberal Government: 353 Promises and a Mandate for Change. The assessment found that Trudeau's Liberal government kept 92 per cent of pledges, a sum of complete and partial pledges. When calculating completed and realized pledges, they found Trudeau's government kept 53.5 per cent of their campaign promises. Trudeau's government, along with the \"last Harper government had the highest rates of follow-through on their campaign promises of any Canadian government over the last 35 years,\" according to the assessment.[207][208]\nTrudeau has stated that he wishes to form a party that is \"resolutely pro-choice\" and that potential Liberal candidates in the 2015 election who are anti-abortion would not be greenlighted for the nomination if they did not agree to vote pro-choice on abortion bills.[209] This stance was in line with a resolution passed by a majority of Liberal party members at its 2012 policy convention.[209] Trudeau's stance was criticized by conservative Catholics, with former MP Jim Karygiannis saying it will \"definitely hurt the party\",[210] and Toronto cardinal Thomas Collins writing to Trudeau urging him to reverse his ruling,[211] leading Trudeau to defend the position.[212]\nDuring the election, the Liberal Party promised to run a deficit of around $10\u00a0billion per year, but Trudeau's Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, announced in his first budget in March 2016 that the government would have a $29\u00a0billion deficit in 2016 and 2017.[213]\nDuring the campaign prior to the 2015 federal election, Trudeau promised to eliminate the current voting system by the next federal election.[214] Called \"first-past-the-post\" or \"single-member plurality\",[215] this system awards the House of Commons seat in any electoral district to the candidate who received the most votes in that electoral riding, and the party with the most seats forms the government.[216] Consequently, it is possible for a political party to form a majority government with around 40 per cent of the popular vote across Canada.[214]\nTrudeau has said that he advocates a system where the distribution of seats is more in line with the popular vote on a Canada-wide basis, to be achieved by a new type of ballot that allows voters to rank the candidates in order of preference.[217] However, Trudeau has said that he is open to proportional representation, which is more likely to produce coalition governments.[214][216]\nIn December 2015, the government announced that an all-party parliamentary committee would be formed in early 2016 to consider other options. During a discussion of the plan, Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef referred to it as \"an open and robust process of consultation\". However, she refused to commit to the Conservative Party's demand for a public referendum that would allow Canadians to vote on their preferred electoral system, indicating that she does not want to \"prejudice the outcome of that consultation process\".[218]\nThere was some controversy regarding the government's initial plans for the Special Committee on Electoral Reform, as the Liberals announced that they would have a majority of the committee's ten seats. Trudeau and Monsef subsequently altered their plans, ceding a majority of the seats to the opposition. Trudeau acknowledged the opposition's concerns that \"we were perhaps behaving in a way that was resembling more the previous government than the kind of approach and tone that we promised throughout the electoral campaign\", and stated they changed course to show otherwise.[219]\nOn February 1, 2017, the newly appointed Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould announced that the government had abandoned the electoral reform project and it was no longer a priority in her mandate letter from Trudeau.[220] In the letter, Trudeau wrote that \"a clear preference for a new electoral system, let alone a consensus, has not emerged\" and that \"without a clear preference or a clear question, a referendum would not be in Canada's interest\".[221]\nOn February 10, 2017, at a townhall in Yellowknife, Trudeau admitted he had \"turned his back\" on the promise to reform the electoral system.[222][223]\nIn 2017, the Liberal government announced Canada will welcome nearly one million immigrants over the next three years. The number of migrants will climb to 310,000 in 2018, up from 300,000 in 2017. That number will rise to 330,000 in 2019 then 340,000 in 2020.[224][225][226]\nTrudeau met with hundreds of chiefs at the Assembly of First Nations on December 7, 2015, and laid out his philosophy and commitments to Canada's indigenous people, to assure their \"constitutionally guaranteed rights\u00a0... a sacred obligation\". In brief,[227] he promised to rescind government policies that are in conflict with their rights, make a significant investment in education programs, increase general funding, and launch an enquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. Trudeau also indicated that the new government would implement all of the recommendations made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.[228][229]\nTrudeau has previously said that he would respect a First Nations community's wishes regarding pipeline construction on their territory.[230] Some First Nations leaders, including a councillor for the Squamish First Nation and prominent Mi\u2019kmaw lawyer Pam Palmater have stated that they believe Trudeau's purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline violates this promise.[230][231]\nDuring the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau said that if made prime minister, he would implement an infrastructure plan worth $60 billion (US$42 billion) in spending over 10 years.[232] Following his electoral win, in 2016, the Trudeau announced a 12-year, $180 billion (US$143 billion) infrastructure plan, with a focus on public transport, infrastructure in rural communities and Canada's northern regions, green infrastructure and affordable housing.[233] The Trudeau government also is setting up an infrastructure bank to fund projects.[234]\nTrudeau first publicly expressed an interest in the legalization of marijuana while speaking at a rally in Kelowna, B.C. on June 24, 2013. He told a crowd, \"I'm actually not in favour of decriminalizing cannabis. I'm in favour of legalizing it. Tax it, regulate. It's one of the only ways to keep it out of the hands of our kids because the current war on drugs, the current model is not working. We have to use evidence and science to make sure we're moving forward on that.\"[235]\nIn an interview in August 2013, Trudeau said that the last time he had used marijuana was in 2010, after he had become a Member of Parliament: \"We had a few good friends over for a dinner party, our kids were at their grandmother's for the night, and one of our friends lit a joint and passed it around. I had a puff.\"[236][237][238] After analysing the results of the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, Trudeau reiterated his position in favour of the legalization in Canada, saying that Canadians would benefit from analysing the experiences of both Colorado and the state of Washington.[239]\nAfter the Liberal party formed the government in November 2015, with Trudeau as prime minister, he announced that a federal-provincial-territorial process was being created to discuss a jointly suitable process for the legalization of marijuana possession for recreational purposes. The plan is to remove marijuana consumption and incidental possession from the Criminal Code; however, new laws will be enacted for greater punishment of those convicted of supplying pot to minors and for impairment while driving a motor vehicle.[240] By late November 2015, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that she and the ministers of Health and Public Safety were working on specifics as to the legislation.[241] In April 2016, the Trudeau government announced that it would aim to introduce legislation to legalize cannabis in Spring 2017.[242]\nThe legislation to legalize cannabis for recreational use (Cannabis Act, Bill C-45) was passed by the House of Commons of Canada in late November 2017; it passed second reading in the Senate of Canada on March 22, 2018.[243] On June 18, 2018, the House passed the bill with most, but not all, of the Senate's amendments.[244] The Senate accepted this version of the Act the following day.[245] Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the next day that recreational use of cannabis would no longer violate criminal law as of October 17, 2018.[246] As of October 17, 2018, cannabis is legal in Canada for both recreational and medicinal use.\nOn October 17, the first day of legalization, the Government of Canada announced that it intends to grant pardons to Canadians convicted of simple cannabis possession charges.[247]\nTrudeau has expressed opposition towards the proposed Quebec Charter of Values, a controversial charter in that province and elsewhere that among other things prohibited public sector employees from wearing or displaying \"conspicuous\" religious symbols, justifying that it would make the people of Quebec \"choose between their freedom of religion and freedom of expression, freedom of conscience and their economic well-being and their acceptance in the workplace. That for me is a real concern.\"[248]\nTrudeau has long advocated changes that would make the Senate of Canada a less partisan house. In January 2014, he announced a step that began reducing Senate partisanship by removing Liberal senators from the Liberal caucus.[249]\nOn December 5, 2015, after his appointment as prime minister, the new government's democratic institutions minister, Maryam Monsef, with House leader Dominic LeBlanc, announced a major overhaul of the appointment process, as Trudeau had promised during the election campaign. The new system consists of five board members\u2014three federal appointees and two from the relevant province\u2014who will pick independent candidates, not officially affiliated with any political party, based on merit,[250] a similar concept to the Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments.\nThe stated goal of the December 2015 reform, was to improve the effectiveness of the Senate which had been, according to Monsef, \"hampered by its reputation as a partisan institution\". She indicated that this reform would not require an amendment to the constitution. The advisory board was expected to have been appointed by the end of December 2015. The criteria for appointment to the Senate would be \"outstanding personal qualities that include integrity and ethics and experience in public life, community service or leadership in their field of expertise\". At the time of the announcement, there were 17 Senate vacancies and these were expected to be filled by the end of 2016.[251]\nOn February 8, 2019, The Globe and Mail reported that sources close to the government said that the Prime Minister's Office had allegedly attempted to influence Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould concerning an ongoing prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. When asked about the allegations, Trudeau said that the story in the Globe was false and that he had never \"directed\" Wilson-Raybould concerning the case.[252] Wilson-Raybould did not comment on the matter, citing solicitor-client privilege.[253] Soon after, Trudeau voluntarily waived privilege and cabinet confidences, permitting her to speak.[254] On February 11, the Ethics Commissioner announced the opening of an investigation into the allegations. Trudeau said he \"welcomed the investigation\".[255][256] The Justice Committee of the House of Commons has conducted a series of hearings on the alleged interference.[257][258][259] The investigation heard from several witnesses, including Jody Wilson-Raybould, who submitted as evidence a telephone call she secretly recorded between herself and Privy Council Clerk, Michael Wernick, which was subsequently released to the public.[260] On the recording, Wernick is heard asking to understand why the \"DPA route\" is not being used, stating that people were \"talking past each other\", and suggesting Trudeau obtain independent legal advice from former Supreme Court Justice Beverly McLachlin. Wilson-Raybould is heard suggesting that Trudeau would be \"breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence\". On March 19, 2019, the Liberal committee members voted as a bloc to shut down the Justice Committee's investigation.[261]\nTrudeau was the subject of an investigation by Canada's Ethics Commissioner, pursuant to the Conflict of Interest Act, in regards to criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin in the SNC-Lavalin affair. The commission's final report, issued August 14, 2019, concluded \"Mr. Trudeau contravened section 9 of the Act\".[262][263][264][265][266]\nDuring the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau pledged to study the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) before making a final decision on ratification.[267] Trudeau said that Canadians should know what effects TPP would have on different industries, adding that he would hold an open and serious discussion with Canadians.[268]\nAfter the United States withdrew from the TPP, Canada joined the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which incorporates most of the provisions of the TPP and which entered into force on December 30, 2018.[269][270][271]\nTrudeau identifies as a feminist,[272] having stated, \"I am a feminist. I'm proud to be a feminist,\" although his claim of being a feminist has been disputed.[273] Trudeau has also stated that \"the Liberal Party is unequivocal in its defence of women's rights. We are the party of the Charter.\" After being sworn in as Prime Minister, when asked by a reporter why he felt gender parity was important when naming his cabinet, he replied, \"Because it's 2015.\"[274] More recently, he has similarly answered to feminist organizations on social media that \"On behalf of the Government of Canada, I am writing back to let you know that I wholeheartedly agree: Poverty is Sexist\".[275]\nIn January 2018, in a speech at the World Economic Forum, Trudeau called for critical discussion on issues brought up by the Me Too movement.[276] Trudeau has also advocated a high standard and holds a \"zero tolerance for sexual assault, harassment or other forms of misconduct by his employees or caucus colleagues\".[277] As the leader of the Liberal Party, Trudeau initiated investigations on several Members of Parliament resulting in the dismissal of cabinet minister Kent Hehr, the resignation of MP Darshan Kang, and the suspension and later expulsion of MPs Scott Andrews and Massimo Pacetti.[278] In an interview, Trudeau explained that the zero tolerance standard applied to himself as well and stated, \"I've been very, very careful all my life to be thoughtful, to be respectful of people's space and people's headspace as well.\"[279]\nIn the April 2019 Daughters of the Vote event organized by Equal Voice Canada in the House of Commons, many of its delegates turned their backs when Trudeau spoke as a protest for his actions of ousting former Cabinet Ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus (see SNC-Lavalin Affair).[280]\nOn October 22, 2015, Trudeau stated that, once prime minister, he would end Canada's airstrike mission against ISIL.[281][282] In his mandate letter to Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, he also called for increased focus on Canadian trainers for local troops and humanitarian aid for the region.[283]\nOn November 13, 2015, Trudeau was asked whether his plans to change Canada's contribution to the fight against ISIL and to repeal parts of Bill C-51 would change following the terrorist attacks in Paris. Trudeau responded, \"It's too soon to jump to conclusions, but obviously governments have a responsibility to keep their citizens safe, while defending our rights and freedoms, and that balance is something the Canadian government, and indeed all governments around the world, will be focusing on.\"[284][285][286]\nOn June 14, 2016, Trudeau refused to recognize ISIS's atrocities as genocide, instead of waiting for an official position from the UN Security Council. He switched his position once the UN Commission released its inquiry on Syria.[287][288]\nTrudeau supported the Harper-negotiated arms deal with Saudi Arabia,[289] believed to be the largest arms sale in Canadian history.[290]\nUpon hearing the news of former President of Cuba Fidel Castro's passing, Trudeau released a statement that described Castro as a \"remarkable leader\" and a \"larger than life leader who served his people\".[291]\nIn 2017, Trudeau criticized Executive Order 13769 entitled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\" signed by President Donald Trump. The executive order bans refugees from seven countries, six of which have Muslim majorities, from entering the United States. On social media, he displayed support for affected refugees.[292]\nIn August 2018, Canada called for the immediate release of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi and his sister Samar. In response to Canada's criticism, Saudi Arabia expelled Canada's ambassador, and froze trade with Canada.[293] Trudeau said that Canada will \"continue to speak clearly and firmly on issues of human rights at home and abroad wherever we see the need\".[294]\nIn September 2018, as the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar became ethnic cleansing against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority,[295] Canada has stripped Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi of her honorary Canadian citizenship.[296] In October 2018, Trudeau condemned the killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul and promised \"consequences\".[297]\nOn September 11, 2019, Trudeau visited the Governor General, Julie Payette, to request the dissolution of Parliament (the act which launches an election).[298] Prior to the formal start of the election, Trudeau announced his intention to only participate in the three leaders' debates, two organized by the Leaders' Debates Commission, and one organized by TVA.[299] The Citytv/Maclean's debate was held on September 12, with an empty podium left on stage for Trudeau.[300][301][302] The Munk Debate on foreign policy was originally scheduled on October 1,[300] although its organizers cancelled the event as a result of Trudeau's decision to not attend.[303][304]\nIn September 2019, controversial pictures and video were published showing Trudeau in brownface and blackface.[305] On September 18, 2019, Time magazine published a photograph of Trudeau wearing brownface makeup in the spring of 2001, at an Arabian Nights-themed gala, while Trudeau was a teacher at West Point Grey Academy.[306] Trudeau publicly apologized, agreeing the photo was racist and saying: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have known better and I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d [307] He further went on to say \"It was something that I didn\u2019t think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do\".[308] Trudeau also admitted to wearing blackface makeup in high school while singing \"Day-O\" at a talent show that was subsequently published by Global News.[309] A third instance, a video, of Trudeau in racist dress was also published.[310]  After this video was published, Trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup.[311]\nIn the days following the scandal, pollsters pointed out that many Canadians either were not bothered by the scandal or had accepted Trudeau's apology.[312][313][314][315] Additionally, minority community groups, racialized commentators and some of Trudeau's opponents came to his defense.[316][317][318][319] Others were more critical, including members of his own party.[320]\nTwo official debates were organized and held by the newly created Leaders' Debates Commission.[321] The English language debate took place on October 7 and the French on October 10.[322][323] Both debates took place at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec.[322][324]\nTrudeau's Liberal Party won the most seats in the 2019 federal election, but the Party lost 20 seats in the House of Commons (lowering its total from 177 to 157) from the time of dissolution.[325] Nevertheless, the Liberals won enough seats to allow Trudeau to form a minority government.[326] For the first time since 1979, the party that garnered a large share of the national popular vote did not win the most seats\u2014Trudeau had 33.1 per cent of the popular vote, while conservative leader Andrew Scheer had 34.4 per cent.[327][328] It was also the first time a government took power with less than 35 per cent of the national popular vote since John A. Macdonald, in 1867, who had 34.8 per cent of the votes.[329] In Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Liberal party won 14 per cent and 10 per cent of the popular vote, respectively[330] while winning all 25 of the Toronto seats, including 24 of 29 seats in the surrounding suburbs of the Greater Toronto Area\u2014in part due to the conservative government in Ontario led by Doug Ford.[327][331]\nTrudeau first met Sophie Gr\u00e9goire when they were both children growing up in Montreal; Gr\u00e9goire was a classmate and childhood friend of Trudeau's youngest brother, Michel.[332] They reconnected as adults in June 2003, when Gr\u00e9goire, by then a Quebec television personality, was assigned as Trudeau's co-host for a charity ball; they began dating several months later. Trudeau and Gr\u00e9goire became engaged in October 2004, and married on May 28, 2005, in a Roman Catholic ceremony at Montreal's Sainte-Madeleine d'Outremont Church.[333] They have three children: Xavier James (born October 18, 2007),[334] Ella-Grace Margaret (born February 5, 2009)[335][336] and Hadrien Gr\u00e9goire (born February 28, 2014).[337][338]\nIn June 2013, two months after Trudeau became the leader of the Liberal Party, the couple sold their home in the C\u00f4te-des-Neiges neighbourhood of Montreal.[339] They began living in a rented home in Ottawa's Rockcliffe Park, the neighbourhood near where Trudeau resided as a child during his father's time as prime minister.[339]\nOn August 18, 2014, an intruder broke into the house while Gr\u00e9goire and the couple's three children were sleeping and left a threatening note; however, nothing was stolen and there was no damage to the property. Following the incident, Trudeau, who was in Winnipeg at the time of the break-in, stated his intention to inquire with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about his home security.[340] After his 2015 electoral victory, Trudeau opted to live at Rideau Cottage, on the grounds of Rideau Hall, until necessary repairs are completed at 24 Sussex to make it habitable.[341]\nTrudeau's physical appearance has been the subject of many international publications.[342][343] Trudeau has a large Earth inside a Haida raven tattoo on his left arm.[344] The tattoo is based on a design by Robert Davidson, a Haida artist whose grandmother ceremonially adopted Pierre Trudeau as an honorary member of the Haida tribe during a 1976 trip to what was then called the Queen Charlotte Islands.[345]\nTrudeau's father was a devout Roman Catholic[346] and his mother converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism just prior to their wedding.[347] As a child, Justin attended Mass each Sunday and said his prayers each night before bedtime. He became a lapsed Catholic at age 18, as he felt that much of his day-to-day life was not addressed by the formality and structure of the church.[66][348] Trudeau described his faith during this period as \"like so many Catholics across this country, I said, 'OK, I'm Catholic, I'm of faith, but I'm just not really going to go to church. Maybe on Easter, maybe midnight Mass at Christmas.'\"[66][348] After the death of his brother Michel in 1998, Trudeau was persuaded by a friend to participate in an Alpha course, during which he regained his faith.[66][348] In 2011, Trudeau stated, \"My own personal faith is an extremely important part of who I am and the values that I try to lead with.\"[349]\n\n\n*Each federal electoral district had 100 points, which were determined by the voters in the district. \n\nBold indicates parties with members elected to the House of Commons.\nBold indicates parties with members elected to the House of Commons.\nJustin Trudeau\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nNancy Patricia Pelosi (/p\u0259\u02c8lo\u028asi/; n\u00e9e\u00a0D'Alesandro; born March 26, 1940) is an American Democratic Party politician serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives since January 2019. She is the first woman in U.S. history to hold this position. As such, and having first been elected to Congress in 1987, Pelosi is the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history.[2] As Speaker of the House, she is second in the presidential line of succession, immediately after the vice president.[3] As of 2019, Pelosi is in her 17th term as a congresswoman. She represents California's 12th congressional district, which consists of four fifths of the city and county of San Francisco. She initially represented the 5th district (1987\u20131993), and then, when district boundaries were redrawn after the 1990 Census, the 8th district (1993\u20132013). She has led House Democrats since 2003\u2014being the first woman to lead a party in Congress\u2014serving twice each as House minority leader (2003\u20132007 and 2011\u20132019, when Republicans held the majority), and as Speaker (2007\u20132011 and 2019\u2013present, during periods of Democratic majority). Pelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush Administration's 2005 attempt to partially privatize Social Security. During her first speakership, she was instrumental in the passage of many landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act. Pelosi lost the speakership in January 2011, after the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. However, she retained her role as leader of the House Democratic Caucus and returned to the role of House minority leader. In the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats won back control of the House.[4] Afterward, when the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Pelosi was again elected speaker,[5] becoming the first former speaker to return to the post since Sam Rayburn in 1955.[6] On September 24, 2019, Pelosi announced the commencement of impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump.[7][8] On January 10, 2020, she announced that she would end the impasse and alerted the House that she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate the following week.[9] Pelosi was born in Baltimore to an Italian-American family. She was the only girl and the youngest of seven children of Annunciata M. \"Nancy\" D'Alesandro (n\u00e9e Lombardi)[10] and Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.,[11] who both had Italian roots.[11] Her mother was born in Campobasso,[10] in South Italy, and her father could trace his Italian ancestry to Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo.[11] When Nancy was born, her father was a Democratic Congressman from Maryland and he became Mayor of Baltimore seven years later.[11][12][13] Pelosi's mother was also active in politics, organizing Democratic women and teaching her daughter the value of social networking.[2] Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was Mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971.[14] Pelosi was involved with politics from an early age. She helped her father at his campaign events. She attended John F. Kennedy's inaugural address when he was sworn in as U.S. president in January 1961.[11] She graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C. with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.[15] Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House majority leader Steny Hoyer.[16] After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th District congressman Phillip Burton, and began working her way up in Democratic politics. In 1976, she was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996. She was elected as party chair for Northern California in January 1977, and four years later was selected to head the California Democratic Party, which she led until 1983.[17] Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco Democratic National Convention Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee finance chair from 1985 to 1986.[18] Phillip Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala. In late 1986, Sala became ill with cancer and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts.[19] Sala died on February 1, 1987, just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, narrowly defeating San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, then easily defeating Republican candidate Harriet Ross on June 2, 1987; Pelosi took office a week later.[20][21] Pelosi represents one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949 and Republicans, who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. She won reelection in the regular election in 1988 and has been reelected another 16 times with no substantive opposition, winning with an average of 80 percent of the vote. She has not participated in candidates' debates since her 1987 race against Harriet Ross.[22] The strongest challenge Pelosi has faced was in 2016 when Preston Picus polled 19.1% and Pelosi won with 80.9%.[23] For the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, she held the distinction of contributing the most among members of Congress to other congressional campaigns, in part because she is in a safe district and does not need the campaign funds.[24] In the House, she served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees, and was the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee until her election as minority leader.[25] Pelosi is a member of the House Baltic Caucus.[26] In 2001, Pelosi was elected the House minority whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.[27] In 2002, after Gephardt resigned as minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in the House.[28] In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats took control of the House, picking up 30 seats.[29] The change in control meant as House minority leader, Pelosi was widely expected to become speaker of the House in the next Congress.[30][31] On November 16, 2006, the Democratic caucus unanimously chose Pelosi as the Democratic candidate for speaker.[32] Pelosi supported her longtime friend, John Murtha of Pennsylvania, for the position of House majority leader, the second-ranking post in the House Democratic caucus. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.[33] Pelosi and Hoyer had a somewhat frosty relationship dating back to 2001, when they ran against each other for minority whip. However, Hoyer was elected as House majority leader over Murtha by a margin of 149\u201386 within the caucus.[34] On January 3, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio with 233 votes compared to his 202 votes in the election for speaker of the House.[35] Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Pelosi and her longtime friend John Dingell of Michigan swore her in, as the dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.[36][37] With her election, Pelosi became the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the speakership. She is also the second speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi. During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the position of speaker: This is a historic moment\u2014for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.[39] She also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress, while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs: The election of 2006 was a call to change\u2014not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.[39] As speaker, Pelosi was still the leader of the House Democrats; the speaker is considered to be the leader of his or her House caucus. However, by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had every right to do so as a full House member. She was also not a member of any House committees. Pelosi was re-elected speaker in 2009. A CBS News poll conducted in March 2010 found that 37% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Speaker Pelosi, with 11% approving.[40] According to a March 2010 Rasmussen national poll, 64% of voters viewed the speaker unfavorably, and 29% favorably.[41] During and after her tenure as speaker, Pelosi was perceived as a contentious political figure, with Republican candidates frequently trying to tie their Democratic opponents to Pelosi and with moderate Democrats seeking to show their moderate bona fides by expressing opposition to Pelosi.[42][43][44][45][46] Shortly after winning re-election, President George W. Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.[47] Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to Bush's proposal, and subsequent defeat of the proposed plan.[48][49] In the wake of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by authorizing wiretaps without a warrant. In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming congressional elections\u2014which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994\u2014Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was \"off the table\". (A week earlier, she had told the Washington Post that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, \"you never know where\" investigations might lead.)[50] After becoming speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.[51] Prior to the U.S. 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress's term.[52][53] The origin for the name \"first hundred hours\" is a play on words derived from former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action on the part of government (to combat the Great Depression) during his \"first hundred days\" in office. Newt Gingrich, who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement the Contract with America. On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from President Bush's confidantes that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi joined with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to condemn the plan. They sent Bush a letter: [T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain.\u00a0... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror.[54] Pelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[55] Pelosi has been credited for spearheading President Obama's health-care law when it seemed it would go down in defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democrat Ted Kennedy's former senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election, thereby causing the Senate Democrats to lose their filibuster proof majority, Obama agreed with then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea that he should do smaller initiatives which could pass easily. Pelosi, however, dismissed the president's fear and instead mocked his scaled-back ideas as \"kiddie care\".[56] After convincing the president this would be their only shot at health-care because of the large Democratic majorities they currently had, she rallied her Democratic caucus as she began an \"unbelievable marathon\" of a two-month session to craft the health-care bill, which successfully passed the House with a 219\u2013212 vote. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he specifically credited Pelosi as being \"one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had\".[57][58][59] Though Pelosi was re-elected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 midterm elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and ceded control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After the electoral setback suffered by her party, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus in the position of minority leader, the office she held prior to becoming speaker. After Pelosi's disparate intra-party opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,[60] Pelosi was elected minority leader for the 112th Congress. On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced she would remain on as Democratic leader.[61] In November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited Pelosi's purchases of Visa stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report \"a right-wing smear\".[62][63][64] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, Pelosi voted for the bill and lauded its passing. Of representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they \"shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all\".[65][66] In August 2016, Pelosi said her personal contact information was posted online following a cyber attack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received \"obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages\". She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.[67] Tim Ryan initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House minority leader on November 17, 2016, prompted by colleagues following the 2016 presidential election.[68] After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members,[69] she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134\u201363 on November 30.[70] In 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi's leadership was again called into question. On June 22, 2017, a small group of House Democrats held a closed-door meeting in the office of Representative Kathleen Rice (NY) to discuss a strategy for selecting new Democratic leadership.[71] Rice publicly called for new Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives, as did other House Democrats, including Tim Ryan (OH), Seth Moulton (MA), and Filemon Vela (TX).[72] Cedric Richmond (LA), Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, also attended the closed-door meeting on Pelosi. Rice said in a CNN interview about Pelosi's leadership, \"If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out and there would be a new strategy put in place.\"[72] In a press conference, Pelosi responded to the criticism by saying, \"I respect any opinion that my members have but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.\"[72] When asked specifically why she should stay on as House minority leader after numerous Democratic seats were lost, Pelosi responded, \"Well, I'm a master legislator. I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country, and that is why I'm able to attract the support that I do.\"[73][74] In November 2017, after Pelosi called for the resignation of John Conyers over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. Pelosi said Congress had \"a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace\".[75] In February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Ryan accusing Republicans with having waged a \"cover-up campaign\" to protect Trump and cited last minute changes to the memo after a vote for its release as dangerous and violating House rules, saying, \"House Republicans' pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities.\"[76] She charged House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes with partaking in \"deliberately dishonest actions\" and called for his immediate removal from his position.[77] In February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest speech in the House of Representatives when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from DREAMers\u2014individuals who were brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants\u2014to object to a budget deal which would raise spending caps without addressing the future of DACA recipients, which were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.[78][79][80] In May 2018, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a briefing by Department of Justice officials on an FBI informant who had made contact with the Trump campaign,[81] Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Wray calling for \"a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers\".[82] In August 2018, Pelosi called for the resignation of Duncan D. Hunter after his indictment on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds, saying in a statement that the charges were \"evidence of the rampant culture of corruption among Republicans in Washington today\".[83] In the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats regained a majority of seats in the House. On November 28, House Democrats nominated Pelosi to once again serve as speaker of the House.[84] She was formally re-elected to the speakership at the start of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Pelosi \"clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow Democrats seeking a new generation of leadership. The deal to win over holdouts put an expiration date on her tenure: she promised not to stay more than four years in the job\". Two hundred twenty House Democrats voted to elect Pelosi speaker, while 15 other House Democrats cast their ballots for someone else or voted present.[85] At the start of the 116th Congress, Pelosi opposed President Trump's attempts to use the 2018\u201319 federal government shutdown (which she called a \"hostage-taking\" of civil servants) as leverage to build a substantial wall on the American border.[86] Pelosi declined to allow Trump to give the State of the Union Address in the House of Representatives chamber while the shutdown was ongoing.[87][88] After several news polls showed Trump's popularity sharply falling due to the shutdown, he signed a January 25 resolution reopening the federal government without any concessions regarding a border wall or other issues.[89] Analysts and commentators widely called the event \"the most humiliating loss of his presidency\".[90][91] Having successfully impeached President Trump on December 18, 2019, and on the eve of his trial before the U.S. Senate, the Washington Post political writer, Paul Kane, called her the most powerful House speaker in, at least, twenty-five years and noting that some historians were comparing her influence to that of former Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas.[92] Pelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but left in 2003 after being elected House minority leader.[93] The American Civil Liberties Union's Congressional Scorecard has given Pelosi a lifetime rating of 92% for her voting record on civil liberties.[94] In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005.[95] She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.[96] Pelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[97] In June 2018, Pelosi visited a federal facility used to detain migrant children separated from their parents and subsequently called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.[98] In July, Pelosi characterized the compromise immigration bill by the Republicans as a deal with the devil and noted she had not had conversations with House Speaker Ryan about a legislative solution to the separation of families at the southern border.[99] Pelosi has long supported LGBT rights. In 1996, she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act,[100] and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states' individual rights to legalize same-sex marriage.[101][102][103] When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state's ban on marriage between same-sex couples in 2008, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the \"historic decision\". She also indirectly voiced her opposition to California Proposition 8, a successful 2008 state ballot initiative which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.[104] The LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign gave Pelosi a 100% rating in 2006 for her voting record in the 107th through 109th congresses (2001\u20132006), indicating that she voted favorably on legislation supported by the organization on every occasion.[105] In 2012, Pelosi said her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage grows from and reflects her Catholic faith; it also places her at odds with Catholic doctrine, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. She said \"My religion compels me\u2014and I love it for it\u2014to be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think it's unconstitutional on top of that.\"[106] Pelosi supports the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, she spoke in Congress in favor of the bill and called for ending discrimination against LGBT people. Pelosi also opposes Trump's transgender military ban.[107] Pelosi supports reform in marijuana laws, although NORML's deputy director Paul Armentano said she and other members of Congress hadn't done anything to change the laws.[108] She also supports use of medical marijuana.[109] Pelosi supports the Bush/Obama NSA surveillance program PRISM.[110] As speaker of the House, Pelosi quietly moved the statue of Robert E. Lee from the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol to the Capitol crypt.[111] In Lee's place, she had a statue of Rosa Parks erected.[111] In August 2017, Pelosi said she supported the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials from the Capitol Building.[112] In 2002, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", including waterboarding, authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah.[113][114][115] After the briefing, Pelosi said she \"was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal\".[116] Two unnamed former Bush Administration officials say the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she didn't raise substantial objections.[117] One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, \"In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.'\"[118] These techniques later became controversial, and in 2007 Pelosi's office said she had protested their use at the time, and she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003.[119] Subsequently, several top Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging that CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a \"number of years\" spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy.[120] Neither letter, lawmakers or the CIA provided details and the circumstances surrounding the allegations make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.[121] Officials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from taking notes or consulting legal experts or members of her own staffs.[122] In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi said, \"In that or any other briefing\u00a0... we were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel\u2014the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further [...] the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.\"[113][123] Pelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by the House by a 300\u2013132 vote, but in the Senate fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required (with 65 out of 100 Senators voting in favor).[124] As speaker of the House, she also spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The Act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but as part of HR 2206 it was included. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by the exclusion of the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer.[125] Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, prior to Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.[126] Pelosi opposed the welfare reform proposed by President Bush as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.[127] She also opposed the tax reform signed by President Trump in December 2017, describing it as \"probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America\u00a0... It robs from the future [and] it rewards the rich\u00a0... and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in our country.\"[128] She said \"this is Armageddon\" and argued that the tax bill increased the debt in a way that would adversely impact social insurance spending.[129] In January 2018, shortly after the tax bill was passed, Pelosi was asked by a reporter to respond to statements by companies attributing the tax cuts for allowing them to raise wages and give bonuses. She said that given the benefits corporations received from the tax bill, the benefits that workers got equated to \"crumbs\".[130][131] Most companies that awarded bonuses gave out payments of hundreds of dollars, while some gave bonuses of significantly over a thousand.[132] In November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with President Trump on infrastructure development. Though he \"really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office\" while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would \"create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions\".[133] On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer met with President Trump about infrastructure funding.[134] In late May a meeting to discuss an impending $2 trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when President Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.[135] In August 2018, after President Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in Northern California, Pelosi lauded the move as \"an important first step\" but requested the president adhere to a wish by California Governor Jerry Brown for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called for the Trump administration to take \"real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive\".[136] In 1999, Pelosi voted against displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including schools.[137] Pelosi voted for the No Child Left Behind Act,[138] which instituted testing to track students' progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.[139][140] In 2019, Pelosi said climate change was \"the existential threat of our time\", and called for action to curb climate change.[141] Pelosi has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence upon foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels.[142] Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[143][144] Pelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.[145] Speaker Pelosi was instrumental in the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Pelosi was a key figure in convincing President Barack Obama to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in a January special election, a defeat that was seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.[58] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's signature health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.[146] Pelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits.[147] She does not endorse Senator Bernie Sanders' bill for single payer healthcare.[148][149] On March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act but would also be willing to form a compromise measure in the event that Republicans were unable to pass a compromise bill and reached out for bipartisan support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important.[150] In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator John McCain for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called for lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to put pressure on Republicans in the health-care discussion. Pelosi said the Democrats would be unified as putting \"a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill\".[151] In July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said the goal of the Democrats \"has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits\u00a0... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans.\"[152] In November 2018, after the Democrats gained a majority in the House following the 2018 midterm elections, Pelosi said, \"I'm staying as speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families and if Hillary had won, I could go home.\" She further stated that Republicans had misrepresented their prior position of being opposed to pre-existing conditions during the election cycle and called for Republicans to join Democrats in \"removing all doubt that the pre-existing medical condition is the law\u2014the benefit\u2014is the law of the land\".[153] Pelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).[154] She has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas (HA 209, rejected), in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision that forbids service women and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected), in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.[154] In 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C. for being \"incorrect\" in comments she made to Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press concerning Church teaching on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop's statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to come with a definition of when life begins. During the interview she said, \"over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy.\"[155] In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI regarding the controversy. In a January 25, 2009 interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said, \"Well, the family planning services reduce cost. They reduce cost. The states are in terrible fiscal budget crises now and part of what we do for children's health, education and some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs. One of those\u2014one of the initiatives you mentioned, the contraception, will reduce costs to the states and to the federal government.\"[156] Pelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the \"Boldest possible move\" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate Gabrielle Giffords.[157] In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by Gun Owners of America and a 7% rating from the National Rifle Association for her stances on gun control.[158] In February 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Pelosi said Republicans cowering to the gun lobby was \"an assault on our whole country\" and that the victims were \"paying the price for our inaction\". She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and noted Republicans had previously created committees to investigate Planned Parenthood and the 2012 Benghazi attack.[159] In November 2018, after the Thousand Oaks shooting, Pelosi released a statement saying Americans \"deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets\" and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.[160] With regard to Representative Charles Rangel's (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support such legislation.[161] In March 2009, the New York Post wrote that the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch had obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff requesting that the United States Air Force (USAF) provide specific aircraft\u2014a Boeing 757\u2014for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.[162][163][164] Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested\u2014for security reasons\u2014that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said \"no one has rendered judgment\" that Pelosi's use of aircraft \"is excessive\".[165] During a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about tweets by Trump responding to the testimony of former FBI James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness.[166] In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[167] In January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address as a performance that was without serious policy ideas both parties could collaborate on. She questioned Trump's refusal to implement Russian sanctions after more than 500 members of Congress voted to approve them.[168] In February, after Trump blocked the release of a Democratic memo by the Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said the act was \"a stunningly brazen attempt to cover up the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal from the American people\" and \"part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president\" who had shown he had something to hide.[169] In March, Pelosi said she was \"more concerned about the president's policies which undermine the financial security of America's working families\" than the Stormy Daniels\u2013Donald Trump scandal. Pelosi did note the scandal as having highlighted a double standard of Republicans on issues of family values and expectations of presidential behavior, saying the party would be very involved if the event was happening to a Democrat.[170] In April, following Scooter Libby being pardoned by Trump, Pelosi released a statement saying the pardon \"sends a troubling signal to the president's allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded and that the idea of those who lie under oath being granted a pardon \"poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy\".[171] On August 15, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, Pelosi said the move was \"a stunning abuse of power [and] a pathetic attempt to silence critics\", and an attempt by Trump to distract attention from other issues of his administration.[172] Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer met with Trump and Pence in December 2018 to discuss changes to be made when the new Democratic representatives takes office in 2019.[173] In January 2019 she supported President Trump in his decision to back the Leader of the Opposition Juan Guaid\u00f3 during Venezuelan protests and constitutional crisis.[174] The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the November 2018 elections, and Pelosi took office as speaker. Multiple House committees launched investigations into various actions by Trump and some of his cabinet members, and requested or subpoenaed documents and information from the White House and the administration.[175] In April 2019, Trump vowed to defy all subpoenas from the House and to refuse to allow current or former administration officials to testify before House committees.[176] On May 7, 2019, the White House intervened to halt former White House Counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the Committee to redirect its records requests to the White House. Pelosi, who had previously urged \"Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment\",[177][178] described Trump's interference regarding McGahn's records as an obstruction of justice, stating that \"Trump is goading us to impeach him.\"[179][180] On May 22, 2019, as the Trump administration continued to ignore subpoenas, refuse to release documents, and encourage or order current and former officials not to testify in Congress, Pelosi declared, \"we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\"[181] Later that day, after learning of Pelosi's comments, Trump walked away from a scheduled White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, in which a $2 trillion infrastructure plan was supposed to be discussed. Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him.[182] Later in the day, Pelosi accused Trump of \"obstructing justice\" and again said he \"is engaged in a cover-up\".[182] On June 5, 2019, during a meeting with senior Democrats about whether the House should launch impeachment proceeding against Trump, Pelosi said, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\" According to multiple sources, rather than impeachment, she wants to see Trump lose to a Democrat in the 2020 election, following which he could be prosecuted.[183] In March 2008, after a meeting with the Dalai Lama, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet and called on \"freedom-loving people\" worldwide to denounce China. She said, \"The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world\", while addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India.[184] In October 2008, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its \"bold decision\" to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia. Pelosi's statement read, \"I call on the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.\"[185] Pelosi criticized the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists in August 2017 for their roles in a protest at the Civic Square in front of the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong. She called the ruling an injustice that should \"shock the conscience of the world\".[186] Before the Trump Administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China and impose real punishments, such as fulfill his own campaign commitments to label China a currency manipulator and stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Pelosi urged Trump to take a strong stand against unfair market barriers in China.[187][188][189][190] In September 2019, Pelosi met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Chinese media criticized Pelosi sharply for this meeting, accusing her of \"backing and encouraging radical activists\".[191] Pelosi publicly scolded Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe during Uribe's May 2007 state visit to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had \"expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations\" of links between paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials.[192] Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free-trade agreement.[193] In 2008, Pelosi said: \"For years, I have opposed the embargo on Cuba. I don't think it's been successful, and I think we have to remove the travel bans and have more exchanges\u2014people to people exchanges with Cuba.\"[194] In 2015, Pelosi supported President Obama's Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Castro's regime in Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.[195] Pelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.[127][196] In a February 15, 2007, interview Pelosi noted that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran \"and I take him at his word\". At the same time, she said, \"I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran\".[197] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution[198] requiring that\u2014absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces\u2014the president must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[199] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007. In July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the Iran nuclear deal, crediting the president with having made a \"very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran\" and called the deal \"a diplomatic masterpiece\".[200] In 2016, Pelosi argued against the passage of two bills that if enacted would block Iran's access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: \"Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal.\"[201] In May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and \"particularly senseless, disturbing & dangerous\".[202] In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President Bush to use military force against Iraq,[203] while stating that Iraq, like \"other countries of concern\", had WMDs.[204] In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi noted that Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet had told Congress the likelihood of Saddam Hussein's launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low. \"This is about the Constitution,\" Pelosi said. \"It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops.\" While Pelosi opposed, Congress still passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States against Iraq.[205] Although Pelosi voted against the Iraq War, anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader.[206] Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.[207] Pelosi reaffirms that \"America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship\".[208] Pelosi emphasized that \"a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering,\u00a0... [h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe.\" Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which urged the federal government to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.[209] Prior to 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative disapproving of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations defined as terrorist by the legislation. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli \"hopeful signs\" of offering land, while criticizing Palestinian \"threats\" of not demonstrating peace in turn. She states, \"If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace\".[208] During the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921 on the count that \"the seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond\". She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah \"have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent\". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border \"have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah\" in part for their use of \"civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas\".[210] In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Knesset speaker Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the \"strong friendship\" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up the replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a \"symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel\".[211] Pelosi supported Israel in the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[212] In March 2018 Pelosi said, \"There is no greater political accomplishment in the 20th Century than the establishment of the State of Israel.\"[213] In March 2019, she said, \"Israel and America are connected now and forever. We will never allow anyone to make Israel a wedge issue.\"[214] In January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution condemning the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a \"flagrant violation\" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.[215][216] Nancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to North Korea. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the North Korean regime, and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country's leadership.[217][218] In August 2017, following Trump's warning that North Korea \"will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were \"recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility.\"[219] In November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all North Korea's nuclear weapons without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang's selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to \"exhaust every other remedy\".[220] In June 2018, after Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Pelosi said in a statement, \"In his haste to reach an agreement, President Trump elevated North Korea to the level of the United States while preserving the regime's status quo.\"[221] In December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved \"a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia's attack\" and \"America's democracy and national security\" being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to \"fully investigate Russia's assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks\".[222] In February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with President of Russia Vladimir Putin at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods.[223] In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior.[224] She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: \"Putin's ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation's capital.\" She called for House Speaker Ryan to \"make clear that there is not\u2014and never will be\u2014an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress.\"[225] Pelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that \"for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough\" to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. \"If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.\"[226] Pelosi supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011.[227] She also favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[228] In January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump's planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She called Trump's announcement a \"Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin\".[229] In an October 2019 letter to Democratic caucus members, Pelosi wrote that both parties were condemning President Trump's deserting the US's \"Kurdish allies in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman\" Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey and opined that the decision \"poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner.\"[230] In mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote.[231] The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's Prime Minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.\u2013Turkey relations.[232] After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.[233] The resolution was passed during Pelosi's second term as a speaker. The house voted 405 to 11 in October 2019 to confirm the resolution.[234] Pelosi's only close race so far has been in the special election to succeed U.S. Representative Sala Burton after her death in February 1987. Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt in the Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent,[19][235] then Republican Harriet Ross by more than 2-to-1.[236] Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in California's 5th congressional district 1988 and 1990. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 Census, Pelosi ran in California's 8th congressional district, which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only twice. She met Paul Frank Pelosi while she was attending college.[237] They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963.[238] After the couple married, they moved to New York, and then to San Francisco in 1969, where Paul Pelosi's brother, Ronald Pelosi, was a member of the City and County of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.[239] Nancy and Paul Pelosi have five children: Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, as well as nine grandchildren.[240] Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, Journeys with George. In 2007, Christine published a book, Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders.[241] Pelosi resides in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.[242][243] Her 2016 financial disclosure report lists among her assets a combined home and vineyard in St. Helena, California, two commercial buildings in San Francisco, and a townhome in Loomis, California.[244] The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) estimated in 2009 that Pelosi's average net worth was US$58,436,537, ranking her 13th among 25 wealthiest members of Congress.[245] In 2014, CRP reported Pelosi's average net worth in 2014 was US$101,273,023 having ranked 8th out of 25 wealthiest members of Congress.[246] Business Insider reported that Pelosi's worth was $26.4 million in 2012 and made her the 13th richest member of Congress.[247] In 2014, Roll Call estimated that Pelosi's net worth was $29.35 million, ranking her the 15th wealthiest member of Congress.[248] Roll Call said Pelosi's earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks that include Apple, Disney, Comcast, and Facebook. Roll Call reported that the Pelosis have $13.46 million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties. According to Roll Call, Pelosi and her husband hold properties \"worth at least $14.65 million, including a St. Helena vineyard in Napa Valley worth at least $5 million, and commercial real estate in San Francisco.\"[248] Pelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.[249] She served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and remains involved in the foundation.",

As such, and having first been elected to Congress in 1987, Pelosi is the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history.[2] As Speaker of the House, she is second in the presidential line of succession, immediately after the vice president.[3]\nAs of 2019, Pelosi is in her 17th term as a congresswoman. She represents California's 12th congressional district, which consists of four fifths of the city and county of San Francisco. She initially represented the 5th district (1987\u20131993), and then, when district boundaries were redrawn after the 1990 Census, the 8th district (1993\u20132013).\nShe has led House Democrats since 2003\u2014being the first woman to lead a party in Congress\u2014serving twice each as House minority leader (2003\u20132007 and 2011\u20132019, when Republicans held the majority), and as Speaker (2007\u20132011 and 2019\u2013present, during periods of Democratic majority).\nPelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush Administration's 2005 attempt to partially privatize Social Security. During her first speakership, she was instrumental in the passage of many landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act.\nPelosi lost the speakership in January 2011, after the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. However, she retained her role as leader of the House Democratic Caucus and returned to the role of House minority leader. In the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats won back control of the House.[4] Afterward, when the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Pelosi was again elected speaker,[5] becoming the first former speaker to return to the post since Sam Rayburn in 1955.[6] On September 24, 2019, Pelosi announced the commencement of impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump.[7][8] On January 10, 2020, she announced that she would end the impasse and alerted the House that she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate the following week.[9]\nPelosi was born in Baltimore to an Italian-American family. She was the only girl and the youngest of seven children of Annunciata M. \"Nancy\" D'Alesandro (n\u00e9e Lombardi)[10] and Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.,[11] who both had Italian roots.[11] Her mother was born in Campobasso,[10] in South Italy, and her father could trace his Italian ancestry to Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo.[11] When Nancy was born, her father was a Democratic Congressman from Maryland and he became Mayor of Baltimore seven years later.[11][12][13] Pelosi's mother was also active in politics, organizing Democratic women and teaching her daughter the value of social networking.[2] Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was Mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971.[14]\nPelosi was involved with politics from an early age. She helped her father at his campaign events. She attended John F. Kennedy's inaugural address when he was sworn in as U.S. president in January 1961.[11] She graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C. with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.[15] Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House majority leader Steny Hoyer.[16]\nAfter moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th District congressman Phillip Burton, and began working her way up in Democratic politics. In 1976, she was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996. She was elected as party chair for Northern California in January 1977, and four years later was selected to head the California Democratic Party, which she led until 1983.[17] Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco Democratic National Convention Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee finance chair from 1985 to 1986.[18]\nPhillip Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala. In late 1986, Sala became ill with cancer and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts.[19] Sala died on February 1, 1987, just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, narrowly defeating San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, then easily defeating Republican candidate Harriet Ross on June 2, 1987; Pelosi took office a week later.[20][21]\nPelosi represents one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949 and Republicans, who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. She won reelection in the regular election in 1988 and has been reelected another 16 times with no substantive opposition, winning with an average of 80 percent of the vote. She has not participated in candidates' debates since her 1987 race against Harriet Ross.[22] The strongest challenge Pelosi has faced was in 2016 when Preston Picus polled 19.1% and Pelosi won with 80.9%.[23]\nFor the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, she held the distinction of contributing the most among members of Congress to other congressional campaigns, in part because she is in a safe district and does not need the campaign funds.[24]\nIn the House, she served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees, and was the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee until her election as minority leader.[25]\nPelosi is a member of the House Baltic Caucus.[26]\nIn 2001, Pelosi was elected the House minority whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.[27]\nIn 2002, after Gephardt resigned as minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in the House.[28]\nIn the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats took control of the House, picking up 30 seats.[29] The change in control meant as House minority leader, Pelosi was widely expected to become speaker of the House in the next Congress.[30][31] On November 16, 2006, the Democratic caucus unanimously chose Pelosi as the Democratic candidate for speaker.[32]\nPelosi supported her longtime friend, John Murtha of Pennsylvania, for the position of House majority leader, the second-ranking post in the House Democratic caucus. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.[33] Pelosi and Hoyer had a somewhat frosty relationship dating back to 2001, when they ran against each other for minority whip. However, Hoyer was elected as House majority leader over Murtha by a margin of 149\u201386 within the caucus.[34]\nOn January 3, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio with 233 votes compared to his 202 votes in the election for speaker of the House.[35] Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Pelosi and her longtime friend John Dingell of Michigan swore her in, as the dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.[36][37]\nWith her election, Pelosi became the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the speakership. She is also the second speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.\nDuring her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the position of speaker:\nThis is a historic moment\u2014for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.[39]\nShe also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress, while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:\nThe election of 2006 was a call to change\u2014not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.[39]\nAs speaker, Pelosi was still the leader of the House Democrats; the speaker is considered to be the leader of his or her House caucus. However, by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had every right to do so as a full House member. She was also not a member of any House committees.\nPelosi was re-elected speaker in 2009.\nA CBS News poll conducted in March 2010 found that 37% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Speaker Pelosi, with 11% approving.[40] According to a March 2010 Rasmussen national poll, 64% of voters viewed the speaker unfavorably, and 29% favorably.[41]\nDuring and after her tenure as speaker, Pelosi was perceived as a contentious political figure, with Republican candidates frequently trying to tie their Democratic opponents to Pelosi and with moderate Democrats seeking to show their moderate bona fides by expressing opposition to Pelosi.[42][43][44][45][46]\nShortly after winning re-election, President George W. Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.[47] Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to Bush's proposal, and subsequent defeat of the proposed plan.[48][49]\nIn the wake of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by authorizing wiretaps without a warrant.\nIn May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming congressional elections\u2014which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994\u2014Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was \"off the table\". (A week earlier, she had told the Washington Post that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, \"you never know where\" investigations might lead.)[50]\nAfter becoming speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.[51]\nPrior to the U.S. 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress's term.[52][53]\nThe origin for the name \"first hundred hours\" is a play on words derived from former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action on the part of government (to combat the Great Depression) during his \"first hundred days\" in office. Newt Gingrich, who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement the Contract with America.\nOn January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from President Bush's confidantes that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi joined with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to condemn the plan. They sent Bush a letter:\n[T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain.\u00a0... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror.[54]\nPelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[55]\nPelosi has been credited for spearheading President Obama's health-care law when it seemed it would go down in defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democrat Ted Kennedy's former senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election, thereby causing the Senate Democrats to lose their filibuster proof majority, Obama agreed with then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea that he should do smaller initiatives which could pass easily. Pelosi, however, dismissed the president's fear and instead mocked his scaled-back ideas as \"kiddie care\".[56] After convincing the president this would be their only shot at health-care because of the large Democratic majorities they currently had, she rallied her Democratic caucus as she began an \"unbelievable marathon\" of a two-month session to craft the health-care bill, which successfully passed the House with a 219\u2013212 vote. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he specifically credited Pelosi as being \"one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had\".[57][58][59]\nThough Pelosi was re-elected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 midterm elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and ceded control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After the electoral setback suffered by her party, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus in the position of minority leader, the office she held prior to becoming speaker. After Pelosi's disparate intra-party opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,[60] Pelosi was elected minority leader for the 112th Congress. On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced she would remain on as Democratic leader.[61]\nIn November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited Pelosi's purchases of Visa stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report \"a right-wing smear\".[62][63][64] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, Pelosi voted for the bill and lauded its passing. Of representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they \"shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all\".[65][66]\nIn August 2016, Pelosi said her personal contact information was posted online following a cyber attack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received \"obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages\". She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.[67]\nTim Ryan initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House minority leader on November 17, 2016, prompted by colleagues following the 2016 presidential election.[68] After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members,[69] she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134\u201363 on November 30.[70]\nIn 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi's leadership was again called into question. On June 22, 2017, a small group of House Democrats held a closed-door meeting in the office of Representative Kathleen Rice (NY) to discuss a strategy for selecting new Democratic leadership.[71] Rice publicly called for new Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives, as did other House Democrats, including Tim Ryan (OH), Seth Moulton (MA), and Filemon Vela (TX).[72] Cedric Richmond (LA), Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, also attended the closed-door meeting on Pelosi.\nRice said in a CNN interview about Pelosi's leadership, \"If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out and there would be a new strategy put in place.\"[72]\nIn a press conference, Pelosi responded to the criticism by saying, \"I respect any opinion that my members have but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.\"[72] When asked specifically why she should stay on as House minority leader after numerous Democratic seats were lost, Pelosi responded, \"Well, I'm a master legislator. I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country, and that is why I'm able to attract the support that I do.\"[73][74]\nIn November 2017, after Pelosi called for the resignation of John Conyers over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. Pelosi said Congress had \"a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace\".[75]\nIn February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Ryan accusing Republicans with having waged a \"cover-up campaign\" to protect Trump and cited last minute changes to the memo after a vote for its release as dangerous and violating House rules, saying, \"House Republicans' pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities.\"[76] She charged House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes with partaking in \"deliberately dishonest actions\" and called for his immediate removal from his position.[77]\nIn February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest speech in the House of Representatives when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from DREAMers\u2014individuals who were brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants\u2014to object to a budget deal which would raise spending caps without addressing the future of DACA recipients, which were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.[78][79][80]\nIn May 2018, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a briefing by Department of Justice officials on an FBI informant who had made contact with the Trump campaign,[81] Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Wray calling for \"a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers\".[82]\nIn August 2018, Pelosi called for the resignation of Duncan D. Hunter after his indictment on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds, saying in a statement that the charges were \"evidence of the rampant culture of corruption among Republicans in Washington today\".[83]\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, the Democrats regained a majority of seats in the House. On November 28, House Democrats nominated Pelosi to once again serve as speaker of the House.[84] She was formally re-elected to the speakership at the start of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Pelosi \"clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow Democrats seeking a new generation of leadership. The deal to win over holdouts put an expiration date on her tenure: she promised not to stay more than four years in the job\". Two hundred twenty House Democrats voted to elect Pelosi speaker, while 15 other House Democrats cast their ballots for someone else or voted present.[85]\nAt the start of the 116th Congress, Pelosi opposed President Trump's attempts to use the 2018\u201319 federal government shutdown (which she called a \"hostage-taking\" of civil servants) as leverage to build a substantial wall on the American border.[86] Pelosi declined to allow Trump to give the State of the Union Address in the House of Representatives chamber while the shutdown was ongoing.[87][88] After several news polls showed Trump's popularity sharply falling due to the shutdown, he signed a January 25 resolution reopening the federal government without any concessions regarding a border wall or other issues.[89] Analysts and commentators widely called the event \"the most humiliating loss of his presidency\".[90][91]\nHaving successfully impeached President Trump on December 18, 2019, and on the eve of his trial before the U.S. Senate, the Washington Post political writer, Paul Kane, called her the most powerful House speaker in, at least, twenty-five years and noting that some historians were comparing her influence to that of former Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas.[92]\nPelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but left in 2003 after being elected House minority leader.[93]\nThe American Civil Liberties Union's Congressional Scorecard has given Pelosi a lifetime rating of 92% for her voting record on civil liberties.[94] In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005.[95] She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.[96]\nPelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[97]\nIn June 2018, Pelosi visited a federal facility used to detain migrant children separated from their parents and subsequently called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.[98] In July, Pelosi characterized the compromise immigration bill by the Republicans as a deal with the devil and noted she had not had conversations with House Speaker Ryan about a legislative solution to the separation of families at the southern border.[99]\nPelosi has long supported LGBT rights. In 1996, she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act,[100] and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states' individual rights to legalize same-sex marriage.[101][102][103] When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state's ban on marriage between same-sex couples in 2008, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the \"historic decision\". She also indirectly voiced her opposition to California Proposition 8, a successful 2008 state ballot initiative which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.[104]\nThe LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign gave Pelosi a 100% rating in 2006 for her voting record in the 107th through 109th congresses (2001\u20132006), indicating that she voted favorably on legislation supported by the organization on every occasion.[105] In 2012, Pelosi said her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage grows from and reflects her Catholic faith; it also places her at odds with Catholic doctrine, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. She said \"My religion compels me\u2014and I love it for it\u2014to be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think it's unconstitutional on top of that.\"[106]\nPelosi supports the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, she spoke in Congress in favor of the bill and called for ending discrimination against LGBT people. Pelosi also opposes Trump's transgender military ban.[107]\nPelosi supports reform in marijuana laws, although NORML's deputy director Paul Armentano said she and other members of Congress hadn't done anything to change the laws.[108] She also supports use of medical marijuana.[109]\nPelosi supports the Bush/Obama NSA surveillance program PRISM.[110]\nAs speaker of the House, Pelosi quietly moved the statue of Robert E. Lee from the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol to the Capitol crypt.[111] In Lee's place, she had a statue of Rosa Parks erected.[111] In August 2017, Pelosi said she supported the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials from the Capitol Building.[112]\nIn 2002, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", including waterboarding, authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah.[113][114][115] After the briefing, Pelosi said she \"was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal\".[116] Two unnamed former Bush Administration officials say the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she didn't raise substantial objections.[117] One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, \"In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.'\"[118]\nThese techniques later became controversial, and in 2007 Pelosi's office said she had protested their use at the time, and she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003.[119] Subsequently, several top Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging that CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a \"number of years\" spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy.[120] Neither letter, lawmakers or the CIA provided details and the circumstances surrounding the allegations make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.[121]\nOfficials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from taking notes or consulting legal experts or members of her own staffs.[122] In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi said, \"In that or any other briefing\u00a0... we were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel\u2014the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further [...] the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.\"[113][123]\nPelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by the House by a 300\u2013132 vote, but in the Senate fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required (with 65 out of 100 Senators voting in favor).[124]\nAs speaker of the House, she also spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The Act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but as part of HR 2206 it was included. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by the exclusion of the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer.[125] Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, prior to Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.[126]\nPelosi opposed the welfare reform proposed by President Bush as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.[127] She also opposed the tax reform signed by President Trump in December 2017, describing it as \"probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America\u00a0... It robs from the future [and] it rewards the rich\u00a0... and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in our country.\"[128] She said \"this is Armageddon\" and argued that the tax bill increased the debt in a way that would adversely impact social insurance spending.[129] In January 2018, shortly after the tax bill was passed, Pelosi was asked by a reporter to respond to statements by companies attributing the tax cuts for allowing them to raise wages and give bonuses. She said that given the benefits corporations received from the tax bill, the benefits that workers got equated to \"crumbs\".[130][131] Most companies that awarded bonuses gave out payments of hundreds of dollars, while some gave bonuses of significantly over a thousand.[132]\nIn November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with President Trump on infrastructure development. Though he \"really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office\" while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would \"create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions\".[133] On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer met with President Trump about infrastructure funding.[134] In late May a meeting to discuss an impending $2 trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when President Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.[135]\nIn August 2018, after President Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in Northern California, Pelosi lauded the move as \"an important first step\" but requested the president adhere to a wish by California Governor Jerry Brown for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called for the Trump administration to take \"real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive\".[136]\nIn 1999, Pelosi voted against displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including schools.[137] Pelosi voted for the No Child Left Behind Act,[138] which instituted testing to track students' progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.[139][140]\nIn 2019, Pelosi said climate change was \"the existential threat of our time\", and called for action to curb climate change.[141]\nPelosi has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence upon foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels.[142] Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[143][144]\nPelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.[145]\nSpeaker Pelosi was instrumental in the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Pelosi was a key figure in convincing President Barack Obama to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in a January special election, a defeat that was seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.[58] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's signature health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.[146]\nPelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits.[147] She does not endorse Senator Bernie Sanders' bill for single payer healthcare.[148][149]\nOn March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act but would also be willing to form a compromise measure in the event that Republicans were unable to pass a compromise bill and reached out for bipartisan support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important.[150] In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator John McCain for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called for lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to put pressure on Republicans in the health-care discussion. Pelosi said the Democrats would be unified as putting \"a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill\".[151]\nIn July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said the goal of the Democrats \"has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits\u00a0... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans.\"[152] In November 2018, after the Democrats gained a majority in the House following the 2018 midterm elections, Pelosi said, \"I'm staying as speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families and if Hillary had won, I could go home.\" She further stated that Republicans had misrepresented their prior position of being opposed to pre-existing conditions during the election cycle and called for Republicans to join Democrats in \"removing all doubt that the pre-existing medical condition is the law\u2014the benefit\u2014is the law of the land\".[153]\nPelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).[154]\nShe has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas (HA 209, rejected), in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision that forbids service women and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected), in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.[154]\nIn 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C. for being \"incorrect\" in comments she made to Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press concerning Church teaching on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop's statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to come with a definition of when life begins. During the interview she said, \"over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy.\"[155] In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI regarding the controversy.\nIn a January 25, 2009 interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said, \"Well, the family planning services reduce cost. They reduce cost. The states are in terrible fiscal budget crises now and part of what we do for children's health, education and some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs. One of those\u2014one of the initiatives you mentioned, the contraception, will reduce costs to the states and to the federal government.\"[156]\nPelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the \"Boldest possible move\" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate Gabrielle Giffords.[157] In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by Gun Owners of America and a 7% rating from the National Rifle Association for her stances on gun control.[158]\nIn February 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Pelosi said Republicans cowering to the gun lobby was \"an assault on our whole country\" and that the victims were \"paying the price for our inaction\". She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and noted Republicans had previously created committees to investigate Planned Parenthood and the 2012 Benghazi attack.[159]\nIn November 2018, after the Thousand Oaks shooting, Pelosi released a statement saying Americans \"deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets\" and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.[160]\nWith regard to Representative Charles Rangel's (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support such legislation.[161]\nIn March 2009, the New York Post wrote that the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch had obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff requesting that the United States Air Force (USAF) provide specific aircraft\u2014a Boeing 757\u2014for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.[162][163][164] Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested\u2014for security reasons\u2014that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said \"no one has rendered judgment\" that Pelosi's use of aircraft \"is excessive\".[165]\nDuring a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about tweets by Trump responding to the testimony of former FBI James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness.[166] In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[167]\nIn January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address as a performance that was without serious policy ideas both parties could collaborate on. She questioned Trump's refusal to implement Russian sanctions after more than 500 members of Congress voted to approve them.[168] In February, after Trump blocked the release of a Democratic memo by the Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said the act was \"a stunningly brazen attempt to cover up the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal from the American people\" and \"part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president\" who had shown he had something to hide.[169] In March, Pelosi said she was \"more concerned about the president's policies which undermine the financial security of America's working families\" than the Stormy Daniels\u2013Donald Trump scandal. Pelosi did note the scandal as having highlighted a double standard of Republicans on issues of family values and expectations of presidential behavior, saying the party would be very involved if the event was happening to a Democrat.[170] In April, following Scooter Libby being pardoned by Trump, Pelosi released a statement saying the pardon \"sends a troubling signal to the president's allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded and that the idea of those who lie under oath being granted a pardon \"poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy\".[171] On August 15, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, Pelosi said the move was \"a stunning abuse of power [and] a pathetic attempt to silence critics\", and an attempt by Trump to distract attention from other issues of his administration.[172] Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer met with Trump and Pence in December 2018 to discuss changes to be made when the new Democratic representatives takes office in 2019.[173] In January 2019 she supported President Trump in his decision to back the Leader of the Opposition Juan Guaid\u00f3 during Venezuelan protests and constitutional crisis.[174]\nThe Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the November 2018 elections, and Pelosi took office as speaker. Multiple House committees launched investigations into various actions by Trump and some of his cabinet members, and requested or subpoenaed documents and information from the White House and the administration.[175] In April 2019, Trump vowed to defy all subpoenas from the House and to refuse to allow current or former administration officials to testify before House committees.[176] On May 7, 2019, the White House intervened to halt former White House Counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the Committee to redirect its records requests to the White House. Pelosi, who had previously urged \"Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment\",[177][178] described Trump's interference regarding McGahn's records as an obstruction of justice, stating that \"Trump is goading us to impeach him.\"[179][180]\nOn May 22, 2019, as the Trump administration continued to ignore subpoenas, refuse to release documents, and encourage or order current and former officials not to testify in Congress, Pelosi declared, \"we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\"[181] Later that day, after learning of Pelosi's comments, Trump walked away from a scheduled White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, in which a $2 trillion infrastructure plan was supposed to be discussed. Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him.[182] Later in the day, Pelosi accused Trump of \"obstructing justice\" and again said he \"is engaged in a cover-up\".[182]\nOn June 5, 2019, during a meeting with senior Democrats about whether the House should launch impeachment proceeding against Trump, Pelosi said, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\" According to multiple sources, rather than impeachment, she wants to see Trump lose to a Democrat in the 2020 election, following which he could be prosecuted.[183]\nIn March 2008, after a meeting with the Dalai Lama, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet and called on \"freedom-loving people\" worldwide to denounce China. She said, \"The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world\", while addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India.[184]\nIn October 2008, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its \"bold decision\" to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia. Pelosi's statement read, \"I call on the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.\"[185]\nPelosi criticized the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists in August 2017 for their roles in a protest at the Civic Square in front of the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong. She called the ruling an injustice that should \"shock the conscience of the world\".[186]\nBefore the Trump Administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China and impose real punishments, such as fulfill his own campaign commitments to label China a currency manipulator and stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Pelosi urged Trump to take a strong stand against unfair market barriers in China.[187][188][189][190]\nIn September 2019, Pelosi met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Chinese media criticized Pelosi sharply for this meeting, accusing her of \"backing and encouraging radical activists\".[191]\nPelosi publicly scolded Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe during Uribe's May 2007 state visit to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had \"expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations\" of links between paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials.[192] Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free-trade agreement.[193]\nIn 2008, Pelosi said: \"For years, I have opposed the embargo on Cuba. I don't think it's been successful, and I think we have to remove the travel bans and have more exchanges\u2014people to people exchanges with Cuba.\"[194] In 2015, Pelosi supported President Obama's Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Castro's regime in Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.[195]\nPelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.[127][196]\nIn a February 15, 2007, interview Pelosi noted that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran \"and I take him at his word\". At the same time, she said, \"I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran\".[197] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution[198] requiring that\u2014absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces\u2014the president must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[199] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007.\nIn July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the Iran nuclear deal, crediting the president with having made a \"very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran\" and called the deal \"a diplomatic masterpiece\".[200]\nIn 2016, Pelosi argued against the passage of two bills that if enacted would block Iran's access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: \"Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal.\"[201]\nIn May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and \"particularly senseless, disturbing &amp; dangerous\".[202]\nIn 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President Bush to use military force against Iraq,[203] while stating that Iraq, like \"other countries of concern\", had WMDs.[204] In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi noted that Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet had told Congress the likelihood of Saddam Hussein's launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low. \"This is about the Constitution,\" Pelosi said. \"It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops.\" While Pelosi opposed, Congress still passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States against Iraq.[205]\nAlthough Pelosi voted against the Iraq War, anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader.[206] Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.[207]\nPelosi reaffirms that \"America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship\".[208] Pelosi emphasized that \"a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering,\u00a0... [h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe.\" Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which urged the federal government to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.[209] Prior to 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative disapproving of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations defined as terrorist by the legislation. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli \"hopeful signs\" of offering land, while criticizing Palestinian \"threats\" of not demonstrating peace in turn. She states, \"If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace\".[208]\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921 on the count that \"the seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond\". She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah \"have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent\". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border \"have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah\" in part for their use of \"civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas\".[210]\nIn September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Knesset speaker Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the \"strong friendship\" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up the replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a \"symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel\".[211]\nPelosi supported Israel in the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[212] In March 2018 Pelosi said, \"There is no greater political accomplishment in the 20th Century than the establishment of the State of Israel.\"[213] In March 2019, she said, \"Israel and America are connected now and forever. We will never allow anyone to make Israel a wedge issue.\"[214]\nIn January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution condemning the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a \"flagrant violation\" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.[215][216]\nNancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to North Korea. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the North Korean regime, and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country's leadership.[217][218]\nIn August 2017, following Trump's warning that North Korea \"will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were \"recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility.\"[219]\nIn November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all North Korea's nuclear weapons without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang's selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to \"exhaust every other remedy\".[220]\nIn June 2018, after Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Pelosi said in a statement, \"In his haste to reach an agreement, President Trump elevated North Korea to the level of the United States while preserving the regime's status quo.\"[221]\nIn December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved \"a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia's attack\" and \"America's democracy and national security\" being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to \"fully investigate Russia's assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks\".[222]\nIn February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with President of Russia Vladimir Putin at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods.[223] In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior.[224] She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: \"Putin's ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation's capital.\" She called for House Speaker Ryan to \"make clear that there is not\u2014and never will be\u2014an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress.\"[225]\nPelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that \"for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough\" to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. \"If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.\"[226]\nPelosi supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011.[227] She also favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[228]\nIn January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump's planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She called Trump's announcement a \"Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin\".[229] In an October 2019 letter to Democratic caucus members, Pelosi wrote that both parties were condemning President Trump's deserting the US's \"Kurdish allies in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman\" Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey and opined that the decision \"poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner.\"[230]\nIn mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote.[231] The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's Prime Minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.\u2013Turkey relations.[232] After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.[233]\nThe resolution was passed during Pelosi's second term as a speaker. The house voted 405 to 11 in October 2019 to confirm the resolution.[234]\nPelosi's only close race so far has been in the special election to succeed U.S. Representative Sala Burton after her death in February 1987. Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt in the Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent,[19][235] then Republican Harriet Ross by more than 2-to-1.[236] Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in California's 5th congressional district 1988 and 1990. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 Census, Pelosi ran in California's 8th congressional district, which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only twice.\nShe met Paul Frank Pelosi while she was attending college.[237] They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963.[238] After the couple married, they moved to New York, and then to San Francisco in 1969, where Paul Pelosi's brother, Ronald Pelosi, was a member of the City and County of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.[239]\nNancy and Paul Pelosi have five children: Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, as well as nine grandchildren.[240] Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, Journeys with George. In 2007, Christine published a book, Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders.[241]\nPelosi resides in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.[242][243] Her 2016 financial disclosure report lists among her assets a combined home and vineyard in St. Helena, California, two commercial buildings in San Francisco, and a townhome in Loomis, California.[244]\nThe nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) estimated in 2009 that Pelosi's average net worth was US$58,436,537, ranking her 13th among 25 wealthiest members of Congress.[245] In 2014, CRP reported Pelosi's average net worth in 2014 was US$101,273,023 having ranked 8th out of 25 wealthiest members of Congress.[246] Business Insider reported that Pelosi's worth was $26.4 million in 2012 and made her the 13th richest member of Congress.[247] In 2014, Roll Call estimated that Pelosi's net worth was $29.35 million, ranking her the 15th wealthiest member of Congress.[248]\nRoll Call said Pelosi's earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks that include Apple, Disney, Comcast, and Facebook. Roll Call reported that the Pelosis have $13.46 million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties. According to Roll Call, Pelosi and her husband hold properties \"worth at least $14.65 million, including a St. Helena vineyard in Napa Valley worth at least $5 million, and commercial real estate in San Francisco.\"[248]\nPelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.[249] She served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and remains involved in the foundation.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nEdward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American whistleblower who copied and leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 when he was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments, and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy. In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA.[1] Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times. On Snowden's 30th birthday, June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property,[2] following which the Department of State revoked his passport.[3] Two days later, he flew into Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, where Russian authorities noted that his U.S. passport had been cancelled, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, and repeated extensions have permitted him to stay at least until 2020. In early 2016, he became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a San Francisco-based organization that states its purpose is to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance.[4] As of 2017 he is married and living in Moscow.[5][6] On September 17, 2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published.[7] On the first day of publication, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit against Snowden over publication of his memoir, alleging he had breached nondisclosure agreements signed with the U.S. federal government.[8] Former The Guardian national security reporter Ewen MacAskill called the civil lawsuit a \"huge mistake\", noting that the \"UK ban of Spycatcher 30 years ago created huge demand\".[9][10] The memoir was listed as no. 1 on Amazon's bestseller list that same day.[11] In an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! on September 26, 2019, Snowden clarified he considers himself a \"whistleblower\" as opposed to a \"leaker\" as he considers \"a leaker only distributes information for personal gain\".[12] Edward Joseph Snowden was born on June 21, 1983,[13] in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.[14] His maternal grandfather, Edward J. Barrett,[15][16] a rear admiral in the U.S. Coast Guard, became a senior official with the FBI and was at the Pentagon in 2001 during the September 11 attacks.[17] Snowden's father, Lonnie, was also an officer in the Coast Guard,[18] and his mother, Elizabeth, is a clerk at the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.[19][20][21][22][23] His older sister, Jessica, was a lawyer at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C. Edward Snowden said that he had expected to work for the federal government, as had the rest of his family.[24] His parents divorced in 2001,[25] and his father remarried.[26] Snowden scored above 145 on two separate IQ tests.[24] In the early 1990s, while still in grade school, Snowden moved with his family to the area of Fort Meade, Maryland.[27] Mononucleosis caused him to miss high school for almost nine months.[24] Rather than returning to school, he passed the GED test[28] and took classes at Anne Arundel Community College.[21] Although Snowden had no undergraduate college degree,[29] he worked online toward a master's degree at the University of Liverpool, England, in 2011.[30] He was interested in Japanese popular culture, had studied the Japanese language,[31] and worked for an anime company that had a resident office in the U.S.[32][33] He also said he had a basic understanding of Mandarin Chinese and was deeply interested in martial arts. At age 20, he listed Buddhism as his religion on a military recruitment form, noting that the choice of agnostic was \"strangely absent.\"[34] In September 2019, as part of interviews relating to the release of his memoir Permanent Record, Snowden revealed to The Guardian that he married Lindsay Mills in a courthouse in Moscow.[7] Snowden has said that, in the 2008 presidential election, he voted for a third-party candidate, though he \"believed in Obama's promises.\" Following the election, he believed President Barack Obama was continuing policies espoused by George W. Bush.[35] In accounts published in June 2013, interviewers noted that Snowden's laptop displayed stickers supporting Internet freedom organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Tor Project.[28] A week after publication of his leaks began, Ars Technica confirmed that Snowden had been an active participant at the site's online forum from 2001 through May 2012, discussing a variety of topics under the pseudonym \"TheTrueHOOHA.\"[36] In a January 2009 entry, TheTrueHOOHA exhibited strong support for the U.S. security state apparatus and said leakers of classified information \"should be shot in the balls.\"[37] However, Snowden disliked Obama's CIA director appointment of Leon Panetta, saying \"Obama just named a fucking politician to run the CIA.\"[38] Snowden was also offended by a possible ban on assault weapons, writing \"Me and all my lunatic, gun-toting NRA compatriots would be on the steps of Congress before the C-Span feed finished.\"[38] Snowden disliked Obama's economic policies, was against Social Security, and favored Ron Paul's call for a return to the gold standard.[38] In 2014, Snowden supported a basic income.[39] Feeling a duty to fight in the Iraq War to help free oppressed people,[28] Snowden enlisted in the United States Army Reserve on May 7, 2004, and became a Special Forces candidate through its 18X enlistment option.[40] He did not complete the training[13] because he broke both legs in a training accident,[41] and was discharged on September 28, 2004.[42] Snowden was then employed for less than a year in 2005 as a security guard at the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Study of Language, a research center sponsored by the National Security Agency (NSA).[43] According to the University, this is not a classified facility,[44] though it is heavily guarded.[45] In June 2014, Snowden told Wired that his job as a security guard required a high-level security clearance, for which he passed a polygraph exam and underwent a stringent background check.[24] After attending a 2006 job-fair focused on intelligence agencies, Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA.[24][46] The Agency assigned him to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.[24] In May 2006, Snowden wrote in Ars Technica that he had no trouble getting work because he was a \"computer wizard\".[34] After distinguishing himself as a junior employee on the top computer team, Snowden was sent to the CIA's secret school for technology specialists, where he lived in a hotel for six months while studying and training full-time.[24] In March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security.[24][47] Assigned to the U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations, a diplomatic mission representing U.S. interests before the UN and other international organizations, Snowden received a diplomatic passport and a four-bedroom apartment near Lake Geneva.[24] According to Greenwald, while there Snowden was \"considered the top technical and cybersecurity expert\" in that country and \"was hand-picked by the CIA to support the president at the 2008 NATO summit in Romania\".[48] Snowden described his CIA experience in Geneva as formative, stating that the CIA deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home. Snowden said that when the latter was arrested, a CIA operative offered to help in exchange for the banker becoming an informant.[49] Ueli Maurer, President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2013, in June of that year publicly disputed Snowden's claims. \"This would mean that the CIA successfully bribed the Geneva police and judiciary. With all due respect, I just can't imagine it,\" said Maurer.[50] In February 2009, Snowden resigned from the CIA.[51] In 2009, Snowden began work as a contractee for Dell,[52] which manages computer systems for multiple government agencies. Assigned to an NSA facility at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo, Snowden instructed top officials and military officers on how to defend their networks from Chinese hackers.[24] Snowden looked into Mass surveillance in China prompted him to investigate and then expose Washington's mass surveillance programme after he was asked in 2009 to brief a conference in Tokyo.[53] During his four years with Dell, he rose from supervising NSA computer system upgrades to working as what his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 termed a \"cyberstrategist\" and an \"expert in cyber counterintelligence\" at several U.S. locations.[54] In 2011, he returned to Maryland, where he spent a year as lead technologist on Dell's CIA account. In that capacity, he was consulted by the chiefs of the CIA's technical branches, including the agency's chief information officer and its chief technology officer.[24] U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the investigation said Snowden began downloading documents describing the government's electronic spying programs while working for Dell in April 2012.[52] Investigators estimated that of the 50,000 to 200,000 documents Snowden gave to Greenwald and Poitras, most were copied by Snowden while working at Dell.[1] In March 2012, Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead technologist for the NSA's information-sharing office.[24] At the time of his departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15 months inside the NSA's Hawaii regional operations center, which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea,[1] the last three of which were with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.[55] While intelligence officials have described his position there as a system administrator, Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst, which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world.[56] On March 15, 2013\u00a0\u2013 three days after what he later called his \"breaking point\" of \"seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress\"[57]\u00a0\u2013 Snowden quit his job at Dell.[58] Although he has said his career high annual salary was $200,000,[59] Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at Booz Allen,[59] where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity.[60] An anonymous source told Reuters that, while in Hawaii, Snowden may have persuaded 20\u201325 co-workers to give him their login credentials by telling them he needed them to do his job.[61] The NSA sent a memo to Congress saying that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal public key infrastructure certificate to gain greater access to the NSA's computer system.[62][63] Snowden disputed the memo,[64] saying in January 2014, \"I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers.\"[65][66] Booz Allen terminated Snowden's employment on June 10, 2013, one month after he had left the country.[67] A former NSA co-worker said that although the NSA was full of smart people, Snowden was a \"genius among geniuses\" who created a widely implemented backup system for the NSA and often pointed out security flaws to the agency. The former colleague said Snowden was given full administrator privileges with virtually unlimited access to NSA data. Snowden was offered a position on the NSA's elite team of hackers, Tailored Access Operations, but turned it down to join Booz Allen.[64] An anonymous source later said that Booz Allen's hiring screeners found possible discrepancies in Snowden's resume but still decided to hire him.[29] Snowden's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stated that he attended computer-related classes at Johns Hopkins University. A spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins said that the university did not find records to show that Snowden attended the university, and suggested that he may instead have attended Advanced Career Technologies, a private for-profit organization that operated as the Computer Career Institute at Johns Hopkins University.[29] The University of Maryland University College acknowledged that Snowden had attended a summer session at a UM campus in Asia. Snowden's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stated that he estimated that he would receive a University of Liverpool computer security master's degree in 2013. The university said that Snowden registered for an online master's degree program in computer security in 2011 but was inactive as a student and had not completed the program.[29] Snowden has said that he had told multiple employees and two supervisors about his concerns, but the NSA disputes his claim.[68] Snowden elaborated in January 2014, saying \"[I] made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co-workers, supervisors, and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen. The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled, but no one was willing to risk their jobs, families, and possibly even freedom to go through what [Thomas Andrews] Drake did.\"[66][69] In March 2014, during testimony to the European Parliament, Snowden wrote that before revealing classified information he had reported \"clearly problematic programs\" to ten officials, who he said did nothing in response.[70] In a May 2014 interview, Snowden told NBC News that after bringing his concerns about the legality of the NSA spying programs to officials, he was told to stay silent on the matter. He asserted that the NSA had copies of emails he sent to their Office of General Counsel, oversight and compliance personnel broaching \"concerns about the NSA's interpretations of its legal authorities. I had raised these complaints not just officially in writing through email, but to my supervisors, to my colleagues, in more than one office.\"[17] In May 2014, U.S. officials released a single email that Snowden had written in April 2013 inquiring about legal authorities but said that they had found no other evidence that Snowden had expressed his concerns to someone in an oversight position.[71] In June 2014, the NSA said it had not been able to find any records of Snowden raising internal complaints about the agency's operations.[72] That same month, Snowden explained that he himself has not produced the communiqu\u00e9s in question because of the ongoing nature of the dispute, disclosing for the first time that \"I am working with the NSA in regard to these records and we're going back and forth, so I don't want to reveal everything that will come out.\"[73] In his May 2014 interview with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government of trying to use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a \"low level analyst.\" In his words, he was \"trained as a spy in the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas\u2014pretending to work in a job that I'm not\u2014and even being assigned a name that was not mine.\" He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure \"in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading.\"[17] In a June interview with Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he \"was actually functioning at a very senior level.\"[74] In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, \"I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don\u2019t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting.\"[75] Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, \"I would sit down with the CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job to come up with a way to fix them.\"[24] Of his time as an NSA analyst, directing the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment when he and his colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly \"thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense\u2014for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people.\" As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the \"fringe benefits\" of the work.[76] The exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown,[77] but Australian officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence files[78] and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British intelligence files.[79] NSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 NSA documents.[80] Later estimates provided by U.S. officials were on the order of 1.7 million,[81] a number that originally came from Department of Defense talking points.[82] In July 2014, The Washington Post reported on a cache previously provided by Snowden from domestic NSA operations consisting of \"roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long, and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts.\"[83] A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report declassified in June 2015 said that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files, more than he downloaded from the NSA.[82] In March 2014, Army General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee, \"The vast majority of the documents that Snowden ... exfiltrated from our highest levels of security ... had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities. The vast majority of those were related to our military capabilities, operations, tactics, techniques and procedures.\"[84] When asked in a May 2014 interview to quantify the number of documents Snowden stole, retired NSA director Keith Alexander said there was no accurate way of counting what he took, but Snowden may have downloaded more than a million documents.[85] According to Snowden, he did not indiscriminately turn over documents to journalists, stating that \"I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest. There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over\"[28] and that \"I have to screen everything before releasing it to journalists ... If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country.\"[60] Despite these measures, the improper redaction of a document by the New York Times resulted in the exposure of intelligence activity against al-Qaeda.[86] In June 2014, the NSA's recently installed director, U.S. Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done was not significant enough to conclude that \"the sky is falling.\"[87] Nevertheless, in February 2015, Rogers said that Snowden's disclosures had a material impact on the NSA's detection and evaluation of terrorist activities worldwide.[88] On June 14, 2015, UK's Sunday Times reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence services had decrypted more than 1 million classified files in the Snowden cache, forcing the UK's MI6 intelligence agency to move agents out of live operations in hostile countries. Sir David Omand, a former director of the UK's GCHQ intelligence gathering agency, described it as a huge strategic setback that was harming Britain, America, and their NATO allies. The Sunday Times said it was not clear whether Russia and China stole Snowden's data or whether Snowden voluntarily handed it over to remain at liberty in Hong Kong and Moscow.[89][90] In April 2015 the Henry Jackson Society, a British neoconservative think tank, published a report claiming that Snowden's intelligence leaks negatively impacted Britain's ability to fight terrorism and organized crime.[91] Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International, criticized the report for, in his opinion, presuming that the public became concerned about privacy only after Snowden's disclosures.[92] Snowden's decision to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March 2007 posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station.[93] Snowden first made contact with Glenn Greenwald, a journalist working at The Guardian, on December 1, 2012.[94][95] He contacted Greenwald anonymously as \"Cincinnatus\"[96] and said he had sensitive documents that he would like to share.[97] Greenwald found the measures that the source asked him to take to secure their communications, such as encrypting email, too annoying to employ. Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras in January 2013.[98] According to Poitras, Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her New York Times article about NSA whistleblower William Binney.[99] What originally attracted Snowden to both Greenwald and Poitras was a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras's controversial films had made her a target of the government.[97] Greenwald began working with Snowden in either February[100] or April 2013, after Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New York City, at which point Snowden began providing documents to them.[94] Barton Gellman, writing for The Washington Post, says his first direct contact was on May 16, 2013.[101] According to Gellman, Snowden approached Greenwald after the Post declined to guarantee publication within 72 hours of all 41 PowerPoint slides that Snowden had leaked exposing the PRISM electronic data mining program, and to publish online an encrypted code allowing Snowden to later prove that he was the source.[101] Snowden communicated using encrypted email,[98] and going by the codename \"Verax\". He asked not to be quoted at length for fear of identification by stylometry.[101] According to Gellman, prior to their first meeting in person, Snowden wrote, \"I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions, and that the return of this information to the public marks my end.\"[101] Snowden also told Gellman that until the articles were published, the journalists working with him would also be at mortal risk from the United States Intelligence Community \"if they think you are the single point of failure that could stop this disclosure and make them the sole owner of this information.\"[101] In May 2013, Snowden was permitted temporary leave from his position at the NSA in Hawaii, on the pretext of receiving treatment for his epilepsy.[28] In mid-May, Snowden gave an electronic interview to Poitras and Jacob Appelbaum which was published weeks later by Der Spiegel.[102] After disclosing the copied documents, Snowden promised that nothing would stop subsequent disclosures. In June 2013, he said, \"All I can say right now is the US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped.\"[103] On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong,[104] where he was staying when the initial articles based on the leaked documents were published,[105] beginning with The Guardian on June 5.[106] Greenwald later said Snowden disclosed 9,000 to 10,000 documents.[107] Within months, documents had been obtained and published by media outlets worldwide, most notably The Guardian (Britain), Der Spiegel (Germany), The Washington Post and The New York Times (U.S.), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), and similar outlets in Sweden, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Australia.[108] In 2014, NBC broke its first story based on the leaked documents.[109] In February 2014, for reporting based on Snowden's leaks, journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman and The Guardian\u2032s Ewen MacAskill were honored as co-recipients of the 2013 George Polk Award, which they dedicated to Snowden.[110] The NSA reporting by these journalists also earned The Guardian and The Washington Post the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service[111] for exposing the \"widespread surveillance\" and for helping to spark a \"huge public debate about the extent of the government's spying\". The Guardian's chief editor, Alan Rusbridger, credited Snowden for having performed a public service.[112] The ongoing publication of leaked documents has revealed previously unknown details of a global surveillance apparatus run by the United States' NSA[115] in close cooperation with three of its four Five Eyes partners: Australia's ASD,[116] the UK's GCHQ,[117] and Canada's CSEC.[118] On June 5, 2013, media reports documenting the existence and functions of classified surveillance programs and their scope began and continued throughout the entire year. The first program to be revealed was PRISM, which allows for court-approved direct access to Americans' Google and Yahoo accounts, reported from both The Washington Post and The Guardian published one hour apart.[113][119][120] Barton Gellman of The Washington Post was the first journalist to report on Snowden's documents. He said the U.S. government urged him not to specify by name which companies were involved, but Gellman decided that to name them \"would make it real to Americans.\"[121] Reports also revealed details of Tempora, a British black-ops surveillance program run by the NSA's British partner, GCHQ.[119][122] The initial reports included details about NSA call database, Boundless Informant, and of a secret court order requiring Verizon to hand the NSA millions of Americans' phone records daily,[123] the surveillance of French citizens' phone and Internet records, and those of \"high-profile individuals from the world of business or politics.\"[124][125][126] XKeyscore, an analytical tool that allows for collection of \"almost anything done on the internet,\" was described by The Guardian as a program that shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements: \"I, sitting at my desk [could] wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email.\"[127] The NSA's top-secret black budget, obtained from Snowden by The Washington Post, exposed the successes and failures of the 16 spy agencies comprising the U.S. intelligence community,[128] and revealed that the NSA was paying U.S. private tech companies for clandestine access to their communications networks.[129] The agencies were allotted $52 billion for the 2013 fiscal year.[130] It was revealed that the NSA was harvesting millions of email and instant messaging contact lists,[131] searching email content,[132] tracking and mapping the location of cell phones,[133] undermining attempts at encryption via Bullrun[134][135] and that the agency was using cookies to piggyback on the same tools used by Internet advertisers \"to pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster surveillance.\"[136] The NSA was shown to be secretly accessing Yahoo and Google data centers to collect information from hundreds of millions of account holders worldwide by tapping undersea cables using the MUSCULAR surveillance program.[113][114] The NSA, the CIA and GCHQ spied on users of Second Life, Xbox Live and World of Warcraft, and attempted to recruit would-be informants from the sites, according to documents revealed in December 2013.[137][138] Leaked documents showed NSA agents also spied on their own \"love interests,\" a practice NSA employees termed LOVEINT.[139][140] The NSA was shown to be tracking the online sexual activity of people they termed \"radicalizers\" in order to discredit them.[141] Following the revelation of Black Pearl, a program targeting private networks, the NSA was accused of extending beyond its primary mission of national security. The agency's intelligence-gathering operations had targeted, among others, oil giant Petrobras, Brazil's largest company.[142] The NSA and the GCHQ were also shown to be surveilling charities including UNICEF and M\u00e9decins du Monde, as well as allies such as European Commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[143] In October 2013, Glenn Greenwald said \"the most shocking and significant stories are the ones we are still working on, and have yet to publish.\"[144] In November, The Guardian's editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger said that only one percent of the documents had been published.[145] In December, Australia's Minister for Defence David Johnston said his government assumed the worst was yet to come.[146] By October 2013, Snowden's disclosures had created tensions[147][148] between the U.S. and some of its close allies after they revealed that the U.S. had spied on Brazil, France, Mexico,[149] Britain,[150] China,[151] Germany,[152] and Spain,[153] as well as 35 world leaders,[154] most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said \"spying among friends\" was unacceptable[155][156] and compared the NSA with the Stasi.[157] Leaked documents published by Der Spiegel in 2014 appeared to show that the NSA had targeted 122 high-ranking leaders.[158] An NSA mission statement titled \"SIGINT Strategy 2012-2016\" affirmed that the NSA had plans for continued expansion of surveillance activities. Their stated goal was to \"dramatically increase mastery of the global network\" and to acquire adversaries' data from \"anyone, anytime, anywhere.\"[159] Leaked slides revealed in Greenwald's book No Place to Hide, released in May 2014, showed that the NSA's stated objective was to \"Collect it All,\" \"Process it All,\" \"Exploit it All,\" \"Partner it All,\" \"Sniff it All\" and \"Know it All.\"[160] Snowden said in a January 2014 interview with German television that the NSA does not limit its data collection to national security issues, accusing the agency of conducting industrial espionage. Using the example of German company Siemens, he said, \"If there's information at Siemens that's beneficial to US national interests\u2014even if it doesn't have anything to do with national security\u2014then they'll take that information nevertheless.\"[161] In the wake of Snowden's revelations and in response to an inquiry from the Left Party, Germany's domestic security agency Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (BfV) investigated and found no concrete evidence that the U.S. conducted economic or industrial espionage in Germany.[162] In February 2014, during testimony to the European Union, Snowden said of the remaining undisclosed programs, \"I will leave the public interest determinations as to which of these may be safely disclosed to responsible journalists in coordination with government stakeholders.\"[163] In March 2014, documents disclosed by Glenn Greenwald writing for The Intercept showed the NSA, in cooperation with the GCHQ, has plans to infect millions of computers with malware using a program called TURBINE.[164] Revelations included information about QUANTUMHAND, a program through which the NSA set up a fake Facebook server to intercept connections.[164] According to a report in The Washington Post in July 2014, relying on information furnished by Snowden, 90% of those placed under surveillance in the U.S. are ordinary Americans, and are not the intended targets. The newspaper said it had examined documents including emails, message texts, and online accounts, that support the claim.[165] In an August 2014 interview, Snowden for the first time disclosed a cyberwarfare program in the works, codenamed MonsterMind, that would automate detection of a foreign cyberattack as it began and automatically fire back. \"These attacks can be spoofed,\" said Snowden. \"You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?\"[24] Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.[1] After the disclosures, his identity was made public by The Guardian at his request on June 9, 2013.[100] \"I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,\" he said. \"My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.\"[104] Snowden said he wanted to \"embolden others to step forward\" by demonstrating that \"they can win.\"[101] He also said that the system for reporting problems did not work. \"You have to report wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.\" He cited a lack of whistleblower protection for government contractors, the use of the Espionage Act of 1917 to prosecute leakers, and his belief that had he used internal mechanisms to \"sound the alarm,\" his revelations \"would have been buried forever.\"[93][166] In December 2013, upon learning that a U.S. federal judge had ruled the collection of U.S. phone metadata conducted by the NSA as likely unconstitutional, Snowden said, \"I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts ... today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights.\"[167] In January 2014, Snowden said his \"breaking point\" was \"seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress.\"[57] This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013\u2014three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald,[94] and nine months after the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads during the summer of 2012[1]\u2014in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans.[168] Snowden said, \"There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs.\"[169] In March 2014, Snowden said he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing.[70] In May 2013, Snowden took a leave of absence, telling his supervisors he was returning to the mainland for epilepsy treatment, but instead left Hawaii for Hong Kong[170] where he arrived on May 20. Snowden told Guardian reporters in June that he had been in his room at the Mira Hotel since his arrival in the city, rarely going out. On June 10, correspondent Ewen MacAskill said Snowden had left his hotel only briefly three times since May 20.[171] Snowden vowed to challenge any extradition attempt by the U.S. government, and engaged a Hong Kong-based Canadian human rights lawyer Robert Tibbo as a legal adviser.[1][172][173] Snowden told the South China Morning Post that he planned to remain in Hong Kong for as long as its government would permit.[174][175] Snowden also told the Post that \"the United States government has committed a tremendous number of crimes against Hong Kong [and] the PRC as well,\"[176] going on to identify Chinese Internet Protocol addresses that the NSA monitored and stating that the NSA collected text-message data for Hong Kong residents. Glenn Greenwald said Snowden was motivated by a need to \"ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.\"[177] After leaving the Mira Hotel, Snowden was housed for two weeks in a number of apartments by other refugees seeking asylum in Hong Kong, an arrangement set up by Tibbo to hide from the US authorities.[178][179] The Russian newspaper Kommersant nevertheless reported that Snowden was living at the Russian consulate shortly before his departure from Hong Kong to Moscow.[180] Ben Wizner, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and legal adviser to Snowden, said in January 2014, \"Every news organization in the world has been trying to confirm that story. They haven't been able to, because it's false.\"[181] Likewise rejecting the Kommersant story was Anatoly Kucherena, who became Snowden's lawyer in July 2013 when Snowden asked him for help in seeking temporary asylum in Russia.[182] Kucherena said Snowden did not communicate with Russian diplomats while he was in Hong Kong.[183][184] In early September 2013, however, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that, a few days before boarding a plane to Moscow, Snowden met in Hong Kong with Russian diplomatic representatives.[185] On June 22, 18 days after publication of Snowden's NSA documents began, officials revoked his U.S. passport.[186] On June 23, Snowden boarded the commercial Aeroflot flight SU213 to Moscow, accompanied by Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks.[187][188] Hong Kong authorities said that Snowden had not been detained for the U.S. because the request had not fully complied with Hong Kong law,[189][190] and there was no legal basis to prevent Snowden from leaving.[191][192][Notes 1] On June 24, a U.S. State Department spokesman rejected the explanation of technical noncompliance, accusing the Hong Kong government of deliberately releasing a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant and after having sufficient time to prohibit his travel.[195] That same day, Julian Assange said that WikiLeaks had paid for Snowden's lodging in Hong Kong and his flight out.[196] In October 2013, Snowden said that before flying to Moscow, he gave all the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, and kept no copies for himself.[93] In January 2014, he told a German TV interviewer that he gave all of his information to American journalists reporting on American issues.[57] During his first American TV interview, in May 2014, Snowden said he had protected himself from Russian leverage by destroying the material he had been holding before landing in Moscow.[17] In January 2019, Vanessa Rodel, one of the refugees who had housed Snowden in Hong Kong, and her 7-year-old daughter were granted asylum by Canada. Five other people who helped Snowden still remain in Hong Kong awaiting a response to their asylum request.[197] On June 23, 2013, Snowden landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.[198] WikiLeaks said he was on a circuitous but safe route to asylum in Ecuador.[199] Snowden had a seat reserved to continue to Cuba[200] but did not board that onward flight, saying in a January 2014 interview that he intended to transit through Russia but was stopped en route. He asserted \"a planeload of reporters documented the seat I was supposed to be in\" when he was ticketed for Havana, but the U.S. cancelled his passport.[181] He said the U.S. wanted him to stay in Moscow so \"they could say, 'He's a Russian spy.'\"[74] Greenwald's account differed on the point of Snowden being already ticketed. According to Greenwald, Snowden's passport was valid when he departed Hong Kong but was revoked during the hours he was in transit to Moscow, preventing him from obtaining a ticket to leave Russia. Greenwald said Snowden was thus forced to stay in Moscow and seek asylum.[201] According to one Russian report, Snowden planned to fly from Moscow through Havana to Latin America; however, Cuba told Moscow it would not allow the Aeroflot plane carrying Snowden to land.[183] Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that Cuba had a change of heart after receiving pressure from U.S. officials,[202] leaving him stuck in the transit zone because at the last minute Havana told officials in Moscow not to allow him on the flight.[203] The Washington Post contrasted this version with what it called \"widespread speculation\" that Russia never intended to let Snowden proceed.[204] Fidel Castro called claims that Cuba would have blocked Snowden's entry a \"lie\" and a \"libel.\"[200] Describing Snowden's arrival in Moscow as a surprise and likening it to \"an unwanted Christmas gift,\"[205] Russian president Putin said that Snowden remained in the transit area of Sheremetyevo Airport, had committed no crime in Russia, was free to leave and should do so.[206] Putin denied that Russia's intelligence agencies had worked or were working with Snowden.[205] Following Snowden's arrival in Moscow, the White House expressed disappointment in Hong Kong's decision to allow him to leave.[207][208][195] An anonymous U.S. official not authorized to discuss the matter told AP Snowden's passport had been revoked before he left Hong Kong, but that a senior official in a country or airline could order subordinates to overlook the withdrawn passport.[209] U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that Snowden's passport was cancelled \"within two hours\" of the charges against Snowden being made public[3] which was Friday, June 21.[2] In a July 1 statement, Snowden said, \"Although I am convicted of nothing, [the U.S. government] has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.\"[210] Four countries offered Snowden permanent asylum: Ecuador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Venezuela.[211] No direct flights between Moscow and Venezuela, Bolivia or Nicaragua existed, however, and the U.S. pressured countries along his route to hand him over. Snowden said in July 2013 that he decided to bid for asylum in Russia because he felt there was no safe way to reach Latin America.[212] Snowden said he remained in Russia because \"when we were talking about possibilities for asylum in Latin America, the United States forced down the Bolivian President's plane\", citing the Morales plane incident. On the issue, he said \"some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law, and this behavior persists today. This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights.\"[213] He said that he would travel from Russia if there was no interference from the U.S. government.[181] Four months after Snowden received asylum in Russia, Julian Assange commented, \"While Venezuela and Ecuador could protect him in the short term, over the long term there could be a change in government. In Russia, he's safe, he's well-regarded, and that is not likely to change. That was my advice to Snowden, that he would be physically safest in Russia.\"[170] According to Snowden, \"the CIA has a very powerful presence [in Latin America] and the governments and the security services there are relatively much less capable than, say, Russia.... they could have basically snatched me....\"[214] In an October 2014 interview with The Nation magazine, Snowden reiterated that he had originally intended to travel to Latin America: \"A lot of people are still unaware that I never intended to end up in Russia.\" According to Snowden, the U.S. government \"waited until I departed Hong Kong to cancel my passport in order to trap me in Russia.\" Snowden added, \"If they really wanted to capture me, they would've allowed me to travel to Latin America, because the CIA can operate with impunity down there. They did not want that; they chose to keep me in Russia.\"[215] On July 1, 2013, president Evo Morales of Bolivia, who had been attending a conference in Russia, suggested during an interview with Russia Today that he would consider a request by Snowden for asylum.[216] The following day, Morales's plane, en route to Bolivia, was rerouted to Austria and landed there, after France, Spain, and Italy denied access to their airspace. While the plane was parked in Vienna, the Spanish ambassador to Austria arrived with two embassy personnel and asked to search the plane but they were denied permission by Morales himself.[217] U.S. officials had raised suspicions that Snowden may have been on board.[218] Morales blamed the U.S. for putting pressure on European countries, and said that the grounding of his plane was a violation of international law.[219] In April 2015, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, Mar\u00eda Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Julian Assange of inadvertently putting Morales's life at risk by intentionally providing to the U.S. false rumors that Snowden was on Morales's plane. Assange responded that \"we weren't expecting this outcome. The result was caused by the United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened.\"[220][221] Snowden applied for political asylum to 21 countries.[222][223] A statement attributed to him contended that the U.S. administration, and specifically Vice President Joe Biden, had pressured the governments to refuse his asylum petitions. Biden had telephoned President Rafael Correa days prior to Snowden's remarks, asking the Ecuadorian leader not to grant Snowden asylum.[224] Ecuador had initially offered Snowden a temporary travel document but later withdrew it,[225] and Correa later called the offer a mistake.[226] In a July 1 statement published by WikiLeaks, Snowden accused the U.S. government of \"using citizenship as a weapon\" and using what he described as \"old, bad tools of political aggression.\" Citing Obama's promise to not allow \"wheeling and dealing\" over the case, Snowden commented, \"This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile.\"[227] Several days later, WikiLeaks announced that Snowden had applied for asylum in six additional countries, but declined to name them, alleging attempted U.S. interference.[228] After evaluating the law and Snowden's situation, the French interior ministry rejected his request for asylum.[229] Poland refused to process his application because it did not conform to legal procedure.[230] Brazil's Foreign Ministry said the government planned no response to Snowden's asylum request. Germany and India rejected Snowden's application outright, while Austria, Ecuador, Finland, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain said he must be on their territory to apply.[231][232][233] In November 2014, Germany announced that Snowden had not renewed his previously denied request and was not being considered for asylum.[234] Glenn Greenwald later reported that Sigmar Gabriel, Vice-Chancellor of Germany, told him the U.S. government had threatened to stop sharing intelligence if Germany offered Snowden asylum or arranged for his travel there.[235] Putin said on July 1, 2013, that if Snowden wanted to be granted asylum in Russia, he would be required to \"stop his work aimed at harming our American partners.\"[236] A spokesman for Putin subsequently said that Snowden had withdrawn his asylum application upon learning of the conditions.[237] In a July 12 meeting at Sheremetyevo Airport with representatives of human rights organizations and lawyers, organized in part by the Russian government,[238] Snowden said he was accepting all offers of asylum that he had already received or would receive. He added that Venezuela's grant of asylum formalized his asylee status, removing any basis for state interference with his right to asylum.[239] He also said he would request asylum in Russia until he resolved his travel problems.[240] Russian Federal Migration Service officials confirmed on July 16 that Snowden had submitted an application for temporary asylum.[241] On July 24, Kucherena said his client wanted to find work in Russia, travel and create a life for himself, and had already begun learning Russian.[242] Amid media reports in early July 2013 attributed to U.S. administration sources that Obama's one-on-one meeting with Putin, ahead of a G20 meeting in St Petersburg scheduled for September, was in doubt due to Snowden's protracted sojourn in Russia,[243] top U.S. officials repeatedly made it clear to Moscow that Snowden should immediately be returned to the United States to face charges for the unauthorized leaking of classified information.[244][245][246] His Russian lawyer said Snowden needed asylum because he faced persecution by the U.S. government and feared \"that he could be subjected to torture and capital punishment.\"[247] In a letter to Russian Minister of Justice Aleksandr Konovalov dated July 23, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder repudiated Snowden's claim to refugee status, and offered a limited validity passport good for direct return to the U.S.[248] He further asserted that Snowden would not be subject to torture or the death penalty, and would receive trial in a civilian court with proper legal counsel.[249] The same day, the Russian president's spokesman reiterated that his government would not hand over Snowden, noting that Putin was not personally involved in the matter and that it was being handled through talks between the FBI and Russia's FSB.[250] On June 14, 2013, United States federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Snowden, charging him with theft of government property and two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 through unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.[2][248] Each of the three charges carries a maximum possible prison term of ten years. The charge was initially secret and was unsealed a week later. Snowden was asked in a January 2014 interview about returning to the U.S. to face the charges in court, as Obama had suggested a few days prior. Snowden explained why he rejected the request: What he doesn't say are that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court to the public and convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. ... So it's, I would say, illustrative that the President would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial.[57][251] Snowden's legal representative, Jesselyn Radack, wrote that \"the Espionage Act effectively hinders a person from defending himself before a jury in an open court.\" She said that the \"arcane World War I law\" was never meant to prosecute whistleblowers, but rather spies who betrayed their trust by selling secrets to enemies for profit. Non-profit betrayals were not considered.[252] On September 17, 2019, the United States filed a lawsuit against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA.[253] The complaint alleges that Snowden violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir Permanent Record. The complaint lists the publishers Macmillan and Holtzbrink as relief-defendants.[254] On June 23, 2013, Snowden landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport aboard a commercial Aeroflot flight from Hong Kong.[255][187][256] On August 1, after 39 days in the transit section, he left the airport and was granted temporary asylum in Russia for one year.[257] A year later, his temporary asylum having expired, Snowden received a three-year residency permit allowing him to travel freely within Russia and to go abroad for up to three months. He was not granted permanent political asylum.[258] In January 2017, a spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry wrote on Facebook that Snowden's asylum, which was due to expire in 2017, was extended by \"a couple more years\".[259][260] Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said the extension was valid until 2020.[261] As of October 2019, Snowden had been granted permanent residency in Russia, which is renewed every three years. He secretly married Lindsay Mills in 2017. By 2019 he no longer felt the need to be disguised in public and lived what was described as a \"more or less normal life\", able to travel around Russia and make a living from speaking arrangements (locally and over the internet). His memoir Permanent Record was released internationally, and while U.S. royalties were expected to be seized, he was able to receive the advance.[6] According to Snowden, \"One of the things that is lost in all the problematic politics of the Russian government is the fact this is one of the most beautiful countries in the world\" with \"friendly\" and \"warm\" people.[6] In another interview, Snowden went on to say: \"There's a way to criticize the Russian government's policies without criticizing the Russian people who are ordinary people, who just want to have a happy life; they just want to do better. They want the same things that you do.\"[262] A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero,[263][264][265] a whistleblower,[266][267][268][269] a dissident,[270] a patriot,[271][272][273] and a traitor.[274][275][276][277] Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg called Snowden's release of NSA material the most significant leak in U.S. history.[278][279] Numerous high-ranking current or former U.S. government officials reacted publicly to Snowden's disclosures. In the U.S., Snowden's actions precipitated an intense debate on privacy and warrantless domestic surveillance.[294][295] President Obama was initially dismissive of Snowden, saying \"I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.\"[296][297][298] In August 2013, Obama rejected the suggestion that Snowden was a patriot,[299] and in November said that \"the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it.\"[300] In June 2013, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont shared a \"must read\" news story on his blog by Ron Fournier, stating \"Love him or hate him, we all owe Snowden our thanks for forcing upon the nation an important debate. But the debate shouldn't be about him. It should be about the gnawing questions his actions raised from the shadows.\"[301] In 2015, Sanders stated that \"Snowden played a very important role in educating the American public\" and that although Snowden should not go unpunished for breaking the law, \"that education should be taken into consideration before the sentencing.\"[302] Snowden said in December 2013 that he was \"inspired by the global debate\" ignited by the leaks and that NSA's \"culture of indiscriminate global espionage ... is collapsing.\"[303] At the end of 2013, however, The Washington Post noted that the public debate and its offshoots had produced no meaningful change in policy, with the status quo continuing.[139] In 2016, on The Axe Files podcast, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that Snowden \"performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made.\" Holder nevertheless said that Snowden's actions were inappropriate and illegal.[304] In September 2016, the bipartisan U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence completed a review of the Snowden disclosures and said that the federal government would have to spend millions of dollars responding to the fallout from Snowden's disclosures.[305] The report also said that \"the public narrative popularized by Snowden and his allies is rife with falsehoods, exaggerations, and crucial omissions.\"[306] The report was denounced by Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman, who called it \"aggressively dishonest\" and \"contemptuous of fact.\"[307] In August 2013, President Obama said that he had called for a review of U.S. surveillance activities before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations,[299] and announced that he was directing DNI James Clapper \"to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies.\"[308][309] In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using backdoors in hardware or software.[310] Panel member Geoffrey R. Stone said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks.[311] On June 6, 2013, in the wake of Snowden's leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him. In Klayman v. Obama, Judge Richard J. Leon referred to the NSA's \"almost-Orwellian technology\" and ruled the bulk telephone metadata program to be probably unconstitutional.[312] Snowden later described Judge Leon's decision as vindication.[313] On June 11, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, alleging that the NSA's phone records program was unconstitutional. In December 2013, ten days after Judge Leon's ruling, Judge William H. Pauley III came to the opposite conclusion. In ACLU v. Clapper, although acknowledging that privacy concerns are not trivial, Pauley found that the potential benefits of surveillance outweigh these considerations and ruled that the NSA's collection of phone data is legal.[314] Gary Schmitt, former staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote that \"The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program\u2014a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff.\"[315] On May 7, 2015, in the case of ACLU v. Clapper, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that Section 215 of the Patriot Act did not authorize the NSA to collect Americans' calling records in bulk, as exposed by Snowden in 2013. The decision voided U.S. District Judge William Pauley's December 2013 finding that the NSA program was lawful, and remanded the case to him for further review. The appeals court did not rule on the constitutionality of the bulk surveillance, and declined to enjoin the program, noting the pending expiration of relevant parts of the Patriot Act. Circuit Judge Gerard E. Lynch wrote that, given the national security interests at stake, it was prudent to give Congress an opportunity to debate and decide the matter.[316] On June 2, 2015, the U.S. Senate passed, and President Obama signed, the USA Freedom Act which restored in modified form several provisions of the Patriot Act that had expired the day before, while for the first time imposing some limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication data on U.S. citizens by American intelligence agencies. The new restrictions were widely seen as stemming from Snowden's revelations.[317][318] Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic security agency, speculated that Snowden could have been working for the Russian government.[319][320] Snowden rejected this insinuation,[321] speculating on Twitter in German that \"it cannot be proven if Maa\u00dfen is an agent of the SVR or FSB.\"[322] Crediting the Snowden leaks, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted Resolution 68/167 in December 2013. The non-binding resolution denounced unwarranted digital surveillance and included a symbolic declaration of the right of all individuals to online privacy.[323][324][325] Support for Snowden came from Latin American leaders including the Argentinian President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, Bolivian President Evo Morales, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.[326][327] In an official report published in October 2015, the United Nations special rapporteur for the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of speech, Professor David Kaye, criticized the U.S. government's harsh treatment of, and bringing criminal charges against, whistleblowers, including Edward Snowden. The report found that Snowden's revelations were important for people everywhere and made \"a deep and lasting impact on law, policy and politics.\"[328][329] The European Parliament invited Snowden to make a pre-recorded video appearance to aid their NSA investigation.[330][331] Snowden gave written testimony in which he said that he was seeking asylum in the EU, but that he was told by European Parliamentarians that the U.S. would not allow EU partners to make such an offer.[332] He told the Parliament that the NSA was working with the security agencies of EU states to \"get access to as much data of EU citizens as possible.\"[333] The NSA's Foreign Affairs Division, he claimed, lobbies the EU and other countries to change their laws, allowing for \"everyone in the country\" to be spied on legally.[334] In July 2014, Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, told a news conference in Geneva that the U.S. should abandon its efforts to prosecute Snowden, since his leaks were in the public interest.[335] Surveys conducted by news outlets and professional polling organizations found that American public opinion was divided on Snowden's disclosures, and that those polled in Canada and Europe were more supportive of Snowden than respondents in the U.S. although more Americans have grown more supportive of Snowden's disclosure. In Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Spain more than 80% of people familiar with Snowden view him positively.[336] For his global surveillance disclosures, Snowden has been honored by publications and organizations based in Europe and the United States. He was voted as The Guardian's person of the year 2013, garnering four times the number of votes as any other candidate.[337] In March 2014, Snowden spoke at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive technology conference in Austin, Texas, in front of 3,500 attendees. He participated by teleconference carried over multiple routers running the Google Hangouts platform. On-stage moderators were Christopher Soghoian and Snowden's legal counsel Wizner, both from the ACLU.[338] Snowden said that the NSA was \"setting fire to the future of the internet,\" and that the SXSW audience was \"the firefighters.\"[339][340][341] Attendees could use Twitter to send questions to Snowden, who answered one by saying that information gathered by corporations was much less dangerous than that gathered by a government agency, because \"governments have the power to deprive you of your rights.\"[339] Representative Mike Pompeo (R-KS) of the House Intelligence Committee, and later director of the CIA, had tried unsuccessfully to get the SXSW management to cancel Snowden's appearance; instead, SXSW director Hugh Forrest said that the NSA was welcome to respond to Snowden at the 2015 conference.[339] Later that month, Snowden appeared by teleconference at the TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. Represented on stage by a robot with a video screen, video camera, microphones and speakers, Snowden conversed with TED curator Chris Anderson, and told the attendees that online businesses should act quickly to encrypt their websites. He described the NSA's PRISM program as the U.S. government using businesses to collect data for them, and that the NSA \"intentionally misleads corporate partners\" using, as an example, the Bullrun decryption program to create backdoor access.[342] Snowden said he would gladly return to the U.S. if given immunity from prosecution, but that he was more concerned about alerting the public about abuses of government authority.[342] Anderson invited Internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee on stage to converse with Snowden, who said that he would support Berners-Lee's concept of an \"internet Magna Carta\" to \"encode our values in the structure of the internet.\"[342][343] On September 15, 2014, Snowden appeared via remote video link, along with Julian Assange, on Kim Dotcom's Moment of Truth town hall meeting held in Auckland.[344] He made a similar video link appearance on February 2, 2015, along with Greenwald, as the keynote speaker at the World Affairs Conference at Upper Canada College in Toronto.[345] In March 2015, while speaking at the FIFDH (international human rights film festival) he made a public appeal for Switzerland to grant him asylum, saying he would like to return to live in Geneva, where he once worked undercover for the Central Intelligence Agency.[346] In April 2015, John Oliver, the host of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, flew to Moscow to Interview Edward Snowden.[347] On November 10, 2015, Snowden appeared at the Newseum, via remote video link, for PEN American Center's \"Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security and Free Expression,\" event.[348] In 2015, Snowden earned over $200,000 from digital speaking engagements in the U.S.[349] On March 19, 2016, Snowden delivered the opening keynote address of the LibrePlanet conference, a meeting of international free software activists and developers presented by the Free Software Foundation. The conference was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was the first such time Snowden spoke via teleconference using a full free software stack, end-to-end.[jargon][350][351][352][353] On July 21, 2016, Snowden and hardware hacker Bunnie Huang, in a talk at MIT Media Lab's Forbidden Research event, published research for a smartphone case, the so-called Introspection Engine, that would monitor signals received and sent by that phone to provide an alert to the user if his or her phone is transmitting or receiving information when it shouldn't be (for example when it's turned off or in airplane mode), a feature described by Snowden to be useful for journalists or activists operating under hostile governments that would otherwise track their activities through their phones.[354][355][356][357][358] In July 2013, media critic Jay Rosen defined The Snowden Effect as \"Direct and indirect gains in public knowledge from the cascade of events and further reporting that followed Edward Snowden's leaks of classified information about the surveillance state in the U.S.\"[359] In December 2013, The Nation wrote that Snowden had sparked an overdue debate about national security and individual privacy.[360] In Forbes, the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S. Congress in opposition to the massive post-9/11 domestic intelligence gathering system.[361] In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the Pew Research Center found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America.[362] On November 2, 2018, Snowden provided a court declaration in Jewel v. National Security Agency.[363][364][365] Snowden's impact as a public figure has been felt in cinema,[368][369] advertising,[370] video games,[371][372] literature,[373][374] music,[375][376][377] statuary,[378][379] and social media.[380][381] Snowden gave Channel 4's \"Alternative Christmas Message\" in December 2013.[6] The film Snowden, based on Snowden's leaking of classified US government material, was released in 2016.[382]",

His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments, and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy.\nIn 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA.[1] Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times.\nOn Snowden's 30th birthday, June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property,[2] following which the Department of State revoked his passport.[3] Two days later, he flew into Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, where Russian authorities noted that his U.S. passport had been cancelled, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, and repeated extensions have permitted him to stay at least until 2020. In early 2016, he became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a San Francisco-based organization that states its purpose is to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance.[4] As of 2017 he is married and living in Moscow.[5][6]\nOn September 17, 2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published.[7] On the first day of publication, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit against Snowden over publication of his memoir, alleging he had breached nondisclosure agreements signed with the U.S. federal government.[8] Former The Guardian national security reporter Ewen MacAskill called the civil lawsuit a \"huge mistake\", noting that the \"UK ban of Spycatcher 30 years ago created huge demand\".[9][10] The memoir was listed as no. 1 on Amazon's bestseller list that same day.[11] In an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now!  on September 26, 2019, Snowden clarified he considers himself a \"whistleblower\" as opposed to a \"leaker\" as he considers \"a leaker only distributes information for personal gain\".[12]\nEdward Joseph Snowden was born on June 21, 1983,[13] in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.[14] His maternal grandfather, Edward J. Barrett,[15][16] a rear admiral in the U.S. Coast Guard, became a senior official with the FBI and was at the Pentagon in 2001 during the September 11 attacks.[17] Snowden's father, Lonnie, was also an officer in the Coast Guard,[18] and his mother, Elizabeth, is a clerk at the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.[19][20][21][22][23] His older sister, Jessica, was a lawyer at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C. Edward Snowden said that he had expected to work for the federal government, as had the rest of his family.[24] His parents divorced in 2001,[25] and his father remarried.[26] Snowden scored above 145 on two separate IQ tests.[24]\nIn the early 1990s, while still in grade school, Snowden moved with his family to the area of Fort Meade, Maryland.[27] Mononucleosis caused him to miss high school for almost nine months.[24] Rather than returning to school, he passed the GED test[28] and took classes at Anne Arundel Community College.[21] Although Snowden had no undergraduate college degree,[29] he worked online toward a master's degree at the University of Liverpool, England, in 2011.[30] He was interested in Japanese popular culture, had studied the Japanese language,[31] and worked for an anime company that had a resident office in the U.S.[32][33] He also said he had a basic understanding of Mandarin Chinese and was deeply interested in martial arts. At age 20, he listed Buddhism as his religion on a military recruitment form, noting that the choice of agnostic was \"strangely absent.\"[34] In September 2019, as part of interviews relating to the release of his memoir Permanent Record, Snowden revealed to The Guardian that he married Lindsay Mills in a courthouse in Moscow.[7]\nSnowden has said that, in the 2008 presidential election, he voted for a third-party candidate, though he \"believed in Obama's promises.\" Following the election, he believed President Barack Obama was continuing policies espoused by George W. Bush.[35]\nIn accounts published in June 2013, interviewers noted that Snowden's laptop displayed stickers supporting Internet freedom organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Tor Project.[28] A week after publication of his leaks began, Ars Technica confirmed that Snowden had been an active participant at the site's online forum from 2001 through May 2012, discussing a variety of topics under the pseudonym \"TheTrueHOOHA.\"[36] In a January 2009 entry, TheTrueHOOHA exhibited strong support for the U.S. security state apparatus and said leakers of classified information \"should be shot in the balls.\"[37] However, Snowden disliked Obama's CIA director appointment of Leon Panetta, saying \"Obama just named a fucking politician to run the CIA.\"[38] Snowden was also offended by a possible ban on assault weapons, writing \"Me and all my lunatic, gun-toting NRA compatriots would be on the steps of Congress before the C-Span feed finished.\"[38] Snowden disliked Obama's economic policies, was against Social Security, and favored Ron Paul's call for a return to the gold standard.[38] In 2014, Snowden supported a basic income.[39]\nFeeling a duty to fight in the Iraq War to help free oppressed people,[28] Snowden enlisted in the United States Army Reserve on May 7, 2004, and became a Special Forces candidate through its 18X enlistment option.[40] He did not complete the training[13] because he broke both legs in a training accident,[41] and was discharged on September 28, 2004.[42]\nSnowden was then employed for less than a year in 2005 as a security guard at the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Study of Language, a research center sponsored by the National Security Agency (NSA).[43] According to the University, this is not a classified facility,[44] though it is heavily guarded.[45] In June 2014, Snowden told Wired that his job as a security guard required a high-level security clearance, for which he passed a polygraph exam and underwent a stringent background check.[24]\nAfter attending a 2006 job-fair focused on intelligence agencies, Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA.[24][46] The Agency assigned him to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.[24]\nIn May 2006, Snowden wrote in Ars Technica that he had no trouble getting work because he was a \"computer wizard\".[34] After distinguishing himself as a junior employee on the top computer team, Snowden was sent to the CIA's secret school for technology specialists, where he lived in a hotel for six months while studying and training full-time.[24]\nIn March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security.[24][47] Assigned to the U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations, a diplomatic mission representing U.S. interests before the UN and other international organizations, Snowden received a diplomatic passport and a four-bedroom apartment near Lake Geneva.[24] According to Greenwald, while there Snowden was \"considered the top technical and cybersecurity expert\" in that country and \"was hand-picked by the CIA to support the president at the 2008 NATO summit in Romania\".[48] Snowden described his CIA experience in Geneva as formative, stating that the CIA deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home. Snowden said that when the latter was arrested, a CIA operative offered to help in exchange for the banker becoming an informant.[49] Ueli Maurer, President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2013, in June of that year publicly disputed Snowden's claims. \"This would mean that the CIA successfully bribed the Geneva police and judiciary. With all due respect, I just can't imagine it,\" said Maurer.[50] In February 2009, Snowden resigned from the CIA.[51]\nIn 2009, Snowden began work as a contractee for Dell,[52] which manages computer systems for multiple government agencies. Assigned to an NSA facility at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo, Snowden instructed top officials and military officers on how to defend their networks from Chinese hackers.[24] Snowden looked into Mass surveillance in China prompted him to investigate and then expose Washington's mass surveillance programme after he was asked in 2009 to brief a conference in Tokyo.[53] During his four years with Dell, he rose from supervising NSA computer system upgrades to working as what his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 termed a \"cyberstrategist\" and an \"expert in cyber counterintelligence\" at several U.S. locations.[54] In 2011, he returned to Maryland, where he spent a year as lead technologist on Dell's CIA account. In that capacity, he was consulted by the chiefs of the CIA's technical branches, including the agency's chief information officer and its chief technology officer.[24] U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the investigation said Snowden began downloading documents describing the government's electronic spying programs while working for Dell in April 2012.[52] Investigators estimated that of the 50,000 to 200,000 documents Snowden gave to Greenwald and Poitras, most were copied by Snowden while working at Dell.[1]\nIn March 2012, Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead technologist for the NSA's information-sharing office.[24] At the time of his departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15 months inside the NSA's Hawaii regional operations center, which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea,[1] the last three of which were with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.[55] While intelligence officials have described his position there as a system administrator, Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst, which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world.[56] On March 15, 2013\u00a0\u2013 three days after what he later called his \"breaking point\" of \"seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress\"[57]\u00a0\u2013 Snowden quit his job at Dell.[58] Although he has said his career high annual salary was $200,000,[59] Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at Booz Allen,[59] where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity.[60] An anonymous source told Reuters that, while in Hawaii, Snowden may have persuaded 20\u201325 co-workers to give him their login credentials by telling them he needed them to do his job.[61] The NSA sent a memo to Congress saying that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal public key infrastructure certificate to gain greater access to the NSA's computer system.[62][63] Snowden disputed the memo,[64] saying in January 2014, \"I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers.\"[65][66] Booz Allen terminated Snowden's employment on June 10, 2013, one month after he had left the country.[67]\nA former NSA co-worker said that although the NSA was full of smart people, Snowden was a \"genius among geniuses\" who created a widely implemented backup system for the NSA and often pointed out security flaws to the agency. The former colleague said Snowden was given full administrator privileges with virtually unlimited access to NSA data. Snowden was offered a position on the NSA's elite team of hackers, Tailored Access Operations, but turned it down to join Booz Allen.[64] An anonymous source later said that Booz Allen's hiring screeners found possible discrepancies in Snowden's resume but still decided to hire him.[29] Snowden's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stated that he attended computer-related classes at Johns Hopkins University. A spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins said that the university did not find records to show that Snowden attended the university, and suggested that he may instead have attended Advanced Career Technologies, a private for-profit organization that operated as the Computer Career Institute at Johns Hopkins University.[29] The University of Maryland University College acknowledged that Snowden had attended a summer session at a UM campus in Asia. Snowden's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stated that he estimated that he would receive a University of Liverpool computer security master's degree in 2013. The university said that Snowden registered for an online master's degree program in computer security in 2011 but was inactive as a student and had not completed the program.[29]\nSnowden has said that he had told multiple employees and two supervisors about his concerns, but the NSA disputes his claim.[68] Snowden elaborated in January 2014, saying \"[I] made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co-workers, supervisors, and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen. The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled, but no one was willing to risk their jobs, families, and possibly even freedom to go through what [Thomas Andrews] Drake did.\"[66][69] In March 2014, during testimony to the European Parliament, Snowden wrote that before revealing classified information he had reported \"clearly problematic programs\" to ten officials, who he said did nothing in response.[70] In a May 2014 interview, Snowden told NBC News that after bringing his concerns about the legality of the NSA spying programs to officials, he was told to stay silent on the matter. He asserted that the NSA had copies of emails he sent to their Office of General Counsel, oversight and compliance personnel broaching \"concerns about the NSA's interpretations of its legal authorities. I had raised these complaints not just officially in writing through email, but to my supervisors, to my colleagues, in more than one office.\"[17]\nIn May 2014, U.S. officials released a single email that Snowden had written in April 2013 inquiring about legal authorities but said that they had found no other evidence that Snowden had expressed his concerns to someone in an oversight position.[71] In June 2014, the NSA said it had not been able to find any records of Snowden raising internal complaints about the agency's operations.[72] That same month, Snowden explained that he himself has not produced the communiqu\u00e9s in question because of the ongoing nature of the dispute, disclosing for the first time that \"I am working with the NSA in regard to these records and we're going back and forth, so I don't want to reveal everything that will come out.\"[73]\nIn his May 2014 interview with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government of trying to use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a \"low level analyst.\" In his words, he was \"trained as a spy in the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas\u2014pretending to work in a job that I'm not\u2014and even being assigned a name that was not mine.\" He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure \"in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading.\"[17] In a June interview with Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he \"was actually functioning at a very senior level.\"[74] In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, \"I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don\u2019t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting.\"[75] Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, \"I would sit down with the CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job to come up with a way to fix them.\"[24]\n\nOf his time as an NSA analyst, directing the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment when he and his colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly \"thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense\u2014for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people.\" As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the \"fringe benefits\" of the work.[76]\nThe exact size of Snowden's disclosure is unknown,[77] but Australian officials have estimated 15,000 or more Australian intelligence files[78] and British officials estimate at least 58,000 British intelligence files.[79] NSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 NSA documents.[80] Later estimates provided by U.S. officials were on the order of 1.7 million,[81] a number that originally came from Department of Defense talking points.[82] In July 2014, The Washington Post reported on a cache previously provided by Snowden from domestic NSA operations consisting of \"roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long, and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts.\"[83] A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report declassified in June 2015 said that Snowden took 900,000 Department of Defense files, more than he downloaded from the NSA.[82]\nIn March 2014, Army General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee, \"The vast majority of the documents that Snowden ... exfiltrated from our highest levels of security ... had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities. The vast majority of those were related to our military capabilities, operations, tactics, techniques and procedures.\"[84] When asked in a May 2014 interview to quantify the number of documents Snowden stole, retired NSA director Keith Alexander said there was no accurate way of counting what he took, but Snowden may have downloaded more than a million documents.[85]\nAccording to Snowden, he did not indiscriminately turn over documents to journalists, stating that \"I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest. There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over\"[28] and that \"I have to screen everything before releasing it to journalists ... If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country.\"[60] Despite these measures, the improper redaction of a document by the New York Times resulted in the exposure of intelligence activity against al-Qaeda.[86]\nIn June 2014, the NSA's recently installed director, U.S. Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done was not significant enough to conclude that \"the sky is falling.\"[87] Nevertheless, in February 2015, Rogers said that Snowden's disclosures had a material impact on the NSA's detection and evaluation of terrorist activities worldwide.[88]\nOn June 14, 2015, UK's Sunday Times reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence services had decrypted more than 1 million classified files in the Snowden cache, forcing the UK's MI6 intelligence agency to move agents out of live operations in hostile countries. Sir David Omand, a former director of the UK's GCHQ intelligence gathering agency, described it as a huge strategic setback that was harming Britain, America, and their NATO allies. The Sunday Times said it was not clear whether Russia and China stole Snowden's data or whether Snowden voluntarily handed it over to remain at liberty in Hong Kong and Moscow.[89][90] In April 2015 the Henry Jackson Society, a British neoconservative think tank, published a report claiming that Snowden's intelligence leaks negatively impacted Britain's ability to fight terrorism and organized crime.[91] Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International, criticized the report for, in his opinion, presuming that the public became concerned about privacy only after Snowden's disclosures.[92]\nSnowden's decision to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March 2007 posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station.[93] Snowden first made contact with Glenn Greenwald, a journalist working at The Guardian, on December 1, 2012.[94][95] He contacted Greenwald anonymously as \"Cincinnatus\"[96] and said he had sensitive documents that he would like to share.[97] Greenwald found the measures that the source asked him to take to secure their communications, such as encrypting email, too annoying to employ. Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras in January 2013.[98] According to Poitras, Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her New York Times article about NSA whistleblower William Binney.[99] What originally attracted Snowden to both Greenwald and Poitras was a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras's controversial films had made her a target of the government.[97]\nGreenwald began working with Snowden in either February[100] or April 2013, after Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New York City, at which point Snowden began providing documents to them.[94] Barton Gellman, writing for The Washington Post, says his first direct contact was on May 16, 2013.[101] According to Gellman, Snowden approached Greenwald after the Post declined to guarantee publication within 72 hours of all 41 PowerPoint slides that Snowden had leaked exposing the PRISM electronic data mining program, and to publish online an encrypted code allowing Snowden to later prove that he was the source.[101]\nSnowden communicated using encrypted email,[98] and going by the codename \"Verax\". He asked not to be quoted at length for fear of identification by stylometry.[101]\nAccording to Gellman, prior to their first meeting in person, Snowden wrote, \"I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions, and that the return of this information to the public marks my end.\"[101] Snowden also told Gellman that until the articles were published, the journalists working with him would also be at mortal risk from the United States Intelligence Community \"if they think you are the single point of failure that could stop this disclosure and make them the sole owner of this information.\"[101]\nIn May 2013, Snowden was permitted temporary leave from his position at the NSA in Hawaii, on the pretext of receiving treatment for his epilepsy.[28] In mid-May, Snowden gave an electronic interview to Poitras and Jacob Appelbaum which was published weeks later by Der Spiegel.[102]\nAfter disclosing the copied documents, Snowden promised that nothing would stop subsequent disclosures. In June 2013, he said, \"All I can say right now is the US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped.\"[103]\nOn May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong,[104] where he was staying when the initial articles based on the leaked documents were published,[105] beginning with The Guardian on June 5.[106] Greenwald later said Snowden disclosed 9,000 to 10,000 documents.[107]\nWithin months, documents had been obtained and published by media outlets worldwide, most notably The Guardian (Britain), Der Spiegel (Germany), The Washington Post and The New York Times (U.S.), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), and similar outlets in Sweden, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Australia.[108] In 2014, NBC broke its first story based on the leaked documents.[109] In February 2014, for reporting based on Snowden's leaks, journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman and The Guardian\u2032s Ewen MacAskill were honored as co-recipients of the 2013 George Polk Award, which they dedicated to Snowden.[110] The NSA reporting by these journalists also earned The Guardian and The Washington Post the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service[111] for exposing the \"widespread surveillance\" and for helping to spark a \"huge public debate about the extent of the government's spying\". The Guardian's chief editor, Alan Rusbridger, credited Snowden for having performed a public service.[112]\nThe ongoing publication of leaked documents has revealed previously unknown details of a global surveillance apparatus run by the United States' NSA[115] in close cooperation with three of its four Five Eyes partners: Australia's ASD,[116] the UK's GCHQ,[117] and Canada's CSEC.[118]\nOn June 5, 2013, media reports documenting the existence and functions of classified surveillance programs and their scope began and continued throughout the entire year. The first program to be revealed was PRISM, which allows for court-approved direct access to Americans' Google and Yahoo accounts, reported from both The Washington Post and The Guardian published one hour apart.[113][119][120] Barton Gellman of The Washington Post was the first journalist to report on Snowden's documents. He said the U.S. government urged him not to specify by name which companies were involved, but Gellman decided that to name them \"would make it real to Americans.\"[121] Reports also revealed details of Tempora, a British black-ops surveillance program run by the NSA's British partner, GCHQ.[119][122] The initial reports included details about NSA call database, Boundless Informant, and of a secret court order requiring Verizon to hand the NSA millions of Americans' phone records daily,[123] the surveillance of French citizens' phone and Internet records, and those of \"high-profile individuals from the world of business or politics.\"[124][125][126] XKeyscore, an analytical tool that allows for collection of \"almost anything done on the internet,\" was described by The Guardian as a program that shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements: \"I, sitting at my desk [could] wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email.\"[127]\nThe NSA's top-secret black budget, obtained from Snowden by The Washington Post, exposed the successes and failures of the 16 spy agencies comprising the U.S. intelligence community,[128] and revealed that the NSA was paying U.S. private tech companies for clandestine access to their communications networks.[129] The agencies were allotted $52 billion for the 2013 fiscal year.[130]\nIt was revealed that the NSA was harvesting millions of email and instant messaging contact lists,[131] searching email content,[132] tracking and mapping the location of cell phones,[133] undermining attempts at encryption via Bullrun[134][135] and that the agency was using cookies to piggyback on the same tools used by Internet advertisers \"to pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster surveillance.\"[136] The NSA was shown to be secretly accessing Yahoo and Google data centers to collect information from hundreds of millions of account holders worldwide by tapping undersea cables using the MUSCULAR surveillance program.[113][114]\nThe NSA, the CIA and GCHQ spied on users of Second Life, Xbox Live and World of Warcraft, and attempted to recruit would-be informants from the sites, according to documents revealed in December 2013.[137][138] Leaked documents showed NSA agents also spied on their own \"love interests,\" a practice NSA employees termed LOVEINT.[139][140] The NSA was shown to be tracking the online sexual activity of people they termed \"radicalizers\" in order to discredit them.[141] Following the revelation of Black Pearl, a program targeting private networks, the NSA was accused of extending beyond its primary mission of national security. The agency's intelligence-gathering operations had targeted, among others, oil giant Petrobras, Brazil's largest company.[142] The NSA and the GCHQ were also shown to be surveilling charities including UNICEF and M\u00e9decins du Monde, as well as allies such as European Commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[143]\nIn October 2013, Glenn Greenwald said \"the most shocking and significant stories are the ones we are still working on, and have yet to publish.\"[144] In November, The Guardian's editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger said that only one percent of the documents had been published.[145] In December, Australia's Minister for Defence David Johnston said his government assumed the worst was yet to come.[146]\nBy October 2013, Snowden's disclosures had created tensions[147][148] between the U.S. and some of its close allies after they revealed that the U.S. had spied on Brazil, France, Mexico,[149] Britain,[150] China,[151] Germany,[152] and Spain,[153] as well as 35 world leaders,[154] most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said \"spying among friends\" was unacceptable[155][156] and compared the NSA with the Stasi.[157] Leaked documents published by Der Spiegel in 2014 appeared to show that the NSA had targeted 122 high-ranking leaders.[158]\nAn NSA mission statement titled \"SIGINT Strategy 2012-2016\" affirmed that the NSA had plans for continued expansion of surveillance activities. Their stated goal was to \"dramatically increase mastery of the global network\" and to acquire adversaries' data from \"anyone, anytime, anywhere.\"[159] Leaked slides revealed in Greenwald's book No Place to Hide, released in May 2014, showed that the NSA's stated objective was to \"Collect it All,\" \"Process it All,\" \"Exploit it All,\" \"Partner it All,\" \"Sniff it All\" and \"Know it All.\"[160]\nSnowden said in a January 2014 interview with German television that the NSA does not limit its data collection to national security issues, accusing the agency of conducting industrial espionage. Using the example of German company Siemens, he said, \"If there's information at Siemens that's beneficial to US national interests\u2014even if it doesn't have anything to do with national security\u2014then they'll take that information nevertheless.\"[161] In the wake of Snowden's revelations and in response to an inquiry from the Left Party, Germany's domestic security agency Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (BfV) investigated and found no concrete evidence that the U.S. conducted economic or industrial espionage in Germany.[162]\nIn February 2014, during testimony to the European Union, Snowden said of the remaining undisclosed programs, \"I will leave the public interest determinations as to which of these may be safely disclosed to responsible journalists in coordination with government stakeholders.\"[163]\nIn March 2014, documents disclosed by Glenn Greenwald writing for The Intercept showed the NSA, in cooperation with the GCHQ, has plans to infect millions of computers with malware using a program called TURBINE.[164] Revelations included information about QUANTUMHAND, a program through which the NSA set up a fake Facebook server to intercept connections.[164]\nAccording to a report in The Washington Post in July 2014, relying on information furnished by Snowden, 90% of those placed under surveillance in the U.S. are ordinary Americans, and are not the intended targets. The newspaper said it had examined documents including emails, message texts, and online accounts, that support the claim.[165]\nIn an August 2014 interview, Snowden for the first time disclosed a cyberwarfare program in the works, codenamed MonsterMind, that would automate detection of a foreign cyberattack as it began and automatically fire back. \"These attacks can be spoofed,\" said Snowden. \"You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?\"[24]\nSnowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.[1] After the disclosures, his identity was made public by The Guardian at his request on June 9, 2013.[100] \"I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,\" he said. \"My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.\"[104]\nSnowden said he wanted to \"embolden others to step forward\" by demonstrating that \"they can win.\"[101] He also said that the system for reporting problems did not work. \"You have to report wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.\" He cited a lack of whistleblower protection for government contractors, the use of the Espionage Act of 1917 to prosecute leakers, and his belief that had he used internal mechanisms to \"sound the alarm,\" his revelations \"would have been buried forever.\"[93][166]\nIn December 2013, upon learning that a U.S. federal judge had ruled the collection of U.S. phone metadata conducted by the NSA as likely unconstitutional, Snowden said, \"I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts ... today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights.\"[167]\nIn January 2014, Snowden said his \"breaking point\" was \"seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress.\"[57] This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013\u2014three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald,[94] and nine months after the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads during the summer of 2012[1]\u2014in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans.[168] Snowden said, \"There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs.\"[169] In March 2014, Snowden said he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing.[70]\nIn May 2013, Snowden took a leave of absence, telling his supervisors he was returning to the mainland for epilepsy treatment, but instead left Hawaii for Hong Kong[170] where he arrived on May 20. Snowden told Guardian reporters in June that he had been in his room at the Mira Hotel since his arrival in the city, rarely going out. On June 10, correspondent Ewen MacAskill said Snowden had left his hotel only briefly three times since May 20.[171]\nSnowden vowed to challenge any extradition attempt by the U.S. government, and engaged a Hong Kong-based Canadian human rights lawyer Robert Tibbo as a legal adviser.[1][172][173] Snowden told the South China Morning Post that he planned to remain in Hong Kong for as long as its government would permit.[174][175] Snowden also told the Post that \"the United States government has committed a tremendous number of crimes against Hong Kong [and] the PRC as well,\"[176] going on to identify Chinese Internet Protocol addresses that the NSA monitored and stating that the NSA collected text-message data for Hong Kong residents. Glenn Greenwald said Snowden was motivated by a need to \"ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.\"[177]\nAfter leaving the Mira Hotel, Snowden was housed for two weeks in a number of apartments by other refugees seeking asylum in Hong Kong, an arrangement set up by Tibbo to hide from the US authorities.[178][179]\nThe Russian newspaper Kommersant nevertheless reported that Snowden was living at the Russian consulate shortly before his departure from Hong Kong to Moscow.[180] Ben Wizner, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and legal adviser to Snowden, said in January 2014, \"Every news organization in the world has been trying to confirm that story. They haven't been able to, because it's false.\"[181] Likewise rejecting the Kommersant story was Anatoly Kucherena, who became Snowden's lawyer in July 2013 when Snowden asked him for help in seeking temporary asylum in Russia.[182] Kucherena said Snowden did not communicate with Russian diplomats while he was in Hong Kong.[183][184] In early September 2013, however, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that, a few days before boarding a plane to Moscow, Snowden met in Hong Kong with Russian diplomatic representatives.[185]\nOn June 22, 18 days after publication of Snowden's NSA documents began, officials revoked his U.S. passport.[186] On June 23, Snowden boarded the commercial Aeroflot flight SU213 to Moscow, accompanied by Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks.[187][188] Hong Kong authorities said that Snowden had not been detained for the U.S. because the request had not fully complied with Hong Kong law,[189][190] and there was no legal basis to prevent Snowden from leaving.[191][192][Notes 1] On June 24, a U.S. State Department spokesman rejected the explanation of technical noncompliance, accusing the Hong Kong government of deliberately releasing a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant and after having sufficient time to prohibit his travel.[195] That same day, Julian Assange said that WikiLeaks had paid for Snowden's lodging in Hong Kong and his flight out.[196]\nIn October 2013, Snowden said that before flying to Moscow, he gave all the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, and kept no copies for himself.[93] In January 2014, he told a German TV interviewer that he gave all of his information to American journalists reporting on American issues.[57] During his first American TV interview, in May 2014, Snowden said he had protected himself from Russian leverage by destroying the material he had been holding before landing in Moscow.[17]\nIn January 2019, Vanessa Rodel, one of the refugees who had housed Snowden in Hong Kong, and her 7-year-old daughter were granted asylum by Canada. Five other people who helped Snowden still remain in Hong Kong awaiting a response to their asylum request.[197]\nOn June 23, 2013, Snowden landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.[198] WikiLeaks said he was on a circuitous but safe route to asylum in Ecuador.[199] Snowden had a seat reserved to continue to Cuba[200] but did not board that onward flight, saying in a January 2014 interview that he intended to transit through Russia but was stopped en route. He asserted \"a planeload of reporters documented the seat I was supposed to be in\" when he was ticketed for Havana, but the U.S. cancelled his passport.[181] He said the U.S. wanted him to stay in Moscow so \"they could say, 'He's a Russian spy.'\"[74] Greenwald's account differed on the point of Snowden being already ticketed. According to Greenwald, Snowden's passport was valid when he departed Hong Kong but was revoked during the hours he was in transit to Moscow, preventing him from obtaining a ticket to leave Russia. Greenwald said Snowden was thus forced to stay in Moscow and seek asylum.[201]\nAccording to one Russian report, Snowden planned to fly from Moscow through Havana to Latin America; however, Cuba told Moscow it would not allow the Aeroflot plane carrying Snowden to land.[183] Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that Cuba had a change of heart after receiving pressure from U.S. officials,[202] leaving him stuck in the transit zone because at the last minute Havana told officials in Moscow not to allow him on the flight.[203] The Washington Post contrasted this version with what it called \"widespread speculation\" that Russia never intended to let Snowden proceed.[204] Fidel Castro called claims that Cuba would have blocked Snowden's entry a \"lie\" and a \"libel.\"[200] Describing Snowden's arrival in Moscow as a surprise and likening it to \"an unwanted Christmas gift,\"[205] Russian president Putin said that Snowden remained in the transit area of Sheremetyevo Airport, had committed no crime in Russia, was free to leave and should do so.[206] Putin denied that Russia's intelligence agencies had worked or were working with Snowden.[205]\nFollowing Snowden's arrival in Moscow, the White House expressed disappointment in Hong Kong's decision to allow him to leave.[207][208][195] An anonymous U.S. official not authorized to discuss the matter told AP Snowden's passport had been revoked before he left Hong Kong, but that a senior official in a country or airline could order subordinates to overlook the withdrawn passport.[209] U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that Snowden's passport was cancelled \"within two hours\" of the charges against Snowden being made public[3] which was Friday, June 21.[2] In a July 1 statement, Snowden said, \"Although I am convicted of nothing, [the U.S. government] has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.\"[210]\nFour countries offered Snowden permanent asylum: Ecuador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Venezuela.[211] No direct flights between Moscow and Venezuela, Bolivia or Nicaragua existed, however, and the U.S. pressured countries along his route to hand him over. Snowden said in July 2013 that he decided to bid for asylum in Russia because he felt there was no safe way to reach Latin America.[212] Snowden said he remained in Russia because \"when we were talking about possibilities for asylum in Latin America, the United States forced down the Bolivian President's plane\", citing the Morales plane incident. On the issue, he said \"some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law, and this behavior persists today. This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights.\"[213] He said that he would travel from Russia if there was no interference from the U.S. government.[181]\nFour months after Snowden received asylum in Russia, Julian Assange commented, \"While Venezuela and Ecuador could protect him in the short term, over the long term there could be a change in government. In Russia, he's safe, he's well-regarded, and that is not likely to change. That was my advice to Snowden, that he would be physically safest in Russia.\"[170] According to Snowden, \"the CIA has a very powerful presence [in Latin America] and the governments and the security services there are relatively much less capable than, say, Russia.... they could have basically snatched me....\"[214]\nIn an October 2014 interview with The Nation magazine, Snowden reiterated that he had originally intended to travel to Latin America: \"A lot of people are still unaware that I never intended to end up in Russia.\" According to Snowden, the U.S. government \"waited until I departed Hong Kong to cancel my passport in order to trap me in Russia.\" Snowden added, \"If they really wanted to capture me, they would've allowed me to travel to Latin America, because the CIA can operate with impunity down there. They did not want that; they chose to keep me in Russia.\"[215]\nOn July 1, 2013, president Evo Morales of Bolivia, who had been attending a conference in Russia, suggested during an interview with Russia Today that he would consider a request by Snowden for asylum.[216] The following day, Morales's plane, en route to Bolivia, was rerouted to Austria and landed there, after France, Spain, and Italy denied access to their airspace. While the plane was parked in Vienna, the Spanish ambassador to Austria arrived with two embassy personnel and asked to search the plane but they were denied permission by Morales himself.[217] U.S. officials had raised suspicions that Snowden may have been on board.[218] Morales blamed the U.S. for putting pressure on European countries, and said that the grounding of his plane was a violation of international law.[219]\nIn April 2015, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, Mar\u00eda Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Julian Assange of inadvertently putting Morales's life at risk by intentionally providing to the U.S. false rumors that Snowden was on Morales's plane. Assange responded that \"we weren't expecting this outcome. The result was caused by the United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened.\"[220][221]\nSnowden applied for political asylum to 21 countries.[222][223] A statement attributed to him contended that the U.S. administration, and specifically Vice President Joe Biden, had pressured the governments to refuse his asylum petitions. Biden had telephoned President Rafael Correa days prior to Snowden's remarks, asking the Ecuadorian leader not to grant Snowden asylum.[224] Ecuador had initially offered Snowden a temporary travel document but later withdrew it,[225] and Correa later called the offer a mistake.[226]\nIn a July 1 statement published by WikiLeaks, Snowden accused the U.S. government of \"using citizenship as a weapon\" and using what he described as \"old, bad tools of political aggression.\" Citing Obama's promise to not allow \"wheeling and dealing\" over the case, Snowden commented, \"This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile.\"[227] Several days later, WikiLeaks announced that Snowden had applied for asylum in six additional countries, but declined to name them, alleging attempted U.S. interference.[228]\nAfter evaluating the law and Snowden's situation, the French interior ministry rejected his request for asylum.[229] Poland refused to process his application because it did not conform to legal procedure.[230] Brazil's Foreign Ministry said the government planned no response to Snowden's asylum request. Germany and India rejected Snowden's application outright, while Austria, Ecuador, Finland, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain said he must be on their territory to apply.[231][232][233] In November 2014, Germany announced that Snowden had not renewed his previously denied request and was not being considered for asylum.[234] Glenn Greenwald later reported that Sigmar Gabriel, Vice-Chancellor of Germany, told him the U.S. government had threatened to stop sharing intelligence if Germany offered Snowden asylum or arranged for his travel there.[235]\nPutin said on July 1, 2013, that if Snowden wanted to be granted asylum in Russia, he would be required to \"stop his work aimed at harming our American partners.\"[236] A spokesman for Putin subsequently said that Snowden had withdrawn his asylum application upon learning of the conditions.[237]\nIn a July 12 meeting at Sheremetyevo Airport with representatives of human rights organizations and lawyers, organized in part by the Russian government,[238] Snowden said he was accepting all offers of asylum that he had already received or would receive. He added that Venezuela's grant of asylum formalized his asylee status, removing any basis for state interference with his right to asylum.[239] He also said he would request asylum in Russia until he resolved his travel problems.[240]\nRussian Federal Migration Service officials confirmed on July 16 that Snowden had submitted an application for temporary asylum.[241] On July 24, Kucherena said his client wanted to find work in Russia, travel and create a life for himself, and had already begun learning Russian.[242]\nAmid media reports in early July 2013 attributed to U.S. administration sources that Obama's one-on-one meeting with Putin, ahead of a G20 meeting in St Petersburg scheduled for September, was in doubt due to Snowden's protracted sojourn in Russia,[243] top U.S. officials repeatedly made it clear to Moscow that Snowden should immediately be returned to the United States to face charges for the unauthorized leaking of classified information.[244][245][246] His Russian lawyer said Snowden needed asylum because he faced persecution by the U.S. government and feared \"that he could be subjected to torture and capital punishment.\"[247]\nIn a letter to Russian Minister of Justice Aleksandr Konovalov dated July 23, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder repudiated Snowden's claim to refugee status, and offered a limited validity passport good for direct return to the U.S.[248] He further asserted that Snowden would not be subject to torture or the death penalty, and would receive trial in a civilian court with proper legal counsel.[249] The same day, the Russian president's spokesman reiterated that his government would not hand over Snowden, noting that Putin was not personally involved in the matter and that it was being handled through talks between the FBI and Russia's FSB.[250]\nOn June 14, 2013, United States federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Snowden, charging him with theft of government property and two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 through unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.[2][248] Each of the three charges carries a maximum possible prison term of ten years. The charge was initially secret and was unsealed a week later.\n\nSnowden was asked in a January 2014 interview about returning to the U.S. to face the charges in court, as Obama had suggested a few days prior. Snowden explained why he rejected the request: What he doesn't say are that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court to the public and convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. ... So it's, I would say, illustrative that the President would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial.[57][251] Snowden's legal representative, Jesselyn Radack, wrote that \"the Espionage Act effectively hinders a person from defending himself before a jury in an open court.\" She said that the \"arcane World War I law\" was never meant to prosecute whistleblowers, but rather spies who betrayed their trust by selling secrets to enemies for profit. Non-profit betrayals were not considered.[252]\nOn September 17, 2019, the United States filed a lawsuit against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA.[253] The complaint alleges that Snowden violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir Permanent Record. The complaint lists the publishers Macmillan and Holtzbrink as relief-defendants.[254]\nOn June 23, 2013, Snowden landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport aboard a commercial Aeroflot flight from Hong Kong.[255][187][256] On August 1, after 39 days in the transit section, he left the airport and was granted temporary asylum in Russia for one year.[257] A year later, his temporary asylum having expired, Snowden received a three-year residency permit allowing him to travel freely within Russia and to go abroad for up to three months. He was not granted permanent political asylum.[258] In January 2017, a spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry wrote on Facebook that Snowden's asylum, which was due to expire in 2017, was extended by \"a couple more years\".[259][260] Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said the extension was valid until 2020.[261]\nAs of October 2019, Snowden had been granted permanent residency in Russia, which is renewed every three years. He secretly married Lindsay Mills in 2017. By 2019 he no longer felt the need to be disguised in public and lived what was described as a \"more or less normal life\", able to travel around Russia and make a living from speaking arrangements (locally and over the internet). His memoir Permanent Record was released internationally, and while U.S. royalties were expected to be seized, he was able to receive the advance.[6] According to Snowden, \"One of the things that is lost in all the problematic politics of the Russian government is the fact this is one of the most beautiful countries in the world\" with \"friendly\" and \"warm\" people.[6] In another interview, Snowden went on to say: \"There's a way to criticize the Russian government's policies without criticizing the Russian people who are  ordinary people, who just want to have a happy life; they just want to do better. They want the same things that you do.\"[262]\nA subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero,[263][264][265] a whistleblower,[266][267][268][269] a dissident,[270] a patriot,[271][272][273] and a traitor.[274][275][276][277] Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg called Snowden's release of NSA material the most significant leak in U.S. history.[278][279]\nNumerous high-ranking current or former U.S. government officials reacted publicly to Snowden's disclosures.\nIn the U.S., Snowden's actions precipitated an intense debate on privacy and warrantless domestic surveillance.[294][295] President Obama was initially dismissive of Snowden, saying \"I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.\"[296][297][298] In August 2013, Obama rejected the suggestion that Snowden was a patriot,[299] and in November said that \"the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it.\"[300]\nIn June 2013, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont shared a \"must read\" news story on his blog by Ron Fournier, stating \"Love him or hate him, we all owe Snowden our thanks for forcing upon the nation an important debate. But the debate shouldn't be about him. It should be about the gnawing questions his actions raised from the shadows.\"[301] In 2015, Sanders stated that \"Snowden played a very important role in educating the American public\" and that although Snowden should not go unpunished for breaking the law, \"that education should be taken into consideration before the sentencing.\"[302]\nSnowden said in December 2013 that he was \"inspired by the global debate\" ignited by the leaks and that NSA's \"culture of indiscriminate global espionage ... is collapsing.\"[303]\nAt the end of 2013, however, The Washington Post noted that the public debate and its offshoots had produced no meaningful change in policy, with the status quo continuing.[139]\nIn 2016, on The Axe Files podcast, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that Snowden \"performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made.\" Holder nevertheless said that Snowden's actions were inappropriate and illegal.[304]\nIn September 2016, the bipartisan U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence completed a review of the Snowden disclosures and said that the federal government would have to spend millions of dollars responding to the fallout from Snowden's disclosures.[305] The report also said that \"the public narrative popularized by Snowden and his allies is rife with falsehoods, exaggerations, and crucial omissions.\"[306] The report was denounced by Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman, who called it \"aggressively dishonest\" and \"contemptuous of fact.\"[307]\nIn August 2013, President Obama said that he had called for a review of U.S. surveillance activities before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations,[299] and announced that he was directing DNI James Clapper \"to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies.\"[308][309] In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using backdoors in hardware or software.[310] Panel member Geoffrey R. Stone said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks.[311]\nOn June 6, 2013, in the wake of Snowden's leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him. In Klayman v. Obama, Judge Richard J. Leon referred to the NSA's \"almost-Orwellian technology\" and ruled the bulk telephone metadata program to be probably unconstitutional.[312] Snowden later described Judge Leon's decision as vindication.[313]\nOn June 11, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, alleging that the NSA's phone records program was unconstitutional. In December 2013, ten days after Judge Leon's ruling, Judge William H. Pauley III came to the opposite conclusion. In ACLU v. Clapper, although acknowledging that privacy concerns are not trivial, Pauley found that the potential benefits of surveillance outweigh these considerations and ruled that the NSA's collection of phone data is legal.[314]\nGary Schmitt, former staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote that \"The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program\u2014a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff.\"[315]\nOn May 7, 2015, in the case of ACLU v. Clapper, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that Section 215 of the Patriot Act did not authorize the NSA to collect Americans' calling records in bulk, as exposed by Snowden in 2013. The decision voided U.S. District Judge William Pauley's December 2013 finding that the NSA program was lawful, and remanded the case to him for further review. The appeals court did not rule on the constitutionality of the bulk surveillance, and declined to enjoin the program, noting the pending expiration of relevant parts of the Patriot Act. Circuit Judge Gerard E. Lynch wrote that, given the national security interests at stake, it was prudent to give Congress an opportunity to debate and decide the matter.[316]\nOn June 2, 2015, the U.S. Senate passed, and President Obama signed, the USA Freedom Act which restored in modified form several provisions of the Patriot Act that had expired the day before, while for the first time imposing some limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication data on U.S. citizens by American intelligence agencies. The new restrictions were widely seen as stemming from Snowden's revelations.[317][318]\nHans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic security agency, speculated that Snowden could have been working for the Russian government.[319][320] Snowden rejected this insinuation,[321] speculating on Twitter in German that \"it cannot be proven if Maa\u00dfen is an agent of the SVR or FSB.\"[322]\nCrediting the Snowden leaks, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted Resolution 68/167 in December 2013. The non-binding resolution denounced unwarranted digital surveillance and included a symbolic declaration of the right of all individuals to online privacy.[323][324][325]\nSupport for Snowden came from Latin American leaders including the Argentinian President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, Bolivian President Evo Morales, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.[326][327]\nIn an official report published in October 2015, the United Nations special rapporteur for the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of speech, Professor David Kaye, criticized the U.S. government's harsh treatment of, and bringing criminal charges against, whistleblowers, including Edward Snowden. The report found that Snowden's revelations were important for people everywhere and made \"a deep and lasting impact on law, policy and politics.\"[328][329] The European Parliament invited Snowden to make a pre-recorded video appearance to aid their NSA investigation.[330][331] Snowden gave written testimony in which he said that he was seeking asylum in the EU, but that he was told by European Parliamentarians that the U.S. would not allow EU partners to make such an offer.[332] He told the Parliament that the NSA was working with the security agencies of EU states to \"get access to as much data of EU citizens as possible.\"[333] The NSA's Foreign Affairs Division, he claimed, lobbies the EU and other countries to change their laws, allowing for \"everyone in the country\" to be spied on legally.[334]\nIn July 2014, Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, told a news conference in Geneva that the U.S. should abandon its efforts to prosecute Snowden, since his leaks were in the public interest.[335]\nSurveys conducted by news outlets and professional polling organizations found that American public opinion was divided on Snowden's disclosures, and that those polled in Canada and Europe were more supportive of Snowden than respondents in the U.S. although more Americans have grown more supportive of Snowden's disclosure. In Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Spain more than 80% of people familiar with Snowden view him positively.[336]\nFor his global surveillance disclosures, Snowden has been honored by publications and organizations based in Europe and the United States. He was voted as The Guardian's person of the year 2013, garnering four times the number of votes as any other candidate.[337]\nIn March 2014, Snowden spoke at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive technology conference in Austin, Texas, in front of 3,500 attendees. He participated by teleconference carried over multiple routers running the Google Hangouts platform. On-stage moderators were Christopher Soghoian and Snowden's legal counsel Wizner, both from the ACLU.[338] Snowden said that the NSA was \"setting fire to the future of the internet,\" and that the SXSW audience was \"the firefighters.\"[339][340][341] Attendees could use Twitter to send questions to Snowden, who answered one by saying that information gathered by corporations was much less dangerous than that gathered by a government agency, because \"governments have the power to deprive you of your rights.\"[339] Representative Mike Pompeo (R-KS) of the House Intelligence Committee, and later director of the CIA, had tried unsuccessfully to get the SXSW management to cancel Snowden's appearance; instead, SXSW director Hugh Forrest said that the NSA was welcome to respond to Snowden at the 2015 conference.[339]\nLater that month, Snowden appeared by teleconference at the TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. Represented on stage by a robot with a video screen, video camera, microphones and speakers, Snowden conversed with TED curator Chris Anderson, and told the attendees that online businesses should act quickly to encrypt their websites. He described the NSA's PRISM program as the U.S. government using businesses to collect data for them, and that the NSA \"intentionally misleads corporate partners\" using, as an example, the Bullrun decryption program to create backdoor access.[342] Snowden said he would gladly return to the U.S. if given immunity from prosecution, but that he was more concerned about alerting the public about abuses of government authority.[342] Anderson invited Internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee on stage to converse with Snowden, who said that he would support Berners-Lee's concept of an \"internet Magna Carta\" to \"encode our values in the structure of the internet.\"[342][343]\nOn September 15, 2014, Snowden appeared via remote video link, along with Julian Assange, on Kim Dotcom's Moment of Truth town hall meeting held in Auckland.[344] He made a similar video link appearance on February 2, 2015, along with Greenwald, as the keynote speaker at the World Affairs Conference at Upper Canada College in Toronto.[345]\nIn March 2015, while speaking at the FIFDH (international human rights film festival) he made a public appeal for Switzerland to grant him asylum, saying he would like to return to live in Geneva, where he once worked undercover for the Central Intelligence Agency.[346]\nIn April 2015, John Oliver, the host of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, flew to Moscow to Interview Edward Snowden.[347]\nOn November 10, 2015, Snowden appeared at the Newseum, via remote video link, for PEN American Center's \"Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security and Free Expression,\" event.[348]\nIn 2015, Snowden earned over $200,000 from digital speaking engagements in the U.S.[349]\nOn March 19, 2016, Snowden delivered the opening keynote address of the LibrePlanet conference, a meeting of international free software activists and developers presented by the Free Software Foundation. The conference was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was the first such time Snowden spoke via teleconference using a full free software stack, end-to-end.[jargon][350][351][352][353]\nOn July 21, 2016, Snowden and hardware hacker Bunnie Huang, in a talk at MIT Media Lab's Forbidden Research event, published research for a smartphone case, the so-called Introspection Engine, that would monitor signals received and sent by that phone to provide an alert to the user if his or her phone is transmitting or receiving information when it shouldn't be (for example when it's turned off or in airplane mode), a feature described by Snowden to be useful for journalists or activists operating under hostile governments that would otherwise track their activities through their phones.[354][355][356][357][358]\nIn July 2013, media critic Jay Rosen defined The Snowden Effect as \"Direct and indirect gains in public knowledge from the cascade of events and further reporting that followed Edward Snowden's leaks of classified information about the surveillance state in the U.S.\"[359] In December 2013, The Nation wrote that Snowden had sparked an overdue debate about national security and individual privacy.[360] In Forbes, the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S. Congress in opposition to the massive post-9/11 domestic intelligence gathering system.[361] In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the Pew Research Center found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America.[362]\nOn November 2, 2018, Snowden provided a court declaration in Jewel v. National Security Agency.[363][364][365]\nSnowden's impact as a public figure has been felt in cinema,[368][369] advertising,[370] video games,[371][372] literature,[373][374] music,[375][376][377] statuary,[378][379] and social media.[380][381]\nSnowden gave Channel 4's \"Alternative Christmas Message\" in December 2013.[6]\nThe film Snowden, based on Snowden's leaking of classified US government material, was released in 2016.[382]\n</body></html>"
