A source is a fine-grained rock unit containing sufficient organic matter such that when it is heated and/or placed under pressure (maturation), hydrocarbons are generated. If the organic matter is of marine algal origin, then the source rock is most likely to generate oil under optimum maturation conditions, whereas rocks dominated by land-plant matter will tend to create gaseous hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons are of lower gravity than the surrounding groundwater and, therefore, move up and away (migration) from the source rock until they are trapped in a reservoir. A reservoir is a rock unit that acts as a storage device for the hydrocarbons that migrate from the source rock. Hydrocarbons are retained within the reservoir because these rocks contain numerous pores (essentially microscopic-sized holes) between the mineral grains making up the fabric of the reservoir. In good-quality reservoirs, the porosity is frequently over 20% of the rock volume. However, the pores need to be interlinked in such a manner that the fluids can move into (and out of, if humans are to exploit the oil and gas) the reservoirs over geologic time. This is known as permeability. There are two main rock types that make up the giant reservoirs around the world--sandstones made up of sand grains (quartz and feldspar in the majority) and carbonates made up of organically created calcium carbonate grains (corals, algae and shells) or mud. In order to stop the upward movement of hydrocarbons and constrain them to one zone of the subsurface (trap), there must be a barrier to prevent fluid migration. Generally this mechanism, or seal, consists of rocks that are impermeable to fluid flow. The most effective of these seals are mudstones or shales, very fine-grained rocks containing abundant clay minerals. Occasionally, the impermeable layers are dense igneous rocks and, in rare situations, there may be significant rock and fluid pressure differences in a region that prevents fluid flow and acts as a seal. Equally important is the presence of a trapping mechanism. This is either a structural form where the reservoir rock unit is contorted to produce a zone where fluids naturally accumulate against a seal, or where a reservoir rock unit changes laterally into an impermeable unit (reflecting changes in depositional environment along one bed). Upwarping of rocks, or anticlinal folds, are particularly good at trapping hydrocarbons, as are faults where permeable, titled reservoir strata are moved up against impermeable strata. Detection of hydrocarbons in the subsurface during exploration takes a number of forms: direct identification of hydrocarbons at the surface, direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI) in the subsurface, and indirect indicators both at the surface and in the subsurface. Traditionally, oil exploration was primarily conducted by recognizing seeps of hydrocarbons at the surface. Several thousand years ago, the Chinese used oil (mostly bitumen) obtained from seeps as medication, for waterproofing, and in warfare. The ancient Chinese frequently dug shallow pits or horizontal tunnels at the seep locations to recover the oil. In 1859, Colonel Edwin Drake drilled the first well to intentionally look for oil in the subsurface at Oil Creek, Pennsylvania. Again, detection was based on direct identification of seeped hydrocarbons at the surface. Initially, the oil was used to provide kerosene for lamps, but the later invention of the automobile drove up demand and ushered in modern methods of oil exploration. Around the turn the twentieth century and up until the 1950s, the main tool used for oil exploration was intensive and detailed geological mapping. This frequently occurred in terrain that was remote and inhospitable. The early pioneers--working their way through the jungles of Burma, the deserts of Iraq, or the mountains of Iran--would conduct detailed evaluations of the nature and distribution of rock units. These might represent potential reservoirs, seals, and source units, and might also reveal the frequency, orientation, and geologic history of folds or faults that could act as traps for the migrating hydrocarbons. If all four of the features required for oil or gas creation and trapping were recognized in a region, then a detailed local study might be undertaken to identify a suitable target (prospect). A shallow well might then be drilled to test the features. The concept of plate tectonics was one of the most important discoveries in petroleum studies. Not only did this revolutionize the earth sciences, but it also provided a conceptual setting for oil exploration. The movement of plates around the surface of Earth creates large-scale depressions into which substantial quantities of sediments (eroded from the surrounding high ground) may accumulate. These accumulations can exceed thicknesses of several thousand kilometers, and they are referred to as sedimentary basins. By comparing basins around the world and comparing them to existing hydrocarbon-producing regions, an exploration team can say which basins are worth looking at in more detail. Next, oil detectors would spend time ensuring that all the key elements that control the presence of hydrocarbons are present within the basin. Assuming that all the needed features are present, the team would agree that the basin contained a viable petroleum system, and prospecting could proceed. In modern exploration programs, mapping gravitational and magnetic anomalies would normally be the first method applied to a new basin or region being evaluated. These techniques would identify large-scale changes in the structure of the basement and sedimentary basins together with major differences in rock density, such as the influx of dense igneous rocks or light salt into a sedimentary sequence. These techniques are large scale, can be applied over both land and water, and can even be collected remotely from plane or satellite. At the same time, remote sensing of onshore areas--initially based on large-scale photogeologic surveys and, after the 1970s, by satellite imaging--can identify areas with the anticlinal and faulted structural features, seeps, or salt domes frequently associated with oil occurrences. Offshore remote sensing of the sea surface can lead to the identification of slicks associated with the seepage of oil (both natural and human-made) into the water column. A grid of seismic data is then collected to obtain a picture of the subsurface in the area to be targeted. Seismic data collection involves the generation of a seismic wave using an energy source such as an air-gun in water, dynamite in drill holes inland, or a truck with a plate that is thumped down onto the road/soil surface (vibroseis). The wave travels through Earth's rock layers and reflects back off key surfaces. The time it take for the waves to be received back at the surface, as well as information about their strength, is recorded via geophones and displayed on a seismic section. Processing the seismic sections using computer software reveals the detailed structure of the subsurface and in certain circumstances shows the presence of direct hydrocarbon indicators, such as bright spots associated with gas/water differences. Primarily, though, seismic studies are used to indicate the nature of folded and faulted structures that could prove to be suitable hydrocarbon traps. These are frequently referred to as leads. The objective of seismic acquisition and processing is to acoustically image the subsurface in a geologically accurate manner with as high resolution as possible. For a detailed analysis of a small area representing a field or prospect, high-density and calibrated three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data are collected. Modern technology also allows scientists to accurately map changes in fluid movements over time (repeat multiple 3-D seismic surveys, known as 4-D seismic), and this technique is now particularly important in monitoring production performance of the reservoir. Ultimately, however, the only way of confirming the presence or absence of hydrocarbons at depth is by drilling the prospect. In certain areas of the world where drilling is cheap and the subsurface has been explored extensively, such as certain onshore basins of the United States, drilling is commonly preferred to extensive and expensive seismic acquisition. Wells are then analyzed using electric, sonic, and radioactive logging techniques that measure characteristics of the rocks and fluids. These methods can identify the presence of oil and gas, which can then be tested to see if they occur at commercially viable production levels. On the other hand, at a cost of millions of dollars per offshore exploration well, oil companies are also likely first to employ the sophisticated battery of direct and indirect detection techniques before resorting to drilling in these areas. Australian researchers announced in 2005 that they had developed a new type of laser that could save millions of dollars in oil exploration. The new technique is called on-line laser micropyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, or LaPy-GC/MS. Despite its cumbersome name, the new apparatus is able to rapidly and accurately analyze small amounts of organic matter (such as organic particles, microfossils, solid bitumens, and oil-bearing inclusions) in source rocks and reservoir rocks. The accuracy and sensitivity of the instrument will allow oil companies to predict with greater confidence the oil-source potential of any subsurface being studied.

Folds commonly form during regional horizontal shortening in orogenic (mountain building) belts at microscopic to regional scales in all rock types. Many rocks are brittle and shatter easily at Earth's surface when rapidly deformed, but even these rocks may fold during the application of regional, tectonic stresses over a long period of time at depth. Such a change in rock rheology is due to elevated temperature and confining pressure, as well as the presence of fluids at deeper levels of the crust. Folds have their own terminology. Upright layers (where young beds overlie older beds) that are arched upward are called anticlines. If the direction of younging (facing) is not known, such folds are called antiforms. Layers that are bent downward are called synclines (where beds are upright) or synforms where facing is not known. Cylindrical folds show the same profile in sections normal to their axes at any position along the axis. Folds where profiles vary from section to section and layers describe part of a cone are called conical folds. Folds are also classified according to the orientation of their hinge line or fold axis (the axis of curvature) and of their axial surface (the surface that bisects fold limbs and passes through the fold axis). The angle the fold hinge makes with the horizontal is called the plunge of a fold. Folds plunge gently when this angle is 0°-30°, moderately between 30°-60°, steeply between 60°-90°, and are vertical when axes plunge 90°. Folds are upright where the axial surface is steeply dipping, inclined where the axial surface is moderately dipping, overturned where the axial surface is shallowly dipping and one limb is inverted, and recumbent where the axial surface is horizontal. In parallel folds, the layer thickness measured normal to the layer is constant around the fold. In similar folds, layer thicknesses measured parallel to the axial plane are constant. When describing folds, it is also important to note the inter-limb angle and whether fold hinges are rounded or angular. Strong (competent) layers interlayered with more ductile (incompetent) layers buckle during layer-parallel shortening. The wavelength of the resulting folds depends on both the layer thickness and the viscosity (competence) contrast between layers. Larger wavelength folds develop in thick or competent layers. Folds may also develop during ductile flow in high-grade metamorphic rocks and in incompetent, lower-grade rocks. Irregular and often highly contorted syn-sedimentary folds can form during deposition of sedimentary rocks within slumps (which may be triggered by earthquakes). When rocks that have already been folded are subjected to further shortening, early-formed folds may be refolded. Different fold interference patterns develop depending on the relative orientations of axes and axial surfaces for both generations of folds. A \"dome and basin\" (also called \"egg carton\") pattern results from the interference between two sets of upright folds whose axial surfaces are at a large angle to each other. A mushroom-shaped interference pattern results where folds with horizontal or shallowly dipping axial surfaces are folded by upright folds. A \"hook\" interference pattern occurs where fold axes are of similar orientation, but where axial surfaces are at a high angle to each other. Folds may also form during regional crustal extension, such as in sedimentary basins. Roll-over antiforms develop over curved extensional (normal) faults in the upper, brittle crust or ductile shear zones in the middle to lower crust. Synforms are formed above areas where the underlying fault or ductile shear zone changes from shallowly to steeply dipping. Folds may also form during back-rotation of layers between two extensional faults or ductile shear zones. In high-grade rocks, folds may also form in surrounding layers when a competent layer pinches and swells or separates into barrel-shaped fragments (boudins) during layer-parallel extension. Folds control the formation and localization of some petroleum and mineral deposits. Many oil and gas traps are created by regional-scale antiforms or domes formed by fold superposition, in wrench zones, or on the margins of salt diapirs. Some gold deposits are also controlled by folds. Differences in fold style of adjacent beds may lead to parting of beds along fold hinges. Quartz-- and, if chemical conditions are favorable, gold--may be deposited from fluids that migrate to such dilatational sites forming saddle reefs. In higher-grade rocks, rare metal pegmatites may intrude dilatational sites along fold hinges. Folds also provide geologists with valuable information about the orientation of stresses in Earth's crust at the time of their formation, helping them to unravel regional geological history.",

He became infatuated with rock and roll and rhythm and blues during his teens. He wrote his own songs and performed with bands like the Shades during the 1950s; he also frightened his parents with his behavior. According to Victor Bockris's 1996 biography Reed attended Syracuse University and later worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, gulping amphetamines and trumping up and recording tracks like the minor dance sensation \"The Ostrich.\" Yet even as he penned these no-brainers, he was absorbing the most lurid works of literature, including the writings of the notorious Marquis de Sade and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the namesakes of sadism and masochism, respectively. Reed's dark romanticism was profoundly influenced by a unique combination of highbrow underground writings such as these and the yearning teenaged plaint of early rock and roll--not to mention his own painful experiences. This feverish sensibility drove the Velvet Underground, the band Reed helped form in the early 1960s with multi-instrumentalist and musical avant-gardist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Moe Tucker.

The Velvet Underground disbanded in 1970, and Reed went home to his parents' house in Long Island.

         "text" : "no title\n\nThe Southern California alternative rock group Lit set fire to the modern rock scene in early 1999; The members of Lit, brothers A. Jay Popoff, lead vocalist and songwriter and Jeremy Popoff, guitarist and songwriter; Kevin Baldes, bass guitarist; and drummer, Allen Shellenberger, met while students at the same Anaheim, California, high school. Brought up on large doses of Metallica and Iron Maiden, the foursome started out as a heavy metal band called Razzle--later renamed Stain--and found a loyal following in nearby Los Angeles, selling out shows at famous clubs like the Whiskey, Troubadour, and the Roxy. Around 1990, the foursome officially became Lit and transformed their musical image. Previously a solid rock and roll band, Lit now introduced alternative rock into their music and claimed singers such as Frank Sinatra, in addition to the Foo Fighters and Metallica, as inspirations. \"I'd say that the way we like to live is more the Rat Pack [led by Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin] way of life than the Motley Crüe way of life,\" Jeremy Popoff told David Derby in an interview for Rolling Stone.com. However, Lit refused to follow the trend of other Orange County-based modern rock groups to revive ska and swing. Instead, the foursome adhered to a blend of rock-driven punk/pop music. \"We've just always been a straight rock band,\" A.J. Popoff mused to Derby, \"and I guess that's not always the cool thing to be.\" In addition to not fitting into the Southern California scene as well as other bands, Lit also had to compensate for a lack of venues in Orange County. \"What's cool is that there's so many kinds of bands from Orange County: Social Distortion, the Offspring, Korn, No Doubt,\" commented A. Jay Popoff to Launch.com's David Weiss, describing the area surrounding Lit's hometown. \"A lot of bands that have been around for the last nine or 10 years are surfacing now. It seems like there's a huge Orange County scene, but there's not really a lot of clubs to play. There's not a huge nightlife.\" Consequently, the group focused on their live shows in order to draw in fans and frequently sold out dates at a Fullerton, California, night spot called Club 369. In 1996, after finally signing with the independent label Malicious Vinyl, the band released an EP entitled As Lit's popularity spread throughout Southern California, major label RCA Records offered the band a record deal. Subsequently, Lit signed with RCA in late 1998. The band entered the recording studio and returned in February of 1999 with their second album, \"My Own Worst Enemy,\" a power-pop tune that discussed morning-after regrets, became a modern rock radio anthem. About the song, A. Jay Popoff told Midnight Jones for Launch.com, \"It isn't based on any one of our particular personal experiences. It's just a jumble of times where someone went out and had too much to drink. You say things you shouldn't say and do things you shouldn't do and then the next day you realize how bad you f**ked up. A lot of people comment on the lyrics, but the hooky guitar riff doesn't hurt either.\" Although the Popoff brothers write the foundation for the group's songs, the whole band participates in arranging music and picking tracks for albums. Thus, Lit developed \"My Own Worst Enemy\" with the same approach they use for all of their songs. \"Our jam sessions go through the `Lit machine' and everyone puts in their two cents,\" A. Jay explained. \"Within two minutes, we know if it's going to be a song. If everyone's not into it right away, we get rid of it. We're not one of those bands that writes 30 songs for a 12-song album.\" Despite Lit's mainstream success, the group continued to give concerts top priority. \"Having a song on the radio is something we've always dreamed of, but we're a total live band so validation to us is packing clubs, meeting the kids, and seeing how music affects them,\" A. Jay Popoff asserted, as quoted by Jones. \"We are all about the whole showbiz thing. We like bands who are flashy, not ones where it's like you are watching a bunch of roadies on stage.\" Holding true to their word and upholding their flashy, Las Vegas-style attitude, Lit spent most of 1999 on tour, opening for groups such as Silverchair and Eve 6 and joining the Vans Warped Tour. Considering the group's favorite recreational activities--collecting vintage Cadillacs, traveling to Las Vegas, playing poker, admiring the Rat Pack--it comes as no surprise that Lit never wanted to be a typical rock band. \"Our sound is of today, but our vibe is classic,\" A. Jay Popoff told Jones. These interests came into play for video for \"My Own Worst Enemy.\" Shot in a Las Vegas bowling alley by director Gavin Bowden (who also directed videos for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Aeroplane\" and Matchbox 20's \"3 a.m.\"), the video aptly projected the intended Lit image. \"It's [the film]",

We're not one of those bands that writes 30 songs for a 12-song album.\" Despite Lit's mainstream success, the group continued to give concerts top priority. \"Having a song on the radio is something we've always dreamed of, but we're a total live band so validation to us is packing clubs, meeting the kids, and seeing how music affects them,\" A. Jay Popoff asserted, as quoted by Jones. \"We are all about the whole showbiz thing. We like bands who are flashy, not ones where it's like you are watching a bunch of roadies on stage.\" Holding true to their word and upholding their flashy, Las Vegas-style attitude, Lit spent most of 1999 on tour, opening for groups such as Silverchair and Eve 6 and joining the Vans Warped Tour. Considering the group's favorite recreational activities--collecting vintage Cadillacs, traveling to Las Vegas, playing poker, admiring the Rat Pack--it comes as no surprise that Lit never wanted to be a typical rock band. \"Our sound is of today, but our vibe is classic,\" A. Jay Popoff told Jones. These interests came into play for video for \"My Own Worst Enemy.\" Shot in a Las Vegas bowling alley by director Gavin Bowden (who also directed videos for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Aeroplane\" and Matchbox 20's \"3 a.m.\"), the video aptly projected the intended Lit image. \"It's [the film]</body></html>",

Once dismissed as a mere pop entertainer, Dion has earned the respect of critics for his musicianship, street-savvy lyrics, and his ability to sustain an audience well into his senior years.

He hardly seemed a candidate for show business stardom, but he had two valuable assets that he learned to use: a beautiful singing voice and a cool, macho image that somehow suited rock 'n' roll music. \"The day I heard Hank Williams for the first time, my life changed,\" Dion told Dougherty. \"Before that, music was boring. ... Rock and roll didn't exist in my neighborhood before that.

The group had a number of Top 40 hits between 1957 and 1960, including \"No One Knows,\" \"Don't Pity Me,\" \"A Teenager in Love,\" and \"A Lover's Prayer.\" Their most fateful appearance was certainly February 2, 1959, when they appeared in Clear Lake, Iowa, on a program with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper. At the show's conclusion, Dion was asked to pitch in thirty-five dollars to charter a plane to the next concert site. He chose to travel in the bus instead, and thus was spared when the plane carrying Holly and Valens crashed in a cornfield, killing all aboard.

Some critics felt that Dion's work in the 1970s was hampered by lack of vision on the part of his producers. As Marsh puts it, the singer was \"trapped in the company's pop-rock production mill,\" with shoddy backup and lackluster promotion burying his albums.

Seals brought the musical traditions of Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Howlin' Wolf to a new generation of blues guitarists and fans, at a time when the music seemed to be dying out. An energetic performer, Seals took his hard electric blues on the road, revitalizing traditional Delta blues and introducing rock-influenced blues to a broad new audience. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Seals wrote most of his own material. Between 1973 and 1996 he recorded eight albums for Chicago's Alligator Records. Born on August 14, 1942, in Osceola, Arkansas, the youngest of 13 children, Frank Seals was raised with the blues. His mother played the piano and sang. His father, Jim Seals, was a blues musician who had played piano, guitar, trombone, and drums with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels, a vaudeville and tent-show band in which both Ma Rainey and her protégé Bessie Smith had begun their careers. Frank Seals was nicknamed \"Little Son\" after his father, who then became \"Ol' Man Son.\" Son Seals was quoted on the The Seals family lived behind Jim Seals's famous nightclub, the Dipsy Doodle, which featured blues up front and dice in the back room. There, in the sleepy town of Osceola, blues legends such as Sonny Boy Williamson and Albert King hung out and performed. King, a native of Osceola, became Son Seals's mentor. By the age of 13, Seals was playing drums with Williamson, Robert Nighthawk, and Earl Hooker. In addition to the blues, Seals loved the big band music of Count Basie and the swing bands out of Memphis, Tennessee. In an October 2001 interview with Charles Chapman, published on the Seals formed his first band, Son Seals and the Upsetters, in 1959, playing throughout Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi.

         "text" : "no title\n\nAn icon of the Chicago blues, Son Seals was known for his intense and innovative guitar playing and his grainy singing. Seals brought the musical traditions of Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Howlin' Wolf to a new generation of blues guitarists and fans, at a time when the music seemed to be dying out. An energetic performer, Seals took his hard electric blues on the road, revitalizing traditional Delta blues and introducing rock-influenced blues to a broad new audience. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Seals wrote most of his own material. Between 1973 and 1996 he recorded eight albums for Chicago's Alligator Records. Born on August 14, 1942, in Osceola, Arkansas, the youngest of 13 children, Frank Seals was raised with the blues. His mother played the piano and sang. His father, Jim Seals, was a blues musician who had played piano, guitar, trombone, and drums with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels, a vaudeville and tent-show band in which both Ma Rainey and her protégé Bessie Smith had begun their careers. Frank Seals was nicknamed \"Little Son\" after his father, who then became \"Ol' Man Son.\" Son Seals was quoted on the The Seals family lived behind Jim Seals's famous nightclub, the Dipsy Doodle, which featured blues up front and dice in the back room. There, in the sleepy town of Osceola, blues legends such as Sonny Boy Williamson and Albert King hung out and performed. King, a native of Osceola, became Son Seals's mentor. By the age of 13, Seals was playing drums with Williamson, Robert Nighthawk, and Earl Hooker. In addition to the blues, Seals loved the big band music of Count Basie and the swing bands out of Memphis, Tennessee. In an October 2001 interview with Charles Chapman, published on the Seals formed his first band, Son Seals and the Upsetters, in 1959, playing throughout Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi.

In the years since her string of hit records during the 1970s, she formed a family vocal group, called Walela, whose music reflects the soul of their Native American ancestry. Coolidge and her two sisters, Priscilla and Linda, were blessed with powerful singing voices. \"I was singing close harmony with my sisters in church when I was two,\" she told J. Poet of Attending high school in Nashville, Coolidge was a member of the same debate team as country/pop hitmaker Brenda Lee. When she was 15 years old, the family moved to Florida. While attending Florida State University, she formed a folk group called R.C. and the Moonpies and played gigs at frat parties to help finance her education. Far more lucrative was her work at Pepper Sound, a jingle studio in Memphis, where she recorded radio station IDs and commercial ditties. The studio honchos liked what they heard and gave her a shot at a recording her first record, \"Turn Around and Love You.\" The song was popular regionally, but only scaled the bottom of the national charts. Coolidge moved to Los Angeles shortly thereafter. Her brother-in-law, Booker T. of Booker T. &amp; the MG's, introduced Rita to Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett. She quickly made her mark singing backup vocals for such rock luminaries as Leon Russell, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, and Duane Allman on the duo's most popular album Through Delaney and Bonnie, Coolidge met Joe Cocker, who hired her to sing backup during his infamous Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour with Leon Russell. Unorganized, unrehearsed, and intense, the show was the hottest ticket in rock music at the time, and each night Coolidge sang a powerhouse version of the Carpenters' \"Superstar.\" The tour, which reportedly inspired Russell to write \"Delta Lady\" in her honor, earned Coolidge a recording contract with A&amp;M Records. Coolidge married singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson, one of Nashville's most promising stars, in 1973. She'd sung backup on Kristofferson's gospel hit \"Why Me Lord,\" a country crossover smash that earned Kristofferson plaudits as the new Hank Williams. When Kristofferson and Coolidge began recording together, however, critics claimed she was riding his coattails. Kristofferson inadvertently did much to validate that impression by insisting that his wife be included in the movie projects and television appearances he was offered. According to Lee Hale's book Coolidge didn't have a big hit under her own name until she covered Jackie Wilson's 1967 classic \"(Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher And Higher\" on her 1977 album With Kristofferson in demand for movie roles and Coolidge's recording career heating up, the couple drifted apart. They divorced in 1980, a breakup reflected in Coolidge's poignant hit for that year, \"I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love.\" Her final chart smash, \"All Time High,\" was the theme to the 1983 James Bond film After her contract with A&amp;M expired in 1984, Coolidge recorded for various independent labels; Critique, Permanent, 404 Music, and Varese Sarabande were among them. She dabbled in musical theater, took small singing roles in films, and even returned to session work, singing behind rock veterans Eric Clapton and Jimmy Buffet. She didn't really make an impact again, though, until she teamed with sister Priscilla and her daughter Laura Satterfield to sing Coolidge's \"Cherokee Morning Song\" for Robbie Robertson's 1994 Capitol LP</body></html>",

         "text" : "no title\n\nThe incisive guitar lines of Steve Cropper helped define the contours of soul and funk in the 1960s, when he worked unflaggingly as the house guitarist--and often as composer, arranger, producer, and engineer--for Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee. As part of the instrumental quartet Booker T. & the MG's, Cropper not only wrote material for and backed up some of the most famous names in soul but also helped popularize the minimalist funk style that would later engulf rhythm and blues. Cropper worked as a solo artist and journeyman session player and producer during the 1970s before joining the Blues Brothers group, which introduced Memphis soul to a new generation of listeners. When Booker T. & the MG's regrouped in the early 1990s, they found themselves hipper than ever: they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and toured as rock survivor Neil Young's backup group. By this time, as Walt Hetfield of Guitar Player wrote, Cropper was widely acknowledged to be \"the most imitated guitarist of the soul genre.\" Cropper was born in Willow Springs, Missouri, in 1941. His family moved to Memphis when he was still a child, and Cropper began playing guitar in his teens; his primary influences were blues players and such early rock and rollers as Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. While still in high school, Cropper and his friend Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, who played bass, formed a band called the Mar-Keys. Cropper was just 20 years old when the Mar-Keys' single, an instrumental called \"Last Night,\" surged up the charts. The following year, Cropper was hired by Stax to play in the house band. At a 1962 session backing up rocker Billy Lee Riley, Cropper ended up playing on an instrumental jam composed by keyboardist Booker T. Jones. The result so enthralled Stax head Jim Stewart--who happened to be engineering the session-- that Stewart decided to release \"Behave Yourself\" as a single on his label's subsidiary Volt. Jones had another little idea for the B-side: a slice of Hammond organ-driven funky blues called \"Green Onions.\" Mixing the sensual, murky proto-rock of Howlin' Wolf with the ultracool jazz grooves of organists like Jimmy Smith and \"Big John\" Patton, the song became one of the most enduring instrumental tracks of its time. Cropper, Jones, drummer Al Jackson, Jr., and bassist Lewis Steinberger, all of whom had been playing with the Mark-Keys, became the first incarnation of Booker T. & the MG's--\"MG\" standing for \"Memphis Group\"--and Stax had a monster hit single on its hands, even if it was originally supposed to be the B-side. The song sold over a million copies, reached the top of the R&B charts, cruised to the Number Three position on the pop charts, and supported an album of the same name, which reached the Top 40. Other singles, including \"Chinese Checkers\" and \"Mo' Onions,\" followed to less success. Steinberger was fired in 1964 and was replaced by Dunn, who subsequently anchored the MG's rhythm section. Cropper and company spent the next few years accompanying soul artists like Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and many others, establishing the Stax sound as one of the most influential in all of pop. In fact, the generation of rock musicians in the United States and England who came of age in this period frequently cite Stax and its Detroit competitor Motown as titanic influences. But whereas Motown's silky, refined artists helped make black music more acceptable to white audiences, the Memphis sound refused to hone its rough edges and was thus arguably more important to the development of both the funk and the rock that followed. Much of the credit for the Memphis sound goes to Cropper, who not only lent a raw urgency and honest emotionalism to his playing but helped nurse many of the classic Stax recordings from inception to mixdown. \"I spent all my time--15 hours a day, on average--in the studio,\" Cropper recalled to Hetfield of Guitar Player. \"My wife hated it, my kids hated it, and my friends hated it. I would go to bed at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, get an hour or two of sleep, be on the golf course at 6:30 or 7:00, and be in the studio by 10:30 or 11:00. I would work until midnight or after, go to bed, and do it again.\" Indeed, as Cropper testified in a Rolling Stone interview, the classic Sam and Dave single \"Soul Man\"--though credited on the label to Isaac Hayes and David Porter--bore the imprint of Cropper's style before it had lyrics. Cropper's description of the song's evolution evokes the spontaneous, loose, creative environment at Stax: \"Well, when it first started Ike [Hayes] just had some changes on the piano and then it built into that [song]. I worked with him a while and came up with a guitar line; he worked with Duck a while and came up with a bass line. David and Isaac put words to it, Al put the drum beat to it. The horns were worked up on the session. Sam and Dave were taught the song as soon as they got into the session.\" Cropper had similar collaborations with Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett. \"Otis did more to change my sound than anybody,\" Cropper told Hetfield of Guitar Player. \"He made me think and play a lot simpler, so that different notes would really count dramatically.\" Cropper co-wrote Redding's monster hit \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay.\" Pickett, a New York sensation in need of a national hit, came to Memphis \"with [Atlantic Records executive and soul music visionary] Jerry Wexler. It was kind of an experience for everybody really to work with somebody like [Wexler].\" Wexler picked up the story in his memoir Rhythm and the Blues: \"Instead of trying to provide material, I urged [Pickett]--with local genius Steve Cropper--to create his own. I put the two of them in a hotel room with a bottle of Jack Daniels and the simple exhortation- -`'Write!'--which they did.\" The result was \"The Midnight Hour,\" which was one of Pickett's greatest hits. As the 1960s progressed, Booker T. & the MG's scored several more hits, notably \"Hip Hug-Her,\" \"Soul Limbo,\" and versions of movie themes, including \"Hang 'Em High\" and The Graduate's \"Mrs. Robinson.\" The MG's backed Redding at the Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967, one of the most important such festivals of the decade. Yet the group showed signs of creative fatigue by 1970, when they released McLemore Avenue, an album featuring instrumental versions of all the songs on Abbey Road, the unofficial swan song of British pop revolutionaries the Beatles. Jones quit the group soon thereafter, and in 1971 Cropper left Stax to found his own label and studio, TMI, in Memphis. He worked as session guitarist and songwriter and acted as producer for a number of disparate artists, including the California funk collective Tower of Power, rockers Poco, folk singer-songwriter John Prine and guitar wizard Jeff Beck. Cropper also released a solo album that featured guest appearances from the MG's and a plethora of other talented players, among them Leon Russell and Buddy Miles. Later in the 1970s Cropper collaborated with a number of high- profile artists in Los Angeles. Sadly, original MG's drummer Jackson was murdered in 1975, but the surviving members reunited with various drummers; with Stax skinsman Willie Hall they recorded Universal Language in 1977, and nine years later they shared a stage for a couple of songs at the Memphis Music Festival. When comedians John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd developed the personae of the Blues Brothers and performed a mixture of Memphis soul and Chicago blues, they assembled a large band that included Cropper and Dunn. First appearing on television's Saturday Night Live, the popular sketch led first to an album, Briefcase Full of Blues, then to a movie--in which Cropper and Dunn played themselves--and later a tour and more records. The Blues Brothers version of \"Soul Man\" allowed Belushi to echo the vocal cue that preceded Cropper's guitar break on the original recording: \"Play it, Steve.\" Though Belushi died in 1982, Cropper collaborated with Ackroyd on several other Blues Brothers projects in the ensuing years. In his interview with Hetfield, the guitarist characterized the Blues Brothers' repopularization of the Stax sound as \"the greatest thing there ever was.\" Another MG's reunion was scheduled for Atlantic's 1988 40th Anniversary celebration at New York's Madison Square Garden, but Booker T. was too ill and Late Night keyboardist Paul Shaffer, who had helped Belushi and Ackroyd assemble the Blues Brothers band, stepped in. By 1990, despite periodic reunions, Cropper had become sufficiently obscure to warrant a \"what happened to\" query in Guitar Player. Cropper reported at the time that he was \"having fun getting out there and seeing the world\" on tour with other Blues Brothers alumni. In 1990 Cropper joined British rockers Dave Edmunds and Graham Parker and 1950s rock singer Dion, among others, in a touring \"Rock & Roll Revue.\" Parker expressed to Musician writer Scott Isler his hope that young audiences would appreciate the music bypassed by so-called \"classic-rock\" radio. \"If there is something classic it's Steve Cropper's guitar style,\" Parker insisted. Indeed, Isler reported, everyone on the tour \"is in awe of Steve Cropper.\" Cropper, who initially resisted going on the tour, recalled, \"I said, 'I don't know if I'm your guy. I'm not really a rock 'n' roll guitar player.'\" Once on the road, however, he felt grateful to the tour organizers \"for talking me into it, 'cause I was really trying to slip out of it.\" Cropper also did some writing with younger bluesman Robert Cray, who described Cropper to Guitar Player's Hetfield as \"a great working partner\" who \"has these great titles, great potential stories. He leaves you with that, and it just opens you up.\" In the early 1990s the MG's reassembled at the Montreaux Jazz Festival and at the Lone Star Roadhouse in New York. In 1991 a boxed set of Stax singles spanning nearly ten years and featuring not only the group's greatest hits but best-known performances by Pickett, Redding, Eddie Floyd, Rufus and Carla Thomas, and many others, won a Grammy Award. At a March 1992 Lone Star show, Shaffer's drummer, Anton Fig, filled in for Jackson. Rolling Stone's Steve Futterman observed, \"It was obvious that whatever bond united Jones, Cropper and Dunn in the Sixties still coursed through their veins and that Fig had received a transfusion.\" The show Futterman reviewed took place one day after the group's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \"One day we got a phone call saying, 'You guys are definitely going into the Hall of Fame.' We said, 'What?!' We had been nominated once or twice before and didn't get in, so we figured that we wouldn't get in again,\" Cropper told Hetfield. \"At that point things changed.\" The revitalized Booker T. & the MG's played at U.S. President Bill Clinton's 1993 inaugural ball and were the \"house band\" at the all-star tribute to trailblazing rock songwriter Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden. The group went on tour with Neil Young--with drummer Jim Keltner attempting to fill Al Jackson's shoes--and soon found themselves with a new record deal, this time with Columbia. The result was the 1994 album That's the Way It Should Be. Versatile sidemen Steve Jordan and James Gadson handled drum duties, and the group tackled such varied material as Irish rock group U2's \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" and the soul nugget \"I Can't Stand the Rain,\" as well as several originals. \"I wouldn't refer to [That's the Way It Should Be] as a comeback until we have a hit,\" Cropper said in an interview with Billboard's Carlo Wolff. \"I'd like to follow in the footsteps of [R&B and rock diva] Tina Turner. Wouldn't that be nice? A 30-year overnight success.\" A quote from the guitarist in a Columbia press release read, \"The biggest challenge was to sound like Booker T. & the MG's. It might seem easy but how do you sound like you sounded thirty years ago and still have it fresh, up to date and technically together? I'd lay a rhythm pattern and Booker would put a melody on top of the pattern and then Duck would come in and put an incredible bass on it. Somehow we did it. We believed in it and it happened.\" Whatever might happen with the MG's reunion, Cropper had already left an indelible mark on popular music. Long before the profusion of flamboyant, ultra-fast lead guitarists, Cropper had provided an example of economical, generous grooving that would stand the test of time. \"I can't play guitar if I'm not playing it from the heart,\" he insisted to Hetfield. The musician elaborated on his philosophy: \"The main idea is not what you play; it's what you don't play. The less you play, the more it means.\"",

As part of the instrumental quartet Booker T. &amp; the MG's, Cropper not only wrote material for and backed up some of the most famous names in soul but also helped popularize the minimalist funk style that would later engulf rhythm and blues. Cropper worked as a solo artist and journeyman session player and producer during the 1970s before joining the Blues Brothers group, which introduced Memphis soul to a new generation of listeners. When Booker T. &amp; the MG's regrouped in the early 1990s, they found themselves hipper than ever: they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and toured as rock survivor Neil Young's backup group. By this time, as Walt Hetfield of Guitar Player wrote, Cropper was widely acknowledged to be \"the most imitated guitarist of the soul genre.\" Cropper was born in Willow Springs, Missouri, in 1941. His family moved to Memphis when he was still a child, and Cropper began playing guitar in his teens; his primary influences were blues players and such early rock and rollers as Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. While still in high school, Cropper and his friend Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, who played bass, formed a band called the Mar-Keys. Cropper was just 20 years old when the Mar-Keys' single, an instrumental called \"Last Night,\" surged up the charts. The following year, Cropper was hired by Stax to play in the house band. At a 1962 session backing up rocker Billy Lee Riley, Cropper ended up playing on an instrumental jam composed by keyboardist Booker T. Jones. The result so enthralled Stax head Jim Stewart--who happened to be engineering the session-- that Stewart decided to release \"Behave Yourself\" as a single on his label's subsidiary Volt. Jones had another little idea for the B-side: a slice of Hammond organ-driven funky blues called \"Green Onions.\" Mixing the sensual, murky proto-rock of Howlin' Wolf with the ultracool jazz grooves of organists like Jimmy Smith and \"Big John\" Patton, the song became one of the most enduring instrumental tracks of its time. Cropper, Jones, drummer Al Jackson, Jr., and bassist Lewis Steinberger, all of whom had been playing with the Mark-Keys, became the first incarnation of Booker T. &amp; the MG's--\"MG\" standing for \"Memphis Group\"--and Stax had a monster hit single on its hands, even if it was originally supposed to be the B-side. The song sold over a million copies, reached the top of the R&amp;B charts, cruised to the Number Three position on the pop charts, and supported an album of the same name, which reached the Top 40. Other singles, including \"Chinese Checkers\" and \"Mo' Onions,\" followed to less success. Steinberger was fired in 1964 and was replaced by Dunn, who subsequently anchored the MG's rhythm section. Cropper and company spent the next few years accompanying soul artists like Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and many others, establishing the Stax sound as one of the most influential in all of pop. In fact, the generation of rock musicians in the United States and England who came of age in this period frequently cite Stax and its Detroit competitor Motown as titanic influences. But whereas Motown's silky, refined artists helped make black music more acceptable to white audiences, the Memphis sound refused to hone its rough edges and was thus arguably more important to the development of both the funk and the rock that followed. Much of the credit for the Memphis sound goes to Cropper, who not only lent a raw urgency and honest emotionalism to his playing but helped nurse many of the classic Stax recordings from inception to mixdown. \"I spent all my time--15 hours a day, on average--in the studio,\" Cropper recalled to Hetfield of Guitar Player. \"My wife hated it, my kids hated it, and my friends hated it. I would go to bed at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, get an hour or two of sleep, be on the golf course at 6:30 or 7:00, and be in the studio by 10:30 or 11:00. I would work until midnight or after, go to bed, and do it again.\" Indeed, as Cropper testified in a Rolling Stone interview, the classic Sam and Dave single \"Soul Man\"--though credited on the label to Isaac Hayes and David Porter--bore the imprint of Cropper's style before it had lyrics. Cropper's description of the song's evolution evokes the spontaneous, loose, creative environment at Stax: \"Well, when it first started Ike [Hayes] just had some changes on the piano and then it built into that [song]. I worked with him a while and came up with a guitar line; he worked with Duck a while and came up with a bass line. David and Isaac put words to it, Al put the drum beat to it. The horns were worked up on the session. Sam and Dave were taught the song as soon as they got into the session.\" Cropper had similar collaborations with Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett. \"Otis did more to change my sound than anybody,\" Cropper told Hetfield of Guitar Player. \"He made me think and play a lot simpler, so that different notes would really count dramatically.\" Cropper co-wrote Redding's monster hit \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay.\" Pickett, a New York sensation in need of a national hit, came to Memphis \"with [Atlantic Records executive and soul music visionary] Jerry Wexler. It was kind of an experience for everybody really to work with somebody like [Wexler].\" Wexler picked up the story in his memoir Rhythm and the Blues: \"Instead of trying to provide material, I urged [Pickett]--with local genius Steve Cropper--to create his own. I put the two of them in a hotel room with a bottle of Jack Daniels and the simple exhortation- -`'Write!'--which they did.\" The result was \"The Midnight Hour,\" which was one of Pickett's greatest hits. As the 1960s progressed, Booker T. &amp; the MG's scored several more hits, notably \"Hip Hug-Her,\" \"Soul Limbo,\" and versions of movie themes, including \"Hang 'Em High\" and The Graduate's \"Mrs. Robinson.\" The MG's backed Redding at the Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967, one of the most important such festivals of the decade. Yet the group showed signs of creative fatigue by 1970, when they released McLemore Avenue, an album featuring instrumental versions of all the songs on Abbey Road, the unofficial swan song of British pop revolutionaries the Beatles. Jones quit the group soon thereafter, and in 1971 Cropper left Stax to found his own label and studio, TMI, in Memphis. He worked as session guitarist and songwriter and acted as producer for a number of disparate artists, including the California funk collective Tower of Power, rockers Poco, folk singer-songwriter John Prine and guitar wizard Jeff Beck. Cropper also released a solo album that featured guest appearances from the MG's and a plethora of other talented players, among them Leon Russell and Buddy Miles. Later in the 1970s Cropper collaborated with a number of high- profile artists in Los Angeles. Sadly, original MG's drummer Jackson was murdered in 1975, but the surviving members reunited with various drummers; with Stax skinsman Willie Hall they recorded Universal Language in 1977, and nine years later they shared a stage for a couple of songs at the Memphis Music Festival. When comedians John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd developed the personae of the Blues Brothers and performed a mixture of Memphis soul and Chicago blues, they assembled a large band that included Cropper and Dunn.

His father, son of a pioneer who had migrated from Tennessee to Arkansas in 1825, served in the Confederate Army, then became a successful banker and cotton broker in Little Rock and was three times a candidate for governor. Fletcher's mother was of Danish and German ancestry; from her he acquired a love of music, poetry, and art. When Fletcher was three, his father purchased the stately antebellum mansion that had been the home of Albert Pike, an early Arkansas scholar and poet. Confined to its grounds without playmates, the sensitive boy began to develop a romantic point of view that was to color his entire life and work. He received his early education from tutors and in a private local academy and graduated from the Little Rock high school in 1902. After a year in Phillips Academy at Andover, Mass., he was admitted to Harvard in the fall of 1903. Predisposed toward the arts, and taking only a perfunctory interest in his other studies, Fletcher spent many hours in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He had been reared as an Episcopalian, but when a Nietzschean friend convinced him that he could no longer accept organized religion, he turned to poetry as a substitute. He wrote his first poems in the summer of 1905 while on a trip to the West Coast. During his junior year he discovered the English poet Arthur Symons, and through Symons the French symbolists. His father's death in 1906 brought promise of financial independence, and Fletcher gave up college in the middle of his senior year. For a time he pursued an interest in archaeology, but a field trip in the Southwest disenchanted him, and in the summer of 1908 he sailed for Europe. After a sojourn in Italy, he settled in London and threw himself into the Socialist movement. At the urging of a Fabian friend he began to read Whitman and to write poetry in a somewhat Whitmanesque vein. In 1913, after publishing five small volumes of poetry at his own expense, Fletcher made his first important literary friendship: he met Ezra Pound, who introduced him to various London literary figures, among them the Imagist poets \"H.D.\" (Hilda Doolittle) and Richard Aldington. At first unsympathetic to the aims of the Imagists, Fletcher refused Pound's invitation to contribute to his anthology After the outbreak of war in 1914, Fletcher made the first of several returns to the United States. He remained there for over a year, living chiefly in Boston, the friend and neighbor of Conrad Aiken. In Chicago he met Harriet Monroe, who had published his work in her magazine Fletcher spent seven months in America in 1926 and realized that thenceforward his future lay in his native land. On a lecture tour through the South he spoke at Nashville, where he met John Crowe Ransom and Donald Davidson of the Fugitive group. A meeting with Allen Tate led to an invitation to contribute to the symposium Although Fletcher is remembered chiefly as an Imagist, he departed from that relatively narrow movement fairly early in his career and was always somewhat of a loner. In his early work he was an experimenter who sought to fuse the influences of Postimpressionist art and music in free verse. He went his own way in drawing upon oriental philosophy and imagery to express his personal mysticism. His style and themes changed notably in America, and though his Southern regional poetry, like the rest of his poetry, is uneven in quality, some feel that in it he achieved his greatest artistic success.

         "text" : "no title\n\nPerhaps the quintessential heavy metal band, Iron Maiden has sold more than forty-five million records worldwide, remaining the object of a faithful international fan base since the early 1980s. Numerous hit singles and platinum albums have also attested to the consistence of the listening habits of metal fans long after the much-maligned genre had ceased to make headlines in the music press. Ditching the more bluesy grooves of hard rock bands from the 1970s such as Deep Purple and UFO, Iron Maiden came up with a faster, riff-laden, yet melodious song structure which set the standards for what most listeners came to understand to be heavy metal. A marked preference for lyrics grounded on horror, mythology, wars, and history became another of the genre's key reference points, not to mention Gargantuan onstage production values and globe-trotting concert tours. Iron Maiden was formed in London in 1976 by bassist Steve Harris. At the height of the so-called \"punk revolution\" spearheaded by Sex Pistols and The Clash, Harris persisted with heavy metal through constant lineup changes and difficulties in finding performing venues. By the time both punk and disco were on the decline, however, Harris had managed to recruit more reliable group members, including singer Paul Di'Anno and lead guitarist Dave Murray. After playing the club circuit, the band began to generate some minor attention in the press, and produced an independent three song record in 1979. The single pressing of three thousand copies sold out so quickly that EMI offered them an album deal. The early 1980s marked what the British press dubbed the \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\": Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Saxon, and other bands began to storm into the domestic charts and soon enjoyed international success. Heralded by the hit single \"Running Free,\" from Former Samson singer Bruce Dickinson joined the band in 1981. The energetic and charismatic frontman became an immediate favorite with fans and indelibly embodied Iron Maiden's mainstream success in the 1980s. An accomplished songwriter with powerful, semi-operatic vocal skills and manic stage antics, Dickinson is also one of rock's most imitated singers. The album After five consecutive platinum albums in the United States, Iron Maiden saw local musical tastes shift toward the more commercial sounds and glamorized looks of groups like Bon Jovi and Cinderella. The band's popularity dwindled in North America during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but its international following remained strong, as evidenced by two headline appearances at the annual \"Monsters of Rock\" festival in Donington, England, in 1989 and 1992 in front of one-hundred-thousand-plus crowds. In 1993, Dickinson announced his departure after eleven successful years, leaving for a more low-profile solo career. The search for his replacement began through an international contest sponsored by the band, resulting in thousands of tapes being sent in by would-be rock stars. Blaze Bayley, formerly with Wolfsbane, was ultimately announced as the new singer. With the retirement of Martin Birch, Harris himself was now at the helm producing the band's records and videos. Apart from Birch, another backstage personality who played a key role in the lasting success of Iron Maiden was manager Rod Smallwood, the man who, from the beginning, ran the band's financial and commercial arm, Sanctuary Music. In the late 1990s, Sanctuary was also managing a number of other bands--whose records were sometimes produced by Harris--and even entered London's stock market in an ambitious (and successful) move. Maiden also proved to be multimedia-savvy with the creation of a state-of-the-art video game featuring Eddie and by re-releasing all of its albums in enhanced CDs containing the band's music videos.",

Iron Maiden was formed in London in 1976 by bassist Steve Harris. At the height of the so-called \"punk revolution\" spearheaded by Sex Pistols and The Clash, Harris persisted with heavy metal through constant lineup changes and difficulties in finding performing venues. By the time both punk and disco were on the decline, however, Harris had managed to recruit more reliable group members, including singer Paul Di'Anno and lead guitarist Dave Murray. After playing the club circuit, the band began to generate some minor attention in the press, and produced an independent three song record in 1979. The single pressing of three thousand copies sold out so quickly that EMI offered them an album deal. The early 1980s marked what the British press dubbed the \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\": Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Saxon, and other bands began to storm into the domestic charts and soon enjoyed international success. Heralded by the hit single \"Running Free,\" from Former Samson singer Bruce Dickinson joined the band in 1981. The energetic and charismatic frontman became an immediate favorite with fans and indelibly embodied Iron Maiden's mainstream success in the 1980s. An accomplished songwriter with powerful, semi-operatic vocal skills and manic stage antics, Dickinson is also one of rock's most imitated singers. The album After five consecutive platinum albums in the United States, Iron Maiden saw local musical tastes shift toward the more commercial sounds and glamorized looks of groups like Bon Jovi and Cinderella. The band's popularity dwindled in North America during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but its international following remained strong, as evidenced by two headline appearances at the annual \"Monsters of Rock\" festival in Donington, England, in 1989 and 1992 in front of one-hundred-thousand-plus crowds. In 1993, Dickinson announced his departure after eleven successful years, leaving for a more low-profile solo career. The search for his replacement began through an international contest sponsored by the band, resulting in thousands of tapes being sent in by would-be rock stars. Blaze Bayley, formerly with Wolfsbane, was ultimately announced as the new singer. With the retirement of Martin Birch, Harris himself was now at the helm producing the band's records and videos. Apart from Birch, another backstage personality who played a key role in the lasting success of Iron Maiden was manager Rod Smallwood, the man who, from the beginning, ran the band's financial and commercial arm, Sanctuary Music. In the late 1990s, Sanctuary was also managing a number of other bands--whose records were sometimes produced by Harris--and even entered London's stock market in an ambitious (and successful) move. Maiden also proved to be multimedia-savvy with the creation of a state-of-the-art video game featuring Eddie and by re-releasing all of its albums in enhanced CDs containing the band's music videos.</body></html>",

Early life can be described as a world filled with excitement of new friends, the anticipation and exhilaration of recess, and the careful wariness of local bullies. Wozniak, the frontman for Marcy Playground--a modern rock band from New York City that made its big break with 1997's international hit \"Sex and Candy\"--acknowledged the activity among the swing sets, merry-go-rounds, and monkey bars as a beginning of life, and drew inspiration from that time for much of his work in the trio. The real, but warmer, emotions borrowed from a grade school playground in Midwest America were a change from the angst and disillusionment of the early 1990s grunge era. Marcy Playground rose from the careless, uninterested mood of early 1990s rock as something fresh. First of all, the group was formed on the East Coast instead of the Northwest or Southern California. They chose an approach that was more positive than the aggravation commonly found in rock &amp; roll bands, and represented a change of attitude from the 1990s grunge movement of Seattle. Brandon Barber of Marcy Playground formed in New York City's Lower East Side. Vocalist and guitarist Wozniak, bassist Dylan Keefe, and drummer Dan Reiser named their group after Marcy Open School, Wozniak's elementary school in Minneapolis. Keefe and Reiser had played together for about seven years before they joined with Wozniak and left college in Boston to pursue their musical aspirations. They had put much effort into several successful New York City singer/songwriters' projects. Honing their skills as professional musicians, the two were ready to put effort into a project of their own. Wozniak lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during the late 1970s, where he grew up in a liberal yet spiritual environment. He revealed on Marcy Playground's official Web site that he \"grew up in a house where African shamen, Indian medicine men, and Tibetan monks could frequently be found rifling through the cupboards for peanut butter on any given morning.\" Wozniak's early education was also \"alternative.\" He attended Marcy Open School, a progressive, experimental elementary school. Avoiding bullies that would gang up on him during recess, Wozniak stayed inside listening to music, watching the events on the playground down below. He developed his artistic nature during this time through creative expression of his fears and excitement as a child. Surprisingly, Keefe had attended the Minneapolis \"open\" school system at the same time as Wozniak, even though they did not meet until years afterward. Keefe had attended a sister school, the Lake Harriet Open Program, on the other side of town. For Keefe, the beginnings of Marcy Playground were filled with high emotion. He met Wozniak on the same day his father took his own life in 1996. Perhaps through his family, friends, and the new-found creative outlet, Keefe was able to move past his immediate loss and reach out to people suffering similar situations. Keefe and his brother John worked through their grief by openly sharing their experience with others. John used grant funds to start and maintain a Web site so suicide survivors could become part of a community as they struggled with their emotions. As a tribute to Keefe's creative and influential father, the band dedicated its first record to him. The trio released their eponymous debut album, Still, life was not easy. Marcy Playground traveled through turbulence when their recording label dissolved. Thanks to former EMI employees and a music director from San Diego, California's radio station 91X, the band survived a move to Capitol Records. Capitol picked up the group, re-released the album and even put out a video for the project's superhit \"Sex and Candy.\" Marcy Playground's debut album was commercially successful, selling more than two million copies. Another unique factor was the group's origin. New York was several thousand miles away from the trend in American music at that time.

The group paid its dues during the hair band era of the 1980s, but Metallica's self-titled 1991 release addressed the decidedly adult topics of nuclear holocaust, mental illness, suicide, and the dangers of drug addiction. Yet despite these grim themes, Metallica's music runs contrary to heavy metal's one-dimensional image; their sound involves more than just bone-breaking chords and fire-and-brimstone lyrics. The band has distinguished itself with a grungy sophistication well beyond the work of its predecessors to become one of the largest selling acts in the history of American music. Members of Metallica may be rude and cheeky, but they're proficient. Metallica coalesced in 1981 with singer-guitarist James Hetfield, drummer Lars Ulrich, bass player Cliff Burton, and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine, who had taken over for early collaborator Lloyd Grant, was replaced in 1983 by Kirk Hammett. Their first album, Tragedy struck Metallica on September 27, 1986, when the band's tour bus went into a ditch in Sweden, killing bassist Cliff Burton. After a brief hiatus, the band reassembled and began looking for a replacement for Burton, although duplicating his eccentric, unbridled style seemed an impossible task. Burton had never been a particularly smooth player, but other band members had not attempted to rein him in. Attempts to persuade him to forego his bell-bottom jeans in favor of more traditional heavy metal garb were futile; Burton was set in his ways and rarely influenced by others. To refurbish their lineup, the members of Metallica decided to settle on someone completely different from Burton, and tapped Jason Newsted, then with the Phoenix band Flotsam &amp; Jetsam. Newsted was raised in Niles, Michigan, and had decided to turn professional after playing in bands throughout high school. Burton had been a remarkable soloist, but Newsted provided Metallica with a more cohesive sound. Burton's sound had not been well-defined, particularly when he played low on the guitar's neck. Instead, Newsted chose to mirror the band's guitar riffs precisely, producing a newly unified guitar effect. This sound dominated the new band's 1988 double album, titled Still steely, but a little slicker, The band's head-banging thrash metal songs are short but not sweet; they're delivered with grim, tight expressions and a minimum of emotion, which gives the impression that the entire band is grimacing. Metallica's albums have few tender spots; songs range from the brutal \"Sad But True\" to the sweet and gritty \"Ride the Lightning,\" and from the praised pagan slant found on \"Of Wolf And Man\" to the metaphysical musings of \"Through the Never.\" Commenting on their larger musical style, Davis said of the band, \"They hew thrash to a rigorous minimalism.\" Worn from touring during the early 1990s and a contract suit against Elektra, Metallica's next release did not come until 1996. The album The late 1990s and early 2000s brought new challenges for the group, both inside the studio and out. The group toured in support of In January of 2001, Jason Newsted announced that he planned to leave Metallica after 14 years, \"due to private and personal reasons, and the physical damage that I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love. This is the most difficult decision of my life, made in the best interest of my family, myself, and the continued growth of Metallica,\" according to his comments on the Elektra Records Web site. The group decided not to rush into finding a replacement for Newsted, but took on producer Rob Rock to do all the bass parts; they then took some time off to rest and recover. In 2002 the members got together again to make a new album, In 2004 a documentary film about Metallica, Foege waxed mathematic in his assessment of Metallica, writing, \"At turns algebraically elegant and geometrically raucous, present-day Metallica can stop and start on a dime.\" With their popularity showing no signs of flagging, their musical and lyrical virtuosity on the upswing, and their fans more crazed than ever, Metallica is a speeding bullet surely headed for continued success. In 2009 Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. As part of their tour in 2010, the band performed with Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, three other heavy metal bands.

His grandfather, Gideon Daniel, founded G. D. Searle, Inc., in 1888. (It merged with Monsanto Company in 1985.) Searle worked for the family business during summer breaks from Howe (Indiana) Academy and New Trier Township (Illinois) High School. A champion swimmer, he enlisted (though he was underage) in the U.S. Naval Reserve forces during World War I and taught swimming; he graduated from high school in 1918, while he was serving in the reserves (1918–1919). After the war Searle attended the University of Michigan from 1920 to 1923, where he played quarterback for the football team. After graduating in 1923 with a B.S. in pharmacy, Searle worked as a buyer and later as an office manager for the family's firm. He married Frances Crow on 25 April 1925; they had three children. By 1931 Searle had become general manager and vice president of the family firm. He eliminated unprofitable products from the line during the Great Depression, and he reoriented the company's research efforts to develop unique products that could be marketed profitably worldwide. Among the new products were the laxative Metamucil; Aminophyllin, for treatment of respiratory disorders; and Dramamine, which was developed as an antihistamine but was discovered to be the most effective remedy for motion sickness. The company's fortune rested, however, on developing the first effective and inexpensive oral contraceptive for women. The social activist Margaret Sanger had pioneered family planning and birth control in America. In 1923 she opened the first family planning clinic in New York City. During the 1920s Sanger organized medical conferences concerning hormonal contraceptives, while fundamental research was sponsored by the philanthropist Mrs. Page McCormick. The principle of oral contraceptives, using artificially synthesized derivatives of natural steroid hormones, was understood theoretically in the 1920s. Estrogen and progesterone are natural steroid hormones. Estrogen makes possible the growth of the endometrium, a membrane that lines the womb. It is present in the early stage of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone produces a mucus substance in the lower lining of the womb and inhibits the passage of sperm. It is present in the late part of the menstrual cycle. In 1937 researchers noted that synthetic progesterone could inhibit ovulation during the early menstrual cycle in rabbits, but at $200 a gram the synthetic progesterone was very expensive. During the early 1950s it was discovered that progesterone could be simulated with synthetic steroids made from a wild Mexican yam. Margaret Sanger urged Mrs. McCormick to fund further research at the Rock Reproductive Clinic in Brookline, Massachusetts. There, John Rock had been studying the promotion of fertility. Meanwhile, the physicians M. C. Chang and Gregory Pincus, at the Worchester (Massachusetts) Foundation for Experimental Biology, were researching estrogen. Rock found that when hormones to induce fertility over months of treatment were stopped, a significant percentage of women became pregnant (\"the Rock rebound\"). Chang and Pincus discovered that progesterone was effective in inhibiting pregnancy. The three researchers then collaborated on experiments that combined dosages of estrogen and progesterone. In animal tests even a low dosage effectively controlled menstrual bleeding. Moreover, by starting the dosage five days after the menstrual period began and ending it on the twenty-fourth day, ovulation was effectively inhibited. In 1956 Rock's collaborator, Celso Ramon Garcia, conducted extensive clinical trials. Searle then developed a sequential dosage of estrogen, followed by a dosage of combined estrogen and progestrogen. The sequential dosage was first marketed in 1957 under the trade name Enovid, packaged in a round plastic tray so that the proper pill would be taken during each day of a menstrual cycle. In 1966 Searle marketed Ovulen, which reduced the dosage of estrogen while remaining equally effective. When the pills were discontinued, fertility returned rapidly. G. D. Searle, Inc., boosted its sales from $37 million in 1960 to almost $89 million in 1965. Almost half its business came from Enovid, which cost $2.50 retail per month. A prescription lasted six months, and doctors monitored women for any side effects. During the early 1960s minor side effects (weight gain, headaches, nausea) were noted in a tiny percentage of users. By the mid-1960s there were many press reports of rare major side effects (among them, blood clots leading to strokes, especially in older smokers). At the same time, the press reported on the finding that certain cancers and pelvic infections were less likely to develop among contraceptive users. Searle's Enovid quickly became known simply as \"the Pill.\" There was a sudden and profound effect on the social and emotional lives of the population. Effective and independent of the sex act, the Pill was hailed by women because it emancipated them from unwanted pregnancies. Sanger's dream for birth control was at last a reality, and discussion of sexual matters had become front-page news. Conservatives railed against looser moral standards, and the Roman Catholic Church roundly condemned the Pill. Nonetheless, by 1966 about 20 percent of American Catholic wives were Pill users. The American birthrate had been climbing in the 1950s, even after the postwar \"baby boom,\" to a 1957 peak of twenty-five births per 1,000 in population. By 1966 this number fell to 19.1 per 1,000. Federal birth-control program clinics had a 50 percent increase in use of the Pill between 1960 and 1965 alone. Now, poor or disadvantaged women could have prescriptions of the Pill for very little or no cost. Abortion rates, too, fell dramatically. In 1964 four other companies marketed a version of the Pill, and in 1966 two companies marketed \"morning-after\" progesterone pills. During the 1960s the media proclaimed a \"sexual revolution.\" Family planning became more precise. With the Pill, newlyweds felt confident that a first child would not catch them emotionally and financially unprepared. Middle-aged couples were better protected against late-life \"accidents.\" Much media attention focused on teenagers, and many questions were asked: Just how old should a teenager be before being allowed to take the Pill? Did parents have the right to prevent their daughters from seeking a prescription for the Pill? Discussions on these moral issues, among others, still revolve around the Pill. Moreover, the media still questions whether the Pill initiated the sexual revolution of the 1960s or whether it was simply a by-product of the times. Nonetheless, by 1975 there were thirty million Pill users worldwide. In 2001 there were one hundred million users. After Searle retired in 1966, his eldest son became president, and his second son and son-in-law became vice presidents of the family's firm, continuing another generation of what is now a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical giant. At the age of seventy-eight, Searle died of natural causes in his winter home in Hobe Sound, Florida. He was buried in the churchyard of Christ Episcopal Church, Winnetka, Illinois. There is no book-length biography of Searle. Oral contraceptives are discussed regularly in the bimonthly P</body></html>",

Among the new products were the laxative Metamucil; Aminophyllin, for treatment of respiratory disorders; and Dramamine, which was developed as an antihistamine but was discovered to be the most effective remedy for motion sickness. The company's fortune rested, however, on developing the first effective and inexpensive oral contraceptive for women. The social activist Margaret Sanger had pioneered family planning and birth control in America. In 1923 she opened the first family planning clinic in New York City. During the 1920s Sanger organized medical conferences concerning hormonal contraceptives, while fundamental research was sponsored by the philanthropist Mrs. Page McCormick. The principle of oral contraceptives, using artificially synthesized derivatives of natural steroid hormones, was understood theoretically in the 1920s. Estrogen and progesterone are natural steroid hormones. Estrogen makes possible the growth of the endometrium, a membrane that lines the womb. It is present in the early stage of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone produces a mucus substance in the lower lining of the womb and inhibits the passage of sperm. It is present in the late part of the menstrual cycle. In 1937 researchers noted that synthetic progesterone could inhibit ovulation during the early menstrual cycle in rabbits, but at $200 a gram the synthetic progesterone was very expensive. During the early 1950s it was discovered that progesterone could be simulated with synthetic steroids made from a wild Mexican yam. Margaret Sanger urged Mrs. McCormick to fund further research at the Rock Reproductive Clinic in Brookline, Massachusetts. There, John Rock had been studying the promotion of fertility. Meanwhile, the physicians M. C. Chang and Gregory Pincus, at the Worchester (Massachusetts) Foundation for Experimental Biology, were researching estrogen. Rock found that when hormones to induce fertility over months of treatment were stopped, a significant percentage of women became pregnant (\"the Rock rebound\"). Chang and Pincus discovered that progesterone was effective in inhibiting pregnancy. The three researchers then collaborated on experiments that combined dosages of estrogen and progesterone. In animal tests even a low dosage effectively controlled menstrual bleeding. Moreover, by starting the dosage five days after the menstrual period began and ending it on the twenty-fourth day, ovulation was effectively inhibited. In 1956 Rock's collaborator, Celso Ramon Garcia, conducted extensive clinical trials. Searle then developed a sequential dosage of estrogen, followed by a dosage of combined estrogen and progestrogen. The sequential dosage was first marketed in 1957 under the trade name Enovid, packaged in a round plastic tray so that the proper pill would be taken during each day of a menstrual cycle. In 1966 Searle marketed Ovulen, which reduced the dosage of estrogen while remaining equally effective. When the pills were discontinued, fertility returned rapidly. G. D. Searle, Inc., boosted its sales from $37 million in 1960 to almost $89 million in 1965. Almost half its business came from Enovid, which cost $2.50 retail per month. A prescription lasted six months, and doctors monitored women for any side effects. During the early 1960s minor side effects (weight gain, headaches, nausea) were noted in a tiny percentage of users. By the mid-1960s there were many press reports of rare major side effects (among them, blood clots leading to strokes, especially in older smokers). At the same time, the press reported on the finding that certain cancers and pelvic infections were less likely to develop among contraceptive users. Searle's Enovid quickly became known simply as \"the Pill.\" There was a sudden and profound effect on the social and emotional lives of the population. Effective and independent of the sex act, the Pill was hailed by women because it emancipated them from unwanted pregnancies. Sanger's dream for birth control was at last a reality, and discussion of sexual matters had become front-page news. Conservatives railed against looser moral standards, and the Roman Catholic Church roundly condemned the Pill. Nonetheless, by 1966 about 20 percent of American Catholic wives were Pill users. The American birthrate had been climbing in the 1950s, even after the postwar \"baby boom,\" to a 1957 peak of twenty-five births per 1,000 in population. By 1966 this number fell to 19.1 per 1,000. Federal birth-control program clinics had a 50 percent increase in use of the Pill between 1960 and 1965 alone. Now, poor or disadvantaged women could have prescriptions of the Pill for very little or no cost. Abortion rates, too, fell dramatically. In 1964 four other companies marketed a version of the Pill, and in 1966 two companies marketed \"morning-after\" progesterone pills. During the 1960s the media proclaimed a \"sexual revolution.\" Family planning became more precise. With the Pill, newlyweds felt confident that a first child would not catch them emotionally and financially unprepared. Middle-aged couples were better protected against late-life \"accidents.\" Much media attention focused on teenagers, and many questions were asked: Just how old should a teenager be before being allowed to take the Pill? Did parents have the right to prevent their daughters from seeking a prescription for the Pill? Discussions on these moral issues, among others, still revolve around the Pill. Moreover, the media still questions whether the Pill initiated the sexual revolution of the 1960s or whether it was simply a by-product of the times. Nonetheless, by 1975 there were thirty million Pill users worldwide. In 2001 there were one hundred million users. After Searle retired in 1966, his eldest son became president, and his second son and son-in-law became vice presidents of the family's firm, continuing another generation of what is now a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical giant. At the age of seventy-eight, Searle died of natural causes in his winter home in Hobe Sound, Florida. He was buried in the churchyard of Christ Episcopal Church, Winnetka, Illinois. There is no book-length biography of Searle. Oral contraceptives are discussed regularly in the bimonthly P",

Blending extensive musical training with intellect and brute force, the band quickly became successful in the early 1990s. At the end of the decade, band members became weary of the music and each other, prompting its dissolution. Hamilton reformed the band in 2004 with new personnel but the same desire to play loud, guitar-driven rock music. Singer and guitarist Page Hamilton brought Helmet together in early 1989 in New York, after leaving the avant-garde ensemble Band of Susans. Originally from Medford, Oregon, Hamilton wasn't always interested in music. While growing up, he worked at a local logging mill by day, and during the evenings he lit smudge pots under trees in the Harry and David fruit orchard to keep the buds from freezing. \"I was just a really nice little small-town geek who wanted to play baseball and football,\" Hamilton told In his senior year of high school, the music of After graduating from the University of Oregon with a major in jazz and classical guitar, Hamilton moved to New York to get his master's degree in jazz guitar at the Manhattan School of Music. He had never heard of New York's popular rock clubs like the Mudd Club or CBGB, but he did frequent the Village Vanguard, where his hero, jazz artist John Coltrane, had played. Hamilton soon hooked up with minimalist composer Glenn Branca's famous guitar orchestra and then went on to play with wall-of-sound, Branca-influenced Band of Susans. He played on the album \"Band of Susans and the whole distortion thing got me back into rock,\" Hamilton explained in \"If you're a dedicated musician, you're interested in learning everything you can about music, so for me it's never been a matter of some sort of 'purity of punk' that you shouldn't play well,\" Hamilton told Reyne Cuccuro, a friend of Hamilton's who worked at the music-trade magazine Originally from Portland, Oregon, Bogdan had played with Portland's punk pioneers Poison Idea. When he saw Hamilton and Mengede's ad, he was already disillusioned with rock, preferring to concentrate on his career as a scenic artist and studio assistant to the minimalist painter Frank Stella. Still, he decided to reply to the ad because of their shared interests in Branca, The Cramps, and the early No Wave post-punk scene influences. Drummer John Stanier had moved to New York from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. After he graduated from high school, Stanier studied orchestral percussion at the University of Miami and then dropped out. He had developed a combination of control, power, and endurance through years of playing with the drum and bugle corps in his hometown. He performed with Fort Lauderdale hardcore bands while building his technique in the nationally known drum corps Florida Wave and Sunco Sound. Once the band cemented, the musicians recorded a demo tape that got the attention of Tom Hazelmeyer, the owner of the Minneapolis-based independent label Amphetamine Reptile Records. He decided to sign Helmet to his label. The band released its first single, \"Born Annoying\" and \"Rumble,\" six months after the band had formed. In 1990, Helmet released its debut album, Helmet released Interscope Records re-released \"Until February 17, 1993,\" Mengede replied in In March of 1993, Mengede was replaced by Rob Echeverria, who had played in some early New York hardcore bands including Straight Ahead and Rest in Pieces. After finishing their '93 tour, Helmet made its break into film soundtracks. They collaborated with House of Pain for the song \"Just Another Victim\" on the In the summer of 1994, Helmet released its third album, Popular and critical opinion were split. \" Helmet continued contributing to film soundtracks with a song for In 1997, Helmet went back in the studio without its full line up. The resulting CD was Chris Traynor (who had played in the band Orange 9mm) filled in on guitar for the remainder of the tour. But Helmet wasn't the same and it disbanded in 1999. Hamilton, in a 2004 interview with liveDaily, attributed the break up to the fact that the bandmates \"were not happy campers. We didn't communicate at all and we were sick of each other,\" he said. \"There was no point in continuing.\" Still, notice was taken. Critics pointed out that the band's influence could be heard in successive bands in various genres including System of a Down, Korn, and Limp Bizkit. In the hiatus, Hamilton performed and recorded various projects. This included a loose group with a bunch of New York-based friends in a group called Gandhi as well as collaborations with David Bowie, Uberzone, and Ben Neill. He performed on soundtracks for films including Hamilton opted, in 2002, to focus on songwriting. Late that year, he was introduced to John Tempesta--known best for his drumming stints in metal bands Testament and White Zombie, as well as performing on Rob Zombie's solo projects. When Zombie decided to concentrate on acting, Tempesta became a free agent. Hamilton and Tempesta contacted Traynor and they decided to see what would happen in the studio. The band officially reformed in 2004, with Hamilton, Traynor, Tempesta and Frank Bello (ex-Anthrax) playing bass. Hamilton, in an interview with liveDaily attributed the reformation of the band largely to the insistence Interscope Records' Jimmy Iovine. When word of the trio's studio dabbling leaked out, various labels intrigued. \"[Interscope] was sort of a warm, fuzzy place with comfortable people I knew and trusted and wanted to work with again. As far as a label, it made perfect sense. That was how this album came together,\" Hamilton said. \"I never felt it was musically done,\" Hamilton told The album was \"People will have different reactions to a new album and an album with different personnel. But it still sounds like Helmet. The bottom line is, it's in the writing, and that's the sort of thing that's specific about Helmet,\" Hamilton said in that same liveDaily interview. \"I know some people will miss [former Helmet members] John Stanier and Henry [Bogdan], who's an amazing musician. But they're doing their own thing. ... They didn't want to be doing this. These guys that I'm working with couldn't be anymore enthusiastic.\" Before the hiatus, Hamilton told",

Spheeris was abused as a child but says she bears no grudge. \"My mother had been abused herself,\" she told Bernstein. \"She had it rough.

His most influential material came from his work during the early to mid-1960s, and his songs \"Only the Lonely,\" \"Running Scared,\" \"It's Over,\" \"Down the Line,\" \"Cryin',\" and \"In Dreams,\" among others, would support his career for decades. Although Orbison's stage show would remain essentially the same from the mid-1960s until his death in 1988, he insisted that he didn't tire of repeatedly singing the same songs. \"Gracious, no, because I've worked a lifetime to do a show of just my own material,\" Orbison told Orbison credited the lasting impact of his music to a certain innocence in his songs. He noted in Born in Vernon, Texas, to a musical family (his father played Jimmie Rodgers songs and his uncle was a blues artist), Orbison made his performing debut at age eight and was soon regularly playing on local radio stations. In high school he formed the Wink Westerners, which played mostly western swing music, and when Orbison went off to college at North Texas State College, he rechristened the group the Teen Kings. While in college the group recorded a raucous rockabilly tune called \"Ooby Dooby,\" which eventually caught the attention of Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, who rereleased it to become a mild hit in 1956. On the heels of his first hit, Orbison cut a number of sides for Sun during the mid- to late 1950s, and although his career as a minor rockabilly star was booming, he grew increasingly tired of this music and the energetic stage presence it required. By the late 1950s Orbison had severed his ties with Phillips and Sun and had moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to write songs for the country music publishing powerhouse Acuff-Rose. The ballad \"Claudette,\" written about his wife, became a hit for the Everly Brothers. Interested in returning to his own singing career, Orbison--with the help of Wesley Rose--signed with Fred Foster at the newly opened Monument in 1959 and the same year released \"Uptown,\" which rose high enough on Billboard's pop chart to suggest that Orbison could maintain a career as a singer. By 1960, with the release of \"Only the Lonely,\" Orbison had embraced what would become his unique presence in pop music. With this song, he exercised his vocal range and introduced audiences to the power of his voice, which Clayson noted would stretch to \"an impossible six octaves.\" Duane Eddy commented, according to Clayson, that \"when you thought he'd sung as high as he possibly could, he would effortlessly go higher and finish up with a big finish and it was wonderful.\" \"Only the Lonely\" soon hit number two on the Hot 100 in the United States and topped the charts in both Australia and Great Britain. Although Orbison had already been dying his hair black for years, he soon incorporated what would become his trademark black attire and sunglasses into his stage act. He dropped his hip-shaking stage acrobatics in favor of a much more emotionally composed vocal style and austere stage presence. Deciding to let his voice stand on its own, Orbison would remain almost motionless onstage. Orbison's voice opened pop music to manly emotions. About his song \"Cryin',\" Orbison told After the success of \"Pretty Woman,\" Orbison signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for a contract estimated at more than $1 million. And soon the emotions Orbison displayed in his songs became tragically real when his wife, Claudette, died in a motorcycle accident in 1966 and again when two of his three children died in a fire in 1968. Orbison found happiness again in 1969 when he married Barbara Wellhoener-Jakobs, a German woman he had met while on tour. The couple had another two children, and Orbison returned to performing. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Orbison continued to tour the world. His stage presence won over audiences for years. He received a standing ovation when he toured in the United Kingdom with the Beatles in 1963 and later charmed adolescent audiences when on tour with the Eagles in the early 1980s. By 1980 Orbison's duet with Emmylou Harris of \"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\" won the pair a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group. Although Orbison is often associated with countrified pop music, his duet with Harris was the only time he ever made the country charts. Once produced by the influential Chet Atkins and backed by musicians of the \"Nashville sound,\" Orbison was Nashville's first major pop success. Even though--as Bruce Springsteen noted at Orbison's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame--\"no one sings like Roy Orbison,\" many artists have enjoyed the rewards of recording Orbison's songs and trying to mimic his vocal style. Springsteen borrowed much from Orbison for his Orbison's career was given an unconventional boost in 1986 when movie director David Lynch featured \"In Dreams\" during a brutal scene in By 1988 Orbison's career was regaining momentum--he recorded a hit single, \"You Got It,\" and completed an album with songs and production by Costello, U2's Bono and The Edge, and Lynne--but before that record was released he died at home of a heart attack on December 6, 1988. Orbison's tremendous influence on modern music did not end with his death. His widow, Barbara, worked hard to keep his legacy alive, managing Orbison Enterprises, Orbison Records, Roy Orbison Music, and the Still Working Music Group and even releasing, in 2009, a Pretty Woman perfume. In 2008 Barbara and son Roy Jr. released a comprehensive four-CD box set of all 107 of Orbison's recordings, beginning with the 1956 recording of \"Ooby Dooby\" and ending with a haunting version of \"It's Over,\" taped just two days before the artist's death. In 2011 the music industry rallied to celebrate Orbison's seventy-fifth birthday year with a variety of tributes, including a display of memorabilia at the Grammy museum in Los Angeles. Other acknowledgements included a special CD release by national coffee giant Starbucks; an Orby Records tribute album featuring a number of musicians covering Orbison songs; and special Roy Orbison selections on popular rock music video games Rock Band 3, Guitar Hero, and Sing Star. Most significant, perhaps, was the release of the Though Orbison is identified with an elemental simplicity that was the heart of early rock and roll, his legacy has kept up with the technological times. There is a Roy Orbison YouTube channel and a Roy Orbison presence on MySpace and Facebook. In the early 2000s, a Roy Orbison website was launched, which featured, along with information about Orbison recordings and history, a \"six degrees of separation\" game in which fans could enter the name of any musician and find his or her connection to Orbison--a twenty-first-century method of proving Orbison's deeply felt influence on American music. In 2008 \"Pretty Woman\" was added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry, marking it as a song of significant national importance. Kembrew McLeod",

The rock quartet of Trey Anastasio, Page McConnell, Mike Gordon, and Jon Fishman became one of the most successful rock groups ever, having sold more than three million albums and earning more than $10 million on tours alone. The band was a modern anomaly in the rock music scene, growing to stardom without the assistance of MTV or commercial radio. Phish is most often compared to the Grateful Dead. Like the Deadheads before them, Phish Heads grew in number as a result of the group's live shows, as the band toured constantly in the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. Fans filled venue parking lots a day before the show, establishing a temporary community. True Phish Heads lived this carnival life and followed the band from city to city until tour's end. In 2004 the group broke up to allow members to pursue individual projects. Musically, the band's shows were mostly improvisational jam sessions, and their musical menu served up a wide range of styles including rock, jazz, blues, funk, Latino, classical, calypso, and folk. The often fantastical lyrics that accompanied the myriad of rhythms were influenced by J.R. Tolkien's Phish came together in 1983, when two University of Vermont students, freshman Trey Anastasio and sophomore Jeff Holdsworth, began playing their guitars together in dorm lounges. They both shared an interest in the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers, Frank Zappa, and Led Zeppelin. The two fledging band members found their first recruit in University of Vermont freshman Jon \"Fish\" Fishman. Drummer Fishman told Puterbaugh, \"[Anastasio] and a friend were having a conversation about who looked like they belonged there and who didn't. I came walking by, and they both fell down laughing. They pegged me from a hundred yards in a crowd of people, going, 'He doesn't look like he belongs here.'\" With two guitarists and a drummer, the band then needed a bass player. Anastasio posted a sign for a bass player, and Mike Gordon responded. The group derived their name from Fishman's nickname, and Fishman's short, bearded, and bespectacled appearance helped personify the band's offbeat persona. Holdsworth got the band their first gig after seeing a flyer for an ROTC party on campus. Using hockey sticks for microphone stands, the group did not incite rapt attention from their first audience. They were given the boot after their fourth song, when the DJ blasted Michael Jackson's After a year of playing in campus dorms, the band felt they were ready to hit the city of Burlington. They became regulars at Nectar, a popular downtown restaurant and bar, where they experimented with their music and put together an original stage show. The band interacted with the audience, allowing fans to read poetry or perform on stage. \"All music is conversation,\" Fishman explained to Charles Hirshberg and Nubar Alexanion of For the next two years the band played regular gigs at Nectar and at various Burlington bars. In 1985 Phish picked up a fifth member in Page McConnell, a student at Goddard College. McConnell not only convinced the band they needed a keyboard player, he also managed to convince Anastasio, Holdsworth, and Fishman to transfer to Goddard College. McConnell was rewarded with fifty dollars for recruiting each of the band's members. Gordon, however, remained at the University of Vermont to study film. In 1986 the band lost one band member when Holdsworth became a born-again Christian. Despite the loss, the band continued playing, developing their music and stage shows. From 1988 to 1990, the band had two independent releases, The band's big recording break came while playing a show at Manhattan's Marquee club. A talent scout from Elektra Entertainment, Sue Drew, was intrigued by the group's sound and by the strange community that surrounded them. Drew gave her pitch, outlining the great success to come if the band signed to Elektra Entertainment. The members just listened, politely disinterested, as they did not want to become tied to commercial success. The band enjoyed their freedom to experiment and create unpredictable music, even encouraging fans to tape their shows and setting up sound boards to help fans get high quality recordings. Elektra was not pleased with this policy, but eventually relented in order to get the band signed. On the road in 1992, the band was gaining exposure. Phish played four shows on the first HORDE tour. The radio play and large outdoor amphitheaters gave the band a much wider audience, although it caused some stirrings from their once-underground fan base, who were concerned the band would be discovered and their community would be destroyed. In 1993 Things really began to move when the band released In the fall of 1994, a new tradition was established. Phish played the entire Beatles' In 1995 the band released a double album, From 1997 to 1999, Phish hosted yearly multi-day festivals that drew tens of thousands of fans. The last of these was performed at Big Cypress Indian Reservation on December 30 and 31, 1999, to celebrate the Millenium Eve. The event attracted more than 80,000 fans. Starting at midnight New Year's Eve, the band played a continuous seven-hour set until dawn on New Year's Day. After the herculean set of New Year's Eve 1999, the band took a sabbatical from festivals. By 2000 the members had agreed to an extended timeout from touring, with members pursuing solo projects. Anastasio worked with the group Oysterhead and was a guest conductor for the Vermont Youth Orchestra. Gordon focused on traditional bluegrass while also working with solo guitarist and singer Leo Kottke. Fishman became of a member of Jazz Mandolin Project as well as Pork Tornado. McConnell formed the trio Vida Blue. In the meantime, they released In 2003 members of the group reunited to perform at the IT festival in August. By this point the band had been together for 20 years, and to celebrate they performed a series of shows at the end of the year in Boston. Not quite ready to jump back into performing at their former pace, the band continued to tour but with frequent breaks. In the spring of 2004, just a month before the release of the album The Coventry festival drew record crowds and record determination by both the band and its fans. A week's worth of rain made it impossible for the majority of attendees to bring cars onto the farm property where the event was being held. Asked to turn back, fans instead parked their cars along the highway and walked to the site. Some walked more than ten miles to experience the jam band's last concert. Phish ended up performing memorable sets that had McConnell and Anastasio breaking down in tears at several points. The show ended without an encore or the typical after-show music played over the loudspeakers. Instead, fans were left to walk away from an empty stage and silence. Throughout the late 2000s, Phish continued to release compilations of live performances on their own label, JEMP. Releases included 2006's Having established themselves as one of the most popular self-made jam bands of the 1990s, Phish's abrupt ending in 2004 left many fans feeling stranded. Although some felt the band's timing was right, it was possible that the members might still have some unfinished business and a few jams left in them as a group. It was also evident that Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, and McConnell had enough talent to sustain themselves individually, and perhaps enough gusto to recreate the energy they left behind.</body></html>",

Rarely, however, does a band combine teenage longings with the seemingly discordant theme of religious awakening in such a collision of musical genres as the Violent Femmes. The Femmes have been preaching this formidable combination of sounds and images with their unique brand of neo-punk, hardcore acoustic music since their formation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the early 1980s. The band's unusual album content sets them apart from the crowd and forces listeners to reassess the dividing lines between rock, punk, folk, jazz, and country and western. Musician contributor David Fricke hailed the band as \"a fresh wind of post-punk originality rooted in rockabilly simplicity. [Their] songs vibrate with an almost psychotic tension underlined by the Femmes' naked acoustic force.... The fatal charms of the Violent Femmes are a secret Milwaukee shouldn't keep to itself.\" Lead vocalist and songwriter Gordon Gano grew up playing violin and guitar while writing tunes that alternately seethed with religious imagery and poignantly repressed sexual desire. Gano, the son of an American Baptist minister, presents a split vision of the world that expresses an almost psychotic self-depravation. It was during his senior year in high school that Gano met future bandmate Brian Ritchie when they both performed at the same variety show. Ritchie, who played guitar and bass, later attended another of Gano's performances and asked him to open for his Irish folk duo. Gano, in turn, asked Ritchie to join him at a high school assembly where they belted out the pleading \"Gimme The Car,\" a teenage supplication for the wanton use of dad's coveted vehicle. As Ritchie recalled in Musician, \"It erupted into a near-riot. It was fantastic!\" In 1981 jazz-trained percussionist Victor DeLorenzo joined Gano and Ritchie and the Violent Femmes were officially formed--their name gleaned from an early 1970s grade-school insult. They rapidly became a Milwaukee mainstay, performing at coffeehouses and nightclubs across the city. Their ascension came one night in 1981, when members of the popular rock band the Pretenders noticed the Femmes performing outside of that evenings' concert venue and asked the trio to open the show. While most bands recall such stories with nostalgic repose, however, the Femmes maintain that their so-called breakthrough was just a matter of time. They told Melody Maker: \"It's been passed around the press to the point where it's like Chrissie Hynde [lead singer for the Pretenders] 'discovered' the Violent Femmes, when all she did was give us one gig. Which was great, it was the first time we ever played to 2,000 people. [But] we'd have gotten here without that.\" A contract with Slash Records followed in 1982. In 1983 the band made its debut with Violent Femmes, a trend-setting album fraught with raw sexual frustration and teenage fears. A writer for Billboard deemed the album \"a seminal document of hormonal angst and black humor.\" Cuts from Violent Femmes such as \"Blister in the Sun,\" \"Add It Up,\" and \"Kiss Off\"--fueled by lyrics like \"Why can't I get just one screw/ Believe me I know what to do/ But something won't let me make love to you\" (\"Add It Up\") and \"You can all just kiss off into the air/ Behind my back I can see them stare/ They'll hurt me bad/ But I won't mind/ They'll hurt me bad/ They do it all the time\" (\"Kiss Off\")--quickly gained cult status around the world. The album's minimalist arrangements were for the most part created with just acoustic guitar, acoustic bass, snare drum, and the \"tranceaphone,\" DeLorenzo's invention of a tin bucket suspended over a tom. Gano's youthful, whining vocals emphasized loneliness, anger, and tension, which caused many reviewers to label the album as a \"teenage record.\" Gano disagreed. \"One thing I've often thought of certain songs, is that, rather than saying that they're the result of teen or adolescent (thinking), they're often not being expressed from the most mature of viewpoints, which to a greater or lesser degree people carry with them all their lives,\" he commented in the St. Louis Riverfront Times. The Femmes' follow-up album, 1984's Hallowed Ground, took a new, more introspective direction with an emphasis on religious imagery and a strong gospel tone. Many of the tracks focus on biblical themes, such as \"It's Gonna Rain,\" an upbeat version of the Noah's Ark story, and \"Jesus Walking on the Water,\" a straightforward tale of spiritual awakening. These songs are contrasted with unsettling tunes like \"Country Death Song,\" a psychotic confessional of a man who throws his daughter down the well and then hangs himself, and the sexually explicit \"Black Girls.\" The album's atypical content led reviewers and fans to question the motives and musical direction of the band. DeLorenzo, however, explained the groups's stylistic choices in a 1986 interview with Musician: \"Those songs are part of Gordon's make-up, and the idea of this band is to indulge ourselves musically and also to remain real people in doing so.\" Hallowed Ground was also the group's first album to feature The Horns of Dilemma, an aggregation of woodwind, brass, and string instruments which supplement the Femmes' basic acoustic unit. The Horns of Dilemma would later mutate into different musicians and/or instruments, depending upon the requirements of a certain album or a particular live show. \"We've had people come up and play comb with wax paper, a tabla player played with us in Boston,\" said Gano in Melody Maker. \"We've had oboe, sackbut, toy piano, Melodica, banjo--just about any instrument that you can think of.\" The release of The Blind Leading the Naked--produced by Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads (also a Milwaukee native)--in 1986 marked a turning point for the Violent Femmes. Blind is comprised of a diverse group of songs and styles--from the 33- second political outcry \"Old Mother Reagan\" to the cover of T. Rex's \"Children of the Revolution\"--that chronicle the band's musical growth. Blind also featured the widest range of instruments yet to appear on a Femmes album, including a greatly expanded Horns of Dilemma, and boasts vocals by all three band members. Ritchie summed up the Femmes' four-year evolution in Musician: \"We imposed a stylistic approach upon all the songs on the first album. Then we imposed a philosophy on the second album. On the third album we threw all our previous ideas out the window and decided to do each song as an individual song, the best we could do it.\" A two-year separation followed the release of Blind, with the bandmembers pursuing their own interests. Gano formed the rock-gospel band Mercy Seat and released a self-titled album in 1988, while Ritchie recorded three solo albums: The Blend (1987), Sonic Temple and the Court of Babylon (1989), and I See a Noise (1990). DeLorenzo's sole effort, Peter Corey Sent Me (1991), included his talents on guitar and keyboard on one track. The Femmes' next two albums, 3 (1988) and Why Do Birds Sing? (1991), both represented a return to their earlier, characteristic style. The rebirth of the Femmes led Rolling Stone reviewer David Browne to praise their efforts: \"Gordon Gano seems like the creepy kid next door who'll go off the deep end any minute, and the more he acts that way, the better the Violent Femmes are.\" Why Do Birds Sing? includes a skewed cover of Culture Club's 1983 hit \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\"--a song Gano performs like the vocal equivalent of the film Psycho's sexually repressed Norman Bates--contrasted with songs such as the lyrical \"Hey Nonny Nonny,\" based on a sixteenth-century shepherd's poem. The band also supplemented their album tours with appearances at the Earth Day festivities in 1992 and 1993. In 1993 the band's contract with Slash Records ended with the release of the compilation album Add It Up (1981-1993). Citing their incompatibility with Slash, Gano told the Phoenix New Times that \"they kept asking us if we could sound like R.E.M.\" Still, Add It Up is more than just a greatest hits collection. It is a testament to the Femmes 12-year musical odyssey and includes unreleased songs, demos, and live tracks--not to mention the humorous answering machine message left by Gano explaining that he had become locked inside his own house and hence would be late for the very first Femmes recording session. Drummer DeLorenzo left the band in 1993 and was replaced by Guy Hoffman, a founding member of another Milwaukee band, the BoDeans, and a member of the new-wave band The Oil Tasters. DeLorenzo's apparently amicable departure signaled the end of an era for the band, but the future of the Femmes seemed intact as Ritchie told the Milwaukee Journal that \"Guy understands where we're coming from. He knows the history of the band without having been a member.\" In 1994 the regrouped Femmes released New Times--produced by Gano and Ritchie--on the Elektra label. A Billboard contributor noted that this seventh album \"should please both the diehard fans of Violent Femmes' first album as well as those devotees who relish the band's growth and the continued maturation of Gano's songwriting.\" Gano revealed to Billboard that the change in labels is like \"going from a minor-league contract to a major-league contract.... We have a level of respect artistically that we've never had before.\" The first single from New Times was \"Breakin' Up,\" an angst-ridden commentary on relationships that nearly was included on the band's first album. Other selections include \"Mirror Mirror (I See a Damsel)\" that borrows a polka sound and the rocking \"Don't Start Me on the Liquor.\" With every album, the Violent Femmes have attempted to simultaneously confront the dichotomies of life and expand the definition of rock and roll. Although their combination of purity and depravity may be controversial, Gano explained his antithetical approach in Melody Maker: \"Heidegger said that a faith that doesn't perpetually keep itself open to the possibility of unfaith isn't even faith. I respond to that, but I feel that Violent Femmes songs do more good than bad when you hear them. But perhaps I'm totally wrong ... I could really be what some people already think of me--a borderline mentally ill person who's adding to the troubles but deludes himself he's doing some good.\"",

A meteor is a meteoroid that enters Earth's atmosphere, creating a streak of light as part of it burns. Meteors are also known as shooting stars. Most of them vaporize before reaching Earth's surface. A meteorite is a piece of a meteoroid that makes it all the way to the ground. Some meteorites are large enough to create large craters on Earth and other planets.  Size and Structure Meteoroids are fragments of comets or asteroids or other bits of rocky debris. They are the smallest of the objects floating around space, ranging in size from small pebbles to rocks about three feet (one meter) across. Most meteoroids come from comets; these are low density balls of dust. Meteoroids that break off asteroids are denser rocks. The vast majority of meteroids that enter Earth's atmosphere are quite tiny, pebble-sized or smaller and weighing only 1 to 2 grams. They create bursts of light because they enter the atmosphere at very high speeds, up to 160,000 miles per hour (72 km/sec). At these speeds, the impact of even a tiny particle with the atmosphere creates a great deal of kinetic energy that makes a bright flash of light, forming a long trail. This trail is usually no more than 3 feet (1 meter) wide, but can stretch across the sky for many miles.  Meteor Showers A meteor shower occurs when a large cloud of meteorites hits the atmosphere at the same time. This is usually the result of a comet flying by the Sun and leaving behind clouds of dust in its wake. When Earth's orbit intersects with a comet's orbit, Earth can experience meteor showers every year as it passes through the dust cloud. Several meteor showers have regular dates of occurrence, and it is easy to plan to view them. Specific dates vary from year to year. Some of the brighter meteor showers include:  The Leonid showers each November are caused by the tail of comet Tempel-Tuttle, which passes through the inner solar system every 32 to 33 years. The comet passed by Earth in 1998. On November 17 and 18 of that year, observers on Earth saw as many as 200 meteors an hour. The shower was so intense that scientists and others were worried that global telecommunications might be disrupted and space telescopes damaged or destroyed, though no major disruption actually occurred. Figuring out Meteor Showers Until the end of the eighteenth century, people believed that meteors and meteorites were atmospheric occurrences, like rain. In 1714 English astronomer Edmond Halley (1656–1742) reviewed reports of meteor sightings, calculated the height and speed of the objects, and concluded they must have come from space. Proof of Halley's theory came in 1803 when a fireball, accompanied by loud explosions, rained down 2,000 to 3,000 stones on northwestern France. French Academy of Science member Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774–1862) collected some of the fallen stones as well as reports from witnesses. After measuring the area covered by the debris and analyzing the stones' composition, Biot proved they could not have originated in Earth's atmosphere. In November 1833, astronomers observing a shower of thousands of shooting stars concluded that Earth must be running into the objects because they were all falling in parallel, like a train moving into falling rain. People knew that certain meteor showers occurred at regular times. Every November meteors that appeared to originate from the constellation Leo flashed across the sky; this was called the Leonid meteor shower. Another shower, called the Perseid meteor shower, seemed to radiate from the constellation Perseus every August. Astronomers began to suspect that Earth was crossing the paths of clouds of meteoroids in its yearly orbit around the Sun. Italian scientist Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) calculated the velocity and path of the Perseid and Leonid meteor showers. He found they circled the Sun in orbits similar to those of comets. He concluded that the paths of comets and meteor swarms were identical. Most annual meteor showers can now be traced to the orbit of a comet that intersects Earth's orbit.</body></html>",

Roumain (who goes by his initials, DBR) has been credited with helping to redefine the form and broaden the scope of classical music, giving it a fresh relevance, especially among young people. In his works, DBR has combined classically influenced pieces with musical genres such as jazz, rock, electronica, and, especially, hip-hop. He writes for orchestra, chamber orchestra, string quartet, solo instrument, voice, and rock band. The compositions match DBR's main instrument, the violin, with a variety of ambient and electronic sounds, such as spoken dialogue and sampled beats. He often works with DJs, dancers, and performance artists, as well as with other composers and musicians such as avant-garde composer Philip Glass, jazz vocalist Cassandra Wilson, and turntable artist DJ Spooky (Paul Miller). Characteristically, DBR draws on African American subjects and themes for his works, often using issues of race as his inspiration. For example, he dedicated a series of string quartets to prominent figures in the civil rights movement: Malcolm X; Martin Luther King, Jr.; Adam Clayton Powell; and Maya Angelou. Compared to classical composers Mozart and Beethoven, as well as to funk-rockers Prince and Lenny Kravitz, DBR appears onstage wearing dreadlocks, piercings, and tattoos, a look that captures the attention of younger audiences. As an educator, he is well known as the creator of the Young Composers Program that is part of the Orchestra of St. Luke's in New York City, where he is assistant composer-in-residence. As part of his curriculum, he has introduced youthful composers and string players to classical music flavored with hip-hop, and has inspired them to compose pieces in their own styles. DBR plays approximately twenty instruments, including violin, piano, guitar, bass, viola, and drums, and also does occasional vocals. He also leads DBR's Mission, an eight-piece band that includes an amplified string quartet as well as a bassist, drummer, keyboardist, and DJ. Born in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, DBR moved to southern Florida as a small child and grew up in the Fort Lauderdale area. His parents, immigrants from Haiti, had a strong impact on his musical development. They introduced him to Haitian folk music as well as to a wide variety of classical and contemporary music. As a youngster he listened to the country/rock band the Eagles, Swedish popsters ABBA, R&amp;B legend Stevie Wonder, the works of Beethoven, and ethnic music from the Cuban, Bahaman, Dominican, and Puerto Rican communities in southern Florida. At the age of five he became infatuated with the violin. He began studying under the tutelage of bandleader Mitch Miller, who had a popular television series in the 1960s, and started to play in orchestras. As a sixth-grader, DBR played the electric guitar and synthesizer in his own band, which performed rock and hip-hop. As a student at Dillard High School for the Performing Arts in Sunrise, Florida, he played in the school jazz orchestra, backing such prominent musicians as Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles. After graduating from high school, DBR almost skipped college because he was producing and playing for the notoriously ribald Florida rap group 2Live Crew. Eventually, DBR's father convinced him to attend Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where he was awarded a full scholarship. Majoring in composition, he graduated with honors in 1993, and then earned master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he also conducted classical works. In 1998 he headed for New York City, settling in Harlem, a place with a rich political and cultural heritage that influenced his music. After arriving in New York, DBR worked as a rehearsal pianist for dance companies, among them the Julliard School, Joffrey Ballet, Dance Theatre of Harlem, Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance, and Alvin Ailey American Dance Center (now the Ailey School). He worked as much as 14 hours a day, seven days a week, while also working on his own compositions. In 1999 he won the Helen F. Whitaker Commission, an award given to him for his work As a composer, DBR has been recognized for his creativity, innovation, and musical sophistication. For his In 2000 DBR released a series of original recordings for his own label, DBR Music. These recordings included compositions that he wrote for the theater, concert hall, and club circuits, as well as for modern dance. In 2004 he premiered a solo show, In assessing DBR's career, observers have generally called him a boy wonder, a brilliant composer and a performer whose groundbreaking, varied works and unusual approach make him one of the most exciting young artists in music. By honoring history and tradition while exploring new ways of making music, DBR has earned respect in both the classical and pop worlds. He also is well regarded for his work with young people. Kozinn wrote, \"Mr. Roumain has found that once people get past the visual image and hear his inventive, energetic music. ... they want to hear more. And having seen him, they don't forget him.\" John Beck of the DBR confided to Kozinn, \"I used to be a black man. Then I became a black American composer. But if you ask me today how I feel, I'll tell you that I feel like a very lucky young man. ... I've been able to combine the music I grew up with ... and, in some ways, to be an ambassador, certainly for what's going on in Harlem, where I live, but also for what's going on in contemporary classical music. I think contemporary classical music has found its soul, or maybe regained its soul and found its heart.\" He told Paul Boakye of</body></html>",

Compared to classical composers Mozart and Beethoven, as well as to funk-rockers Prince and Lenny Kravitz, DBR appears onstage wearing dreadlocks, piercings, and tattoos, a look that captures the attention of younger audiences. As an educator, he is well known as the creator of the Young Composers Program that is part of the Orchestra of St. Luke's in New York City, where he is assistant composer-in-residence. As part of his curriculum, he has introduced youthful composers and string players to classical music flavored with hip-hop, and has inspired them to compose pieces in their own styles. DBR plays approximately twenty instruments, including violin, piano, guitar, bass, viola, and drums, and also does occasional vocals. He also leads DBR's Mission, an eight-piece band that includes an amplified string quartet as well as a bassist, drummer, keyboardist, and DJ. Born in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, DBR moved to southern Florida as a small child and grew up in the Fort Lauderdale area. His parents, immigrants from Haiti, had a strong impact on his musical development. They introduced him to Haitian folk music as well as to a wide variety of classical and contemporary music. As a youngster he listened to the country/rock band the Eagles, Swedish popsters ABBA, R&B legend Stevie Wonder, the works of Beethoven, and ethnic music from the Cuban, Bahaman, Dominican, and Puerto Rican communities in southern Florida. At the age of five he became infatuated with the violin. He began studying under the tutelage of bandleader Mitch Miller, who had a popular television series in the 1960s, and started to play in orchestras. As a sixth-grader, DBR played the electric guitar and synthesizer in his own band, which performed rock and hip-hop. As a student at Dillard High School for the Performing Arts in Sunrise, Florida, he played in the school jazz orchestra, backing such prominent musicians as Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles. After graduating from high school, DBR almost skipped college because he was producing and playing for the notoriously ribald Florida rap group 2Live Crew. Eventually, DBR's father convinced him to attend Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where he was awarded a full scholarship. Majoring in composition, he graduated with honors in 1993, and then earned master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he also conducted classical works. In 1998 he headed for New York City, settling in Harlem, a place with a rich political and cultural heritage that influenced his music. After arriving in New York, DBR worked as a rehearsal pianist for dance companies, among them the Julliard School, Joffrey Ballet, Dance Theatre of Harlem, Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance, and Alvin Ailey American Dance Center (now the Ailey School). He worked as much as 14 hours a day, seven days a week, while also working on his own compositions. In 1999 he won the Helen F. Whitaker Commission, an award given to him for his work As a composer, DBR has been recognized for his creativity, innovation, and musical sophistication. For his In 2000 DBR released a series of original recordings for his own label, DBR Music. These recordings included compositions that he wrote for the theater, concert hall, and club circuits, as well as for modern dance. In 2004 he premiered a solo show, In assessing DBR's career, observers have generally called him a boy wonder, a brilliant composer and a performer whose groundbreaking, varied works and unusual approach make him one of the most exciting young artists in music. By honoring history and tradition while exploring new ways of making music, DBR has earned respect in both the classical and pop worlds. He also is well regarded for his work with young people. Kozinn wrote, \"Mr. Roumain has found that once people get past the visual image and hear his inventive, energetic music. ... they want to hear more. And having seen him, they don't forget him.\" John Beck of the DBR confided to Kozinn, \"I used to be a black man. Then I became a black American composer. But if you ask me today how I feel, I'll tell you that I feel like a very lucky young man. ... I've been able to combine the music I grew up with ... and, in some ways, to be an ambassador, certainly for what's going on in Harlem, where I live, but also for what's going on in contemporary classical music. I think contemporary classical music has found its soul, or maybe regained its soul and found its heart.\" He told Paul Boakye of",

The first single from his band's debut album became a surprise hit in 1996, earning radio and MTV airplay and establishing Stuart as one of the mid-1990s new rock ironists. Dog's Eye View--which consists of Stuart on guitar and vocals, Tim Bradshaw on guitars, vocals, and piano, Dermot Lynch on bass, and Alan Bezozi on drums and percussion--was assembled by Stuart around 1995 in New York, after Stuart generated a buzz among record company executives for his solo singer-songwriter act. Music played an early and important role in Stuart's life. Hard-hit by the unexpected death of his father Fredric when he was a young child, Stuart found himself comforted by Cat Stevens' Tea for the Tillerman. As Stuart recalled later in his Columbia Records biography, \"I went home and put it on. Here was this song called 'Father and Son'; all of a sudden, there was this songwriter who talked about a relationship between a father and a son and that kind of blew my head apart. I've always felt that every generation needs to hear about the same things in a different way because times change and people change.... I've always sought out those transcendent moments where you listen to something and it affects you very deeply.\" \"Waterline,\" a song from Stuart's debut album, was reportedly written about his father. A New York native and the product of an upper-middle-class suburban family, Stuart attended high school on Long Island. Educated at Northwestern University, he began his performing career in Chicago, where the view from his basement apartment inspired his band's name. Stuart started on the road as an acoustic solo artist, playing guitar and singing on the small club circuit. Building a fan base by establishing a mailing list and keeping in touch with listeners through e-mail, Stuart sold more than 6,000 copies of a three-track homemade demo tape that contained early versions of \"Waterline\" and \"Shine,\" which both also ended up on his debut album. After spotting Stuart perform, Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz invited Stuart to tour with Duritz's group. Serving as both an opening act and a roadie, Stuart spent six months on the road with the Crows in 1994--exposure that attracted the attention of Columbia Records executives, who subsequently signed his band to a record contract. Along with his bandmates, Stuart recorded Dog's Eye View's first album, Happy Nowhere, in Woodstock, New York, in a rented house. After writing all of the songs for the record, Stuart also co- produced his band's debut with James Burton. Although promotion for the album started around the fall of 1995, Columbia officially released Happy Nowhere on January 30, 1996. Because Stuart was probably best-known to audiences as a solo artist, Columbia's promotional efforts included emphasizing the fact that Dog's Eye View consisted of not only Stuart, but also Bezozi, Bradshaw, and Lynch. The band achieved national prominence via \"Everything Falls Apart,\" one of the singles from that album. The wry song became a radio staple in the summer of 1996. With the single drawing attention to the band, Dog's Eye View spent more than a year on the road in support of the record. For the band's follow-up, 1997's Daisy, the New Yorkers of Dog's Eye View headed west to Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington. By the time the album hit store shelves, Stuart had relocated to Seattle. Produced by Matt Wallace, the more mature Daisy featured Duritz as a guest vocalist. Besides Duritz, contributors to the album included multi-instrumentalist and producer Jon Brion, who also co-wrote songs for and worked on former 'Til Tuesday leader Aimee Mann's first two solo records. That Stuart's list of friends and associates reads like a who's who of modern rock has no doubt enhanced his career success. Stuart's pals included the likes of folk singer Jewel, the acclaimed late singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley, and Duritz. He has also toured with Tori Amos, Belly, Catherine Wheel, Cracker and Matthew Sweet. Contact with more established artists helped teach Stuart important lessons about the music business. Counting Crows \"'told me what deals consist of, and I learned what to stand up for and demand and what wasn't worth fighting for,\" Stuart is quoted as saying in Billboard. In the same article, he stated that Amos advised him \"'to make your own record, and live or die by it. If you make it for the record company, they might turn against you if it stiffs, and if it's a hit, you might end up thinking it was all because of them and not you.'\" Maintaining control over his work has apparently paid off. Although not all critics have found favor with his work, Stuart has earned high marks for his songwriting skills. In a 1996 review of Happy Nowhere, People writer Craig Tomashoff wrote that the album contained \"the perfect balance between folkie-style introspective lyrics ... and intensely energetic pop hooks.\" Reviewing the band's debut, Mark Jenkins of the Washington Post wrote that Dog's Eye View \"purveys routinely tasteful adult rock,\" while in a 1997 review of Daisy, Jae-Ha Kim of Entertainment Weekly lauded Stuart's \"knack for marrying bittersweet words with pop melodies to create evocative vignettes.\" Since breaking onto the airwaves in 1996, the music business-savvy Stuart has built a career that balances creativity and common sense. As he told Tracey Pepper in a 1997 interview in Interview, \"It's not about selling the most records; it's about my experience and progress as a human being. In thirty years I want to have learned more about the world.\"</body></html>",

Listening to everything from Ray Charles to Pink Floyd to ELO, Meldal-Johnsen knew members of groups like the Incredible String Band because of they were friends of his parents. He started playing bass in high school, and was a member of a number of alternative and punk garage bands. In this time period, Meldal-Johnsen saw his musical horizons expanded, and his interest in music as a career grew. After completing high school, Meldal-Johnsen studied at the Faunt School of Creative Music in Studio City, California, from 1988 to 1990, and took a job as a night janitor at the well-regarded Cherokee Studios in Hollywood, California.

Meldal-Johnsen played with Nine Inch Nails on its ornate \"Lights in the Sky\" tour that year. Not only did he contribute on bass, he also sang and played guitar, keyboards, and mandolin. Meldal-Johnsen was also part of Nine Inch Nails' Wave Goodbye farewell tour in 2009. Meldal-Johnsen then moved more extensively into producing, a process he found fascinating.

Even after the gloss becomes familiar, the strangeness of the vocabulary faintly suggests an ancient ceremonial conducted in a mystical code.... The expressive economy that MacDiarmid often claimed for the Scots dialect is evidenced not only in the idiomatic essence of \"eemis\" and \"yowdendrift,\" but in the frequency of apostrophic abbreviation. The poet's language in \"The Eemis Stane\" is more than the medium of expression; if actually seems to constitute the content of the expression, almost imagistically: the poem is more emblematic than informative. A substantial part of the poem's initial lunar strangeness, and therefore of one of its principal effects, derives from the implied characteristics of the narrative point of view. There is an explicit speaker.... With no evidence to the contrary, the reader assumes that the whole poem is spoken by this same persona. But the principal image... implies an unusual narrative situation, for the world moves against the sky, apparently as seen from some extraterrestrial vantage point. Is the speaker off the Earth? It would seem so except for one clue: \"hairst.\" The notion of the extraterrestrial narrator is weakened by the fact that he seems to perceive the harvest, which (barring of course the possibility that he stands in a cornfield on Mars) ties him to Earth. But the speaker's So the narrator, \"in reality\" earthbound, imaginatively views the whole rocking Earth. But his consciousness abruptly returns to the ground: \"my eerie memories fa'.\" The rapid shift through vast quasi-physical distances is a startling metaphorical device, portraying an equally vast and rapid internal shift in the speaker. The beauty of this poem is that its syntax mimes and fortifies this shift and elevates it to thematic significance. The first stanza portrays an essentially static situation until the noun modifier \"eemis,\" the first hint of any motion.... The second stanza brings this violent action to a grinding halt as the speaker's memories complete their fall from space to the Earth, from a state of lunar strangeness to one of frustration and negation. The \"stane\" of Earth has become a huge gravestone: the cosmic and the commonplace are united in the metaphor. But the speaker cannot even read the epitaph—it is obscured by history and, oddly enough, by fame. The activity of stanza one is reduced dramatically as the cosmic view shifts: the verbs in stanza two are presented in The tenses of the verbs reflect the movement from present activity to negative stasis in their shift from the present to a negative past subjunctive tense.... \"The Man in the Moon,\" the third lyric in \"Au Clair de Lune,\" uses an extraterrestrial metaphor similar to that in \"The Eemis Stane....\" This poem, again much like \"Eemis Stane,\" seems to express an inconclusiveness, dissatisfaction,m and negativism expressed in a strikingly metaphysical combination of the cosmic and the earthbound, the abstract and the concrete, the vast and the tiny. Once again the Earth is quite visible—it \"glitters,\" and is \"white\"—to the eye of the narrator, whose identity as a perceiver is thereby faintly implied. The position of the narrator is apparently extraterrestrial throughout the poem, a fact that instantly endows the lyric with an other-worldly strangeness similar to that of \"The Eemis Stane.\"... The speaker apparently has no firm answers. The poem is a remarkable statement of the dilemma of choice between an intellectual but superficial life and a concrete but comatose half-life. The poem does not firmly resolve, but hints at the superiority of the latter alternative, not only through the... implied comment by the speaker on Thought, but also through the syntax.... Hence, when the speaker criticizes slowly moving half-life of eternity and a rejection of the passive, static, superficial, ineffectual life of Thought. The preference, if there is one, is slight—the speaker's opinion remains essentially unresolved.... \"The Watergaw,\" from No other poem better illustrates the advantages that \"synthetic Scots\" offered MacDiarmid. The sound in this poem are beautiful.... The word \"watergaw\" is a precise word for a hazy phenomenon and therefore represents a perfect little piece of imagism. There is no satisfactory English equivalent for the word: \"rainbow\" connotes a sentimentality which \"watergaw\" does not, and which would be inappropriate to this poem. Indeed, this lyric is far from being mushy and sentimental, as the surprising presence of the word \"foolish\" indicates. \"Yow-trummle\" is an economical and ready-made metaphor in itself, and the idiomatic \"nae reek i' the laverock's hoose\" is impossible to duplicate readily in English. The poem seems to express the underplayed consternation and irresolution that characterize a good many of MacDiarmid's early works. A dark, stormy setting contributes to the gothic flavor of \"The Watergaw,\" as does the rhetorical form of the poem: an apostrophe to a dead person. The speaker, who self-consciously refers to himself six times, seems troubled by his memories; he seems to be struggling with the past. The first stanza recalls the moment at which the speaker perceived a watergaw and was instantly reminded of a dying look; the second stanza, embodying a mood not of complacency but rather of worry and irresolution, dwells on the significance of this brief epiphany.... But even though the speaker's statements of his associating the \"licht\" and the \"look\" may refer to both the present A diagram of the time sequence implied by the ordered occurrence of key words shows a series of forward movements strongly countered by thrusts back to the past, expressing the speaker's consistently uncomfortable concern with past events.... Stanza two begins the speaker's troubled contemplation of the watergaw's \"licht\" and the dying person's \"look.\" ...By the end of stanza two the speaker is unresolved and uncertain—he So in both stanzas the verbs indicate the speaker's attempt to bring his attention from the past to the present: he momentarily succeeds, then falls back to his uncomfortable memories. The verbal structure of \"The Watergaw\" reinforces the poem's thematic uneasiness and consternation.... [\"The Skeleton of the Future,\" one of MacDiarmid's transition from Scots to English but also demonstrates a few very important aspects of his politics and poetics. The poem praises the bones of Lenin;, and implies that the Communist Party... was the hope of man's future. As the title of the poem indicates, the basis of this short poem is an oxymoron, a fact which belies not only MacDiarmid's fondness for disrupting logic and devaluing Thought (cf. \"The Man in the Moon\") but also his admiration for metaphysical verse. Geology was one of MacDiarmid's personal interests—he used \"the stone\" as an important symbol not only in this poem but also in many of his earlier lyrics, and especially in his later poem \"On a Raised Beach.\" The use of specific types of stone in \"Skeleton of the Future\" also epitomizes MacDiarmid's penchant for the technical vocabularies of science generally.... Overtly a description of Lenin's tomb, the poem praises the simultaneous solidity and energy of Lenin's bones and implies praise for the permanence and the promise of the Communist system. The frequent mention of stones (\"granite,\" diorite,\" \"labradorite crystals,\" \"stones\") conveys the strong traditional sense of the permanence associated with rocks, a sense often manifested in the construction of tombstones and altars. In fact, there is a quasi-religious tone in this poem accountable to the implications of stone-symbolism, and the association by rhyme of \"stones\" and \"bones\" strongly enhances, almost deifies, Lenin's corpse. The poem's syntax cooperates with and contributes to the theme of the union of stasis and permanence with energy and promise: the poem contains no finite verbs. There are probably two \"sentences\" implied in the poem, separated by the semicolon, but as they stand, both are only complex nominals. The effect of a verbless construction strikingly reinforces the theme of rock-like stasis.... This syntactic construction mimes not only the architectural construction of the tomb, but also the psychological fixation of the speaker—he does not move As these brief analyses indicate,the early lyrics of Hugh MacDiarmid—and there are dozens of very good ones—generously repay critical attention.</body></html>",

The first stanza recalls the moment at which the speaker perceived a watergaw and was instantly reminded of a dying look; the second stanza, embodying a mood not of complacency but rather of worry and irresolution, dwells on the significance of this brief epiphany.... But even though the speaker's statements of his associating the \"licht\" and the \"look\" may refer to both the present A diagram of the time sequence implied by the ordered occurrence of key words shows a series of forward movements strongly countered by thrusts back to the past, expressing the speaker's consistently uncomfortable concern with past events.... Stanza two begins the speaker's troubled contemplation of the watergaw's \"licht\" and the dying person's \"look.\" ...By the end of stanza two the speaker is unresolved and uncertain—he So in both stanzas the verbs indicate the speaker's attempt to bring his attention from the past to the present: he momentarily succeeds, then falls back to his uncomfortable memories. The verbal structure of \"The Watergaw\" reinforces the poem's thematic uneasiness and consternation.... [\"The Skeleton of the Future,\" one of MacDiarmid's transition from Scots to English but also demonstrates a few very important aspects of his politics and poetics. The poem praises the bones of Lenin;, and implies that the Communist Party... was the hope of man's future. As the title of the poem indicates, the basis of this short poem is an oxymoron, a fact which belies not only MacDiarmid's fondness for disrupting logic and devaluing Thought (cf. \"The Man in the Moon\") but also his admiration for metaphysical verse. Geology was one of MacDiarmid's personal interests—he used \"the stone\" as an important symbol not only in this poem but also in many of his earlier lyrics, and especially in his later poem \"On a Raised Beach.\" The use of specific types of stone in \"Skeleton of the Future\" also epitomizes MacDiarmid's penchant for the technical vocabularies of science generally.... Overtly a description of Lenin's tomb, the poem praises the simultaneous solidity and energy of Lenin's bones and implies praise for the permanence and the promise of the Communist system. The frequent mention of stones (\"granite,\" diorite,\" \"labradorite crystals,\" \"stones\") conveys the strong traditional sense of the permanence associated with rocks, a sense often manifested in the construction of tombstones and altars. In fact, there is a quasi-religious tone in this poem accountable to the implications of stone-symbolism, and the association by rhyme of \"stones\" and \"bones\" strongly enhances, almost deifies, Lenin's corpse. The poem's syntax cooperates with and contributes to the theme of the union of stasis and permanence with energy and promise: the poem contains no finite verbs. There are probably two \"sentences\" implied in the poem, separated by the semicolon, but as they stand, both are only complex nominals. The effect of a verbless construction strikingly reinforces the theme of rock-like stasis.... This syntactic construction mimes not only the architectural construction of the tomb, but also the psychological fixation of the speaker—he does not move As these brief analyses indicate,the early lyrics of Hugh MacDiarmid—and there are dozens of very good ones—generously repay critical attention.",

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted its first official definition of what counts as a \"planet.\" Pluto did not meet the criteria of that definition and is now classified as a dwarf planet. Two other dwarf planets are Ceres, formerly classified as an asteroid, and Eris, a body about a third more massive than Pluto and located about three times farther from the sun. Pluto was discovered by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. He found the body while searching for the cause of variations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. Astronomers had become convinced that these variations were caused by a planet that had not yet been discovered. When Tombaugh first found Pluto, he decided that it was the expected planet. Forty eight years later, astronomers discovered Pluto's largest satellite, Charon. In 2005, two more smaller satellites, Nix and Hydra, where discovered. Pluto's orbit is unusual in several ways. It is highly irregular, carrying it 2.6 billion miles (7.4 billion km) from the sun at its farthest point and only 2.7 billion miles (4.34 billion km) at its nearest point. A small part of this orbit brings Pluto closer to the sun than Neptune, most recently from February, 1979 to February, 1999. Also, Pluto's rotational axis--with which Charon's orbit is aligned--is extremely tilted. In effect, Pluto' axis points almost in the direction it is traveling and Charon describes a helix or spiral path around Pluto's orbital path. This means that there are two periods during Pluto's 248-year orbit around the sun when the plane of Charon's orbit lines up directly with Earth and can be viewed \"edge-on.\" When this occurs, Charon's orbit takes it repeatedly in front of and behind Pluto (as seen from Earth). These conditions are called mutual events, and last occurred from 1985 to 1990. The repeated partial eclipsing of Pluto by Charon during a mutual event allows astronomersr to measure the brightness of different parts of Pluto's surface and so build up a blurry image of the planet that is still better than what can be seen through any telescope. Given the size of a satellite's orbit and how long it takes to orbit its planet, it is possible to calculate the combined mass of the two. Thus, by timing how long a mutual event lasts and measuring the speed of Charon, astronomers have obtained estimates of the sizes of Pluto and Charon. While most satellites are a small fraction of the size of the larger bodies they orbit, Charon's radius is almost exactly half that of Pluto. Many astronomers refer to Pluto and Charon as a \"double system.\" Astronomers have also measured the albedo (amount of reflected light) of both Pluto and Charon. Light reflected from an astronomical body is an important source of information about the planet's composition. Each element reflects a spectrum, or pattern of wavelengths, of light that is as unique as a human fingerprint. By studying reflected light at several wavelengths, astronomers can determine what elements are present on the surface of a planet. Pluto's surface spectrum indicates the presence of methane, while Charon's matches the spectrum of water ice. Given their distance from the aun, theoretical calculations show that Pluto is just large enough to retain a thin methane atmosphere, while Charon is not. Further confirmation of an atmosphere on Pluto was obtained in June, 1988 when Pluto (but not Charon) passed in front of a star. If Pluto had no atmosphere, the star would wink out suddenly as Pluto passed in front of it. Instead, it gradually dimmed before disappearing and reappeared gradually as well. Pluto, therefore, appears to have an atmosphere that extends about 620 miles (1,000 km) above the body's surface and has a temperature of between -370°F (-223°C) and -352°F (-213°C). Using a telescope in Hawaii to study the spectra of Pluto's atmosphere, scientists have concluded that nitrogen, and not methane, is the dominant element. Scientists have suggested that the atmosphere will condense to form surface frost as Pluto moves away from the sun in its orbit. The frost may actually migrate from one pole to the other during the plutonian year, similar to what is observed with the polar caps on Mars. Combining knowledge of the sizes of Pluto and Charon with the total mass of the system, astronomers can determine the mean (average) density of the system. This provides valuable information about the interior structure and composition of an astronomical body. Pluto's estimated mean density is about twice that of water, which means that Pluto has about 50 percent more rock in its interior than theories had predicted. Since the rock is denser than the ice forming the rest of the body, it is assumed to form a core about 510 to 572 miles (820 to 920 km) in radius. On top of the core is a rigid mantle of water ice 131 to 193 miles (210 to 310 km) thick. A crust of frozen methane 6.2 to 18.6 miles (10 to 30 km) thick forms the top layer of the body. Pressure and gravity at the surface are low. Pluto's surface gravity is only 1/29 that of Earth and its surface pressure is about 1/25,000 that of Earth. Pluto's methane crust is probably structurally weak: the surface temperature of Pluto is close enough to the melting point of methane that terrain features more than about 12 miles (20 km) long should smooth away in only a few million years. Because surface features of the methane layer relax so quickly, Pluto's surface is assumed to be geologically young and to contain few impact craters. However, telescopes in the vicinity of Earth can provide little information about Pluto's surface because the body is so small and far away. Even the Hubble Space Telescope is unable to resolve any but the largest features of the body's surface. The In June 2008, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a global organization of astronomers, declared that bodies similar to Pluto would henceforth be called \"plutoids.\" As noted above, for decades Pluto was considered the ninth planet of the solar system. However, in the early 2000s the discovery of similar objects, such as Eris, which is farther from the Sun and almost a third larger than Pluto, forced astronomers to choose between expanding the list of planets--eventually, perhaps, into the dozens or hundreds--or else redefining \"planet\" so that neither Pluto nor Eris qualify. In 2006, despite some sentimental popular outcry, the IAU reclassified Pluto as a \"dwarf planet,\" reducing the official number of planets in the solar system to eight. In 2008, it defined a sub-category of dwarf planets that it called plutoids. Plutoids are more planet-like than other dwarf planets, but are not true \"planets.\" According to the IAU, a plutoid is any body that orbits the Sun at a distance greater than that of Neptune, is large enough for its gravity to pull it into a near-spherical shape, and has not cleared its orbit--that is, which shares its orbital path with an amount of material (such as dust and rocks) at least as massive as itself. As of the IAU's 2008 announcement, Eris and Pluto were the only plutoids yet known.",

The fresh, contemporary sound helped to pave the way for other artists who rode in on the new wave of country music. For three years sisters Janis Gill and Kristine Arnold dominated the charts. They were nominated for Duo of the Year by the Country Music Association and their songs were featured in the 1987 movie Nadine. The second Sweethearts of the Rodeo album sold well, but not as well as the first, and the third, not as well as the second. Their fourth album, according to Arnold, \"was dead when it came out.\" When the sisters found themselves shunned by radio and ignored by their record company, Columbia, they seriously considered calling it quits. Instead, Sweethearts of the Rodeo signed on with independent label Sugar Hill Records and released Rodeo Waltz, a back-to-basics album that had the critics taking a second look. Janis and Kristine Oliver grew up in Manhattan Beach, California, and credit their older brothers' record collection--which included Sonny Terry, John Lee Hooker, Doc Watson, and Bill Monroe--as their musical influence. \"I was just beginning to learn how to play guitar, and listening to those records really had an effect on me,\" Gill recalled to Country Guitar. It wasn't long before Kristine began to accompany her sister on vocals, and by high school they'd formed a folksy bluegrass band. Billing themselves as Sweethearts of the Rodeo, after the classic Byrds album, the sisters spent years on the California club circuit. The influence of such artists as Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and the Eagles became intertwined with the Sweetheart's traditional, down-home melodies to produce a perfect harmony of country and rock. The sisters were also renowned for their stagewear--outlandish homemade outfits with little regard for fashion. They were well received by local audiences, but the big time continued to elude them. Both women married in the early 1980s. Janis wed Vince Gill, a struggling country singer at the time, who by the early 1990s had become one of country's most popular artists. Kristine married musician Leonard Arnold. Both couples started families, and Sweethearts of the Rodeo disbanded in order to meet the demands of parenthood. They moved apart in 1983--the Arnolds moved to Austin, Texas, and the Gills settled in Nashville, Tennessee. The sisters reunited in 1985 when the Arnolds moved to Nashville at Janis's request. \"[Janis] called me ... and said 'can you move? There's no female duo here. The timing is perfect for us,'\" Kristine told The Tennessean. That same year, the twosome won the Wrangler Country Showdown talent contest and signed a contract with Columbia Records. Their 1986 self-titled debut album was a runaway hit, with five singles--including \"Since I Found You\" and \"Midnight Girl/Sunset Town\"--reaching the Top Ten. The duo's earthy music and harmony-laced vocals were praised by fans and critics alike. In Who's Who in New Country Music, Andrew Vaughan noted that the sisters' \"cascading harmonies and tight country rock instrumentation swept hard and clear across country airwaves quickly putting [them] at the head of the Nashville newcomer league.\" Sweethearts of the Rodeo headlined in concerts across the country and were nominated for Duo of the Year by the Country Music Association. In 1987 they provided the soundtrack for the movie Nadine, which starred Jeff Bridges and Kim Bassinger. The suddenness of their popularity and the unprecedented demands on their time put the sisters in an awkward position. The little time they had to spend with their husbands and children was time that their record company felt could be more profitably spent. Over the next two years the sisters juggled their home lives and careers. Their second album, One Time One Night, was warmly received by both critics and fans, but their third album, Buffalo Zone, was given little publicity by the record company. Columbia virtually ignored Sweethearts of the Rodeo's fourth album, Sisters, which was their last recording on that label. \"Radio wasn't playing us anymore,\" Arnold told Robert K. Oermann in The Tennessean. \"The record company wasn't giving us the priority. We got frustrated and thought maybe we ought to quit.\" Both women admitted to \"some tearful conversations\" while deciding what to do next. \"Finally,\" Gill told Oermann, \"we thought, 'gee, are we gonna quit because radio is through with us and turn our backs on nearly 30 years of singing together?'\" They didn't. Instead, Sweethearts of the Rodeo signed on with Sugar Hill Records, home to many of new country's more innovative bands as well as established artists, including Doc Watson, Leon Redbone, Chris Hillman, and Ricky Scaggs. Rodeo Waltz, the duo's 1993 \"comeback\" album, was recorded live in one week (vocals in two days) on a budget of $10,000-- considerably less than the $100,000 Capital had allowed. The 12 songs offer charming acoustic renderings of old and new country, from Johnny Cash's rockabilly \"Get Rhythm\" to the haunting strains of Robbie Robertson's \"Broken Arrow.\" The sisters drew from a well of talented tunesmiths for the album, including Hank Locklin, the Delmore Brothers, Gordon Lightfoot, and Jesse Winchester. Critics were lavish in their praise of Rodeo Waltz. \"The Sweethearts,\" noted Geoffrey Himes of Country Music, \"sing with a kind of old-timey purity and power ... never displayed in all their years on a big label.\" Musician magazine's Holly Gleason lauded the duo's return to their roots, referring to the new songs as \"the turpentine that strips the radio sheen off Sweethearts of the Rodeo.\" Despite the accolades, this time around Gill and Arnold are determined to find a balance between their music and family life. Rather than arenas and amphitheaters, their 1994 schedule included a number of small-venue performances at folk and bluegrass festivals. Sweethearts of the Rodeo have another Sugar Hill release planned for late 1994 and though they hope that Rodeo Waltz receives adequate air time, the sisters are more than comfortable with their less-than-hectic careers. As Gill told Gordon Ely in Virginia's Richmond Times-Dispatch: \"The trade-off in smaller sales is worth the freedom and peace we've found now, a thousand times over.\"</body></html>",

It then appeared on the best-seller lists and attracted the praise of critics in general. Since then it has been reprinted several times and has attained the stature of at least a minor classic, since it is now included in the Modern Standard Author Series (Scribner's). It seems, however, that we won't be quite so vanguardish in recognizing the quality of Mr. Paton's second novel, I believe the critics and the admen are right. First, it is a much more tautly drawn tale. Mr. Paton has tightened up his narrative technique and though his first novel was by no means sprawling, this one has some of the spare muscularity about it that characterizes Graham Greene's technique. Second, At first reading one would be inclined to think that here is just another version of the plot of Graham Greene's There, speaking as a friend, he lays before him the sordidness and danger of the whole situation. When the young man leaves, repentant and straightened out, the young lieutenant drops upon his knees and prays, \"God have mercy upon him.\" But then he goes on—and here is the first hint of tragedy in the story—to pray, \"God have mercy upon me.\" The tragedy quickly and almost inevitably develops. Despite his happy marriage, something has been missing in it. The deep love he feels for his wife has not been fully and completely reciprocated, and as he broods more and more upon the situation, he finds himself with a great loathing and strange fascination drawn toward the Negro girl whom the young man had been pursuing. During the period when his wife and children are off on a short vacation he meets the young Negro girl clandestinely and has an affair with her. The upshot of the whole matter is that the liaison is discovered; the young lieutenant is ruined and his family almost literally destroyed. This is all told through the reminiscences of a maiden aunt who has loved Pieter as her own son and who had realized early in the tragic coil the agony he was going through. It is told in admirable style which catches with real skill the loneliness, the simplicity, the God-fearing reverence of one whose great cross in life was that she had never had a love of her own. This may sound as though the story is a simple account of passion. It may even sound as though it is simply a sordid tale. Let me hasten to say, first of all, that there is a delicacy and chasteness of expression which immediately lifts the book above any suspicion of sensationalism. Let me add that there is a religious tone running through every step of the account which makes it a truly Christian approach to the problem of sin and sinner. But the book is infinitely more than this. It is infinitely more than a mere tale of misguided passion. The great passion that emerges in the pages is the passion of Mr. Paton's own hatred of racial discrimination—which must be the passion of everyone who reads the book, even had he not entertained it before. Mr. Paton's whole thesis is that the criminal law in South Africa has succeeded for generations in making the Negro no more than an animal. It is, he says, \"the iron law that no white man may touch a black woman nor may any white woman be touched by a black man. And to go against this law of a people of rock and stone, in a land of rock and stone, was to be broken and destroyed.\" This terrible philosophy, we are informed in the book, is enshrined in the South African Immorality Act of 1927. If Pieter had had an affair with a white woman, he would, so far as the law is concerned, have been untouched by the horrible penalty which was inflicted upon him. But the mere fact that his offense had been with a Negro woman was enough to hurl him outside the pale of civilized life. It was enough to separate him from wife and children. It was enough to kill his stern, unbending father. All this means that under the law in South Africa the Negroes are looked upon simply as animals. Pieter was not punished for adultery. He was punished because he had overstepped racial boundaries, simply because he had \"defiled\" the sacred Afrikaans blood, sacred because (as they almost blasphemously thought and think) \"as God had chosen them for a people, so did they choose Him for their God, cherishing their separateness that was now His Will.\" This is admirably summed up in the response of the police captain whose duty it had been to break the lieutenant and to inform his family. When the captain had told the story to Pieter's father, the fierce old man struck the arm of his chair and said: The book may in one sense be called propaganda but it is propaganda that is strong with deep and valid emotion. It is propaganda which does not merely uphold a thesis but which portrays human persons being crushed by a thesis. Mr. Paton deserves the gratitude of everyone who would make real to himself the injustice, the dehumanization, which is implicit in every act of racial discrimination, however slight it may be.</body></html>",

Ask students: Who are some famous African American leaders? What makes somebody a leader? Does a leader have to be somebody famous? Can a leader be someone you know? What are some things you can do to become a leader? secretary of state—an official who helps the president of the United States and works with governments in other countries civil rights—the rights of personal freedom guaranteed to every U.S. citizen 1. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court banned segregation on buses. That meant that African American and white people were able to ride the bus together. 2. In September 1957, nine African American students were allowed to go to Central High School, an all-white school in Little Rock, Arkansas. 3. More than 250, 000 people participated in a civil rights march on Washington in 1963 led by Martin Luther King Jr. Read and Share Aloud 4. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. The prize is awarded to a person or a group working for peace. 5. Rosa Parks (1913-2005) is often called the \"Mother of Civil Rights\" because she was one of the most influential women who worked to achieve civil rights. 6. Jackie Robinson (1919-1972) was honored with the 1947 Rookie of the Year award, the highest honor for a new player. Today, the award is named after him. 7. Oprah Winfrey (1954-) was born into a poor family in Kosciusko, Mississippi. Today, the talk show host is known for her generous spirit, collecting millions of dollars for people in need. 8. Condoleezza Rice (1954-) was born in Birmingham, Alabama, during a time when black people were segregated, or separated, from white people in the South. She is also a classical pianist and was a competitive ice skater. 9. George Washington Carver (1865-1943) was honored for his breakthroughs in science. His first home in Diamond, MO was made into a national monument that many people visit today. Ask students: In what ways are you a leader in the classroom? How are you a leader outside of the classroom? Why might it be important to have leaders in the world? Fluency: Give your students the opportunity to read aloud by pairing them with older students. Using some of the suggested resources in this issue, have each student and an older buddy take turns reading aloud. This will develop students' fluency skills while increasing their reading comfort. Read, Write, and Discuss: Read aloud the excerpt of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech in the student edition. Have students write a few sentences about a time when they were treated unfairly and how that made them feel. Make a Book: Have each student draw a picture of someone he or she considers a leader. It can be somebody the student knows personally, somebody famous, or even a fictional character in a favorite book or television program. Have the student fold a large piece of colored construction paper in half to make a booklet. On the front, have the child write the name of the person. Instruct the student to glue or draw a picture of the person on the inside left page. Then, have the student write a paragraph on the right page about why this person is a leader. 3.

How are you a leader outside of the classroom? Why might it be important to have leaders in the world? Fluency: Give your students the opportunity to read aloud by pairing them with older students. Using some of the suggested resources in this issue, have each student and an older buddy take turns reading aloud. This will develop students' fluency skills while increasing their reading comfort. Read, Write, and Discuss: Read aloud the excerpt of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech in the student edition. Have students write a few sentences about a time when they were treated unfairly and how that made them feel. Make a Book: Have each student draw a picture of someone he or she considers a leader. It can be somebody the student knows personally, somebody famous, or even a fictional character in a favorite book or television program. Have the student fold a large piece of colored construction paper in half to make a booklet. On the front, have the child write the name of the person. Instruct the student to glue or draw a picture of the person on the inside left page. Then, have the student write a paragraph on the right page about why this person is a leader. 3.

         "text" : "no title\n\nGeophysicist Seiya Uyeda became an expert on tectonics--the study of Earth's crust and its motions--through his studies of the Japanese island arc. Using this knowledge, he demonstrated the relationship between terrestrial heat flow around Japan and earthquake and volcanic activity. He also developed, with D. Forsyth, a theory explaining the motion of Earth's tectonic plates. Uyeda was born in Tokyo on November 28, 1929, to Seiichi, a government official, and Hatsuo (Okino) Uyeda. He attended the University of Tokyo, majoring in geophysics. He was awarded his bachelor of science in 1952 and his D.Sc. in 1958. In 1952 Uyeda married Mutsuko Kosaka; they have three children, Taro, Makiko, and Naoko. For his doctoral research, Uyeda studied the phenomenon of the self-reversal of magnetism in some rock minerals. This means that the direction of the magnetism of some rocks was exactly opposite of that of Earth's geomagnetic field. The reversal of magnetism in some minerals indicated that in the geological past, Earth's magnetic field had experienced reversals. This area of study was very important at the start of Uyeda's career, as it corresponded with the continental drift theory. Originally proposed in 1912 by Wegener's continental drift theory claimed that all of the current continents were once one large landmass. Although now discounted, that theory was connected to the related theories of sea-floor spreading and plate tectonics. According to plate tectonics, the ocean floor was created at the mid-oceanic trenches, then spread horizontally and finally ended in the deep trenches. Plate tectonics posit that Earth's surface was made of fifteen rigid blocks or plates. The collisions and other interactions of these plates explain the appearance of Earth's crust. Plate tectonics can explain the current appearance of island arcs, the area of study that Uyeda pioneered in association with other scientists. Island arcs are the series of island chains along the northern and western edges of the Pacific. Named for their typical arc shape, they have trenches that are more than six thousand meters (twenty thousand feet) deep, usually lying on the ocean side of each arc. From 1957 to 1964, Uyeda was a research associate at the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo, where he studied the distribution of terrestrial heat flow over the Japanese island arc and its surrounding seas. He found that the flow was low on the ocean side of the arc and high on the continental side; the heat flow in the Sea of Japan was always higher than that of the Japan Trench and the Pacific on the east of Japan. Uyeda's research demonstrated that the distribution of heat flow was related to the distribution of volcanoes and earthquakes. These findings were used as the basis of a theory of typical heat flow for island arcs. Uyeda's research on island arcs led to his discovery, with colleagues, of magnetic lineations in the Pacific Ocean. From this finding, he posited that the Pacific floor had undergone a major northward move sometime in the geological past. Uyeda also co-originated, with Forsyth in 1975, a theory based on a pulling at the trenches of plates that explained the origin of plate motions. Uyeda became an associate professor at the Geophysical Institute in 1964, where he remained until he returned to the Earthquake Research Institute as a professor from 1969 to 1990. In 1990, he became both a professor in the department of marine science and technology at Tokai University in Simizu, Japan, and a professor at the Texas A&M University College Station. Throughout his career, Uyeda also has spent many years as a visiting scientist at prestigious institutions. He has taught at Cambridge and Oxford Universities, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, and the California Institute of Technology. Uyeda has received numerous prizes and honors, including the Tanakadte Prize of the Society of Terrestrial Magnetism and Electricity in 1955, the Agassiz Medal of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1972, the Academy Prize of the Japanese Academy in 1987, and the G. P. Woollard Award of the Geological Society of America in 1989. Uyeda is a foreign associate of the National Academy of Science, an associate member of the Societé Géologique de France, and an honorary fellow of the Geological Society of London.",

         "text" : "no title\n\nIn Frith's musical world, anything that makes a noise that he likes is fair game. \"The history of my playing is a gradual demolition of the guitar over a period of about 15 years.\" The 1986 Guitar Player magazine article that included this quote also called Fred Frith the \"Orville Wright of deconstructive guitaring.\" And not without good reason. Over the course of his career, Frith has banged, pelted, and scraped his electric guitars with a variety of objects and substances that has included rice and barley, scrub brushes, and electronic bows of his own invention. Frith was born on February 17, 1949, in Heathfield, East Sussex, England. He began taking violin lessons at the age of five. Since his father was an accomplished pianist, Frith had access to pianos from an early age as well. In the early 1960s, he switched to guitar. His first band, the Chaperones, was a pop band that covered Ventures songs and others of that ilk. In about 1964, American blues became all the rage among young British musicians, and Frith was carried off by the same blues wave that formed the musical ideas of such rockers as the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton. He also began listening to important guitarists from other idioms, such as jazzer Django Reinhardt. Frith absorbed it all, and soon became proficient in a number of guitar styles. When he moved to Cambridge to go to college, he started playing guitar at folk clubs. He also performed with blues bands, composed music for experimental theater, and even dabbled in flamenco guitar. By the mid-1960s, Frith was listening to every type of music he could get his hands on, and each kind contributed in some small way to the development of his unique sound. A major influence during this time was the philosophy of avant-garde composer John Cage, who wrote of a blurring in the boundary line between music and noise. Frith also became enamored of several branches of Eastern music, and those styles also percolated into his own work. A breakthrough moment came when he disassembled a telephone mouthpiece, and used the little microphone inside of it to amplify the sounds from the \"wrong\" side of his hand on the guitar fingerboard. Frith has been experimenting with the gadgetry of sound ever since. In 1968, while still at Cambridge, Frith teamed up with saxophonist and classmate Tim Hodgekinson to form Henry Cow, an avant-garde rock band formed to explore ideas that were radical both musically and politically. Henry Cow was a fiercely independent entity, refusing to rely on record companies in any way that might force the group to compromise its musical approach. Gradually, a batch of bands with similar views on the music industry and politics in general formed a collective called Rock in Opposition, with Henry Cow at its core. Henry Cow lasted for ten years, during which time the group recorded six albums (starting with Leg End in 1973), performed hundreds of concerts, and influenced a generation of cutting edge rockers in Europe. Around the time that Henry Cow released its second album, 1974's Unrest, Frith made the first of his solo improvisational records. Titled simply Guitar Solos, the album featured a number of technical innovations that have been much copied since then. One of the trademark techniques featured on the album is the \"hammering on\" method using both hands on the fingerboard side of the guitar, a move that has become a staple of guitar rockers in the Eddie Van Halen mold. Frith recorded two more albums in the Guitar Solos series during the 1970s, and pieces from those recordings were rereleased on CD in 1991. These recordings featured collaborations with other free-form experts, including Derek Bailey, Eugene Chadbourne, and Hans Reichel. As Henry Cow began to fall apart in the late 1970s, Frith launched a splinter project with vocalist Dagmar Krause and percussionist Chris Cutler called the Art Bears. Unlike Henry Cow, the Art Bears were not a live performing entity. The Art Bears' three LPs reflected a politically-charged, if rather dim, world view. As the 1970s drew to a close, Frith moved to New York, where he quickly recorded what many consider to be his masterpiece, the solo album Gravity, in 1979. In sharp contrast to his work with the Art Bears, the mood of Gravity is utterly uplifting. Its material is lifted from the dance music of many different cultures from around the world. Frith jointed forces with Bill Laswell (co-founder of the band Material) and drummer Fred Maher in 1980 to form a group called Massacre, a raucously loud and energetic band tailor-made for the surging New York downtown club scene. Massacre lasted only a couple of years, after which Frith put together another loud trio, Skeleton Crew, with Tom Cora and Zeena Parkins. Meanwhile, Frith was collaborating and guesting with every cutting-edge musician in sight, including appearances on recordings by Brian Eno, the Violent Femmes, the Residents, John Zorn, and too many others to list. He also followed up Gravity with the solo efforts Speechless (1981) and Cheap at Half the Price (1983). As the 1980s continued, Frith's prepared guitars, which are played lying on a table (the guitar, not the player), began to resemble guitars less and less, until he eventually stopped calling them guitars. In 1988 he released another solo album, The Technology of Tears. He also began to compose more music for film, theater, and dance, as well as pieces to be played by other musicians. A 1991 documentary, Step Across the Border, chronicled Frith's career beginning with Massacre, and Frith also released a soundtrack CD of the same title. In the early 1990s, Frith moved to California, although he maintained a strong New York connection through his frequent collaborations with the equally prolific John Zorn. He was a regular performer with Zorn's band Naked City. Keep the Dog is another band with which Frith was active. At some point in the 1990s Frith moved his permanent base back to Europe, where experimental music has always been received in a friendlier manner. In 1996 he released Allies--Music for Dance, vol. 2 on Switzerland's RecRec label. Although he remains as innovative as ever in his approach to sound, Frith has outgrown his former reputation as a noise rocker who bashes hisguitar with objects; he is now generally regarded as a more or less serious avant-garde composer. In the case of Fred Frith, however, such labels are meaningless. It's only the noise that counts.",

He also followed up Gravity with the solo efforts Speechless (1981) and Cheap at Half the Price (1983). As the 1980s continued, Frith's prepared guitars, which are played lying on a table (the guitar, not the player), began to resemble guitars less and less, until he eventually stopped calling them guitars. In 1988 he released another solo album, The Technology of Tears. He also began to compose more music for film, theater, and dance, as well as pieces to be played by other musicians. A 1991 documentary, Step Across the Border, chronicled Frith's career beginning with Massacre, and Frith also released a soundtrack CD of the same title. In the early 1990s, Frith moved to California, although he maintained a strong New York connection through his frequent collaborations with the equally prolific John Zorn. He was a regular performer with Zorn's band Naked City. Keep the Dog is another band with which Frith was active. At some point in the 1990s Frith moved his permanent base back to Europe, where experimental music has always been received in a friendlier manner. In 1996 he released Allies--Music for Dance, vol. 2 on Switzerland's RecRec label. Although he remains as innovative as ever in his approach to sound, Frith has outgrown his former reputation as a noise rocker who bashes hisguitar with objects; he is now generally regarded as a more or less serious avant-garde composer. In the case of Fred Frith, however, such labels are meaningless. It's only the noise that counts.</body></html>"

While groups throughout history had supported birth control and abortion, it was not until John Rock (1890-1984), Gregory Pincus (1903-1967), and others developed the pill that the era began. In 1961, American obstetrician and gynecologist Jack Lippes (1924-) devised a flexible plastic intrauterine device (IUD) that ushered in an era of effectiveness as well as some controversy. A defective IUD, termed the Dalkon Shield, clouded the IUD with concerns for safety. Implants were developed around 1990 and are still being researched. The advent of birth control coincided with a period in history of social unrest and the origin of many movements against establishment ideas. The rise of the feminist movement and of equal rights for women was supported by those who sought freedom from being controlled by the reproductive cycle. The whole question of reproductive freedom assisted by legal decisions like In past centuries, even educated women knew very little about the human body and even less about reproduction. Midwives who had served throughout history lost their jobs as male-dominated specialists became obstetricians. In the early 1800s, groups of drug- and device-peddlers profited from women's desires for family control. Campaigns to curb the practices, along with the Victorian ideas that these things were wrong and should not be addressed, succeeded in passing groups of laws that criminalized abortion and even contraception information. American politician Anthony Comstock (1844-1915) formed a Committee for the Suppression of Vice and fought to get laws passed in 1873 that prohibited making, transporting, and disseminating \"obscene, lewd, and lascivious matter.\" The laws affected all devices and information for preventing conception. Nonetheless, women--at least in the Western world--did make progress in terms of gaining access to information about contraception. In Great Britain physician Marie Stopes (1888-1958) opened the first birth control clinic in 1921 to teach working class women about how to prevent unwanted pregnancies. American nurse Margaret Sanger (1883-1966), concerned with how low-income women of New York were devastated by self-induced abortions and unwanted pregnancies, opened up a store-front clinic in 1916. Sanger collided head-on with the groups supporting the Comstock laws but persisted in spite of arrests and threats. Her crusade, which began in 1916, gave birth to the group Planned Parenthood and would be instrumental in encouraging the development of the birth control pill, as well as the legal decisions relating to abortions. Sanger in fact coined the term birth control. In October 1950, a wealthy seventy-one-year-old widow named American biologist and philanthropist Katherine McCormick (1875-1967), heir of the fortune of American inventor Cyrus McCormick (1809-1884), inventor of the reaper, wrote a letter to Margaret Sanger. For years, Sanger had been fighting for the right to disseminate information and had had some success in fighting the Comstock laws. McCormick told Sanger of her interest in contraceptive research and willingness to support the venture financially. American biologist Dr. Gregory Pincus (1903-1967), director of the Worcester Foundation of Experimental Biology, was studying the early development of mammalian eggs. The two women met Pincus by chance and revealed their vision of a method of birth control, a contraceptive that could be \"swallowed like an aspirin.\" The search for such a pill would follow a dramatic path. American chemist Russell Marker (1902-1995) became very interested in the chemical composition of steroids as a possibility for treating arthritis, and he happened to find a corticosteroid termed progesterone in the urine of pregnant women. Marker hit upon the idea of finding a plant with the steroid, and after a worldwide search he found the cabeza de nigra, a yucca-like yam in Mexico. Discouraged about setting up production in Mexico, Marker destroyed all his papers and disappeared in Mexico in 1949. Back in Massachusetts, Pincus accepted the challenge of finding that perfect pill. He met John Rock (1890-1984), an American scientist working on the opposite problem of fertility. The two teamed up to search for Marker, whose steroid of which they had heard. After several months, they found him and persuaded him to let them synthesize the molecule. After several other intriguing battles, they succeeded in making the pill. When they realized there would be a struggle for trials in the U.S., they got permission to clinically test in Puerto Rico and Haiti. The pill proved very effective. The most difficult trials were the religious and political struggles that would follow. Oral hormones are synthesized compounds of the natural hormones estrogen and progesterone. Early in the menstrual cycle, the growth lining (endometrium) of the uterus is controlled by estrogen. Progesterone, made in great quantities in the second half of the cycle, changes the lining of the uterus and causes mucus in the lower part of the reproductive tract to resist sperm. Both of these hormones act on the pituitary glands at the base of the brain. This gland then secretes hormones termed gonadatrophins that regulate the estrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries. Most oral contraceptives have both estrogen and progesterone. When one takes the pill, the presence of the hormones mimics a normal pregnancy and prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries. Different pharmaceutical companies produce pills with varying formulations. A few pills have only a type of progesterone that causes changes in the mucus lining that allows sperm to swim toward the uterus. Several years after the inception, the oral contraceptive was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1960. The revolution brought by the pill not only enabled women to plan a family but to plan a life and career. The birth control pill was one of the wonders of scientific medicine of the 1960s and 1970s. However, as the years passed, some studies linked use with certain forms of cancer and other problems. Another advance in birth control is the injectable hormone depot mednoxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). DMPA keeps the ovaries from releasing eggs to implant. A shot is needed every twelve weeks. The contraceptive named Depo-Provera is registered in some countries, but the U.S. FDA rejected it in 1974, 1978, and 1984. The side effects and idea of a shot has not made it very popular; however, it became available in Planned Parenthood clinics. Depo-Provera was finally approved for use in the U.S. in 1992. Depo-subQ Provera 104 was developed as a lower dose version of the original Depo-Provera and was approved for contraceptive use in the U.S. in 2004. IUDs have been used in different forms throughout history to prevent pregnancy. They were invented in the nineteenth century but only became widespread in the late 1950s. Lippes designed a flexible plastic device that was termed the Lippes loop. IUDs, available only by prescription, come in varieties of shapes and are fitted into the uterus with a string that remains through the opening in the cervix. The string functions to check the position of the IUD as well as to aid in the removal of the device. IUDs work primarily by preventing fertilization of the egg by affecting the way the egg or sperm move. In 1970 Chilean physician Jaime Zipper added copper (Cu) to the plastic device, which caused less bleeding and was more effective. However, IUDs were under great scrutiny. The Dalkon Shield was an IUD that sparked controversy because physical problems and infections became prevalent. Questions about the Dalkon Shield reflected on even those devices that were safe. Lawsuits that eventually caused the company A.H. Robbins to go bankrupt also gave all IUDs a bad name. By 1998 only four companies were manufacturing IUDs, and only two types were available in the U.S. One type contains copper and could be left in place for ten years. Another continuously released a small amount of the hormone progestin and must be replaced every year. A happening of the late twentieth century was the rise of litigation and prosecution for defective products. When women began to sue A.H. Robbins, the cost of litigation overwhelmed the IUD market with spillover lawsuits. For example, although the Searle CU-7 IUD was never determined defective, it drew more than two thousand lawsuits. In the 1990s a device termed the Norplant implant began to attract attention. Norplant was approved by the FDA in 1990. With this device, the physician inserts six thin flexible plastic rods under the skin in the upper arm. Each capsule has a powdered crystal of the hormone levonorgestrol, a progestin (synthetic version of progesterone). By releasing a small amount, the drug keeps the ovaries from releasing eggs and thickens cervical mucus. Norplant is an effective method of protecting against unwanted pregnancy for five years. Litigation, however, took its toll. The first year sales were $141 million. When lawsuits entered the picture, sales dropped to $3.7 million the next year. Marketing and sales of Norplant was discontinued in the U.S. in 2002. Jadelle, Norplant's successor, was approved by the FDA in 1996 for three years maximum use and reexamined and approved for five years in 2002, but is not available in the U.S. Implanon, a single rod upper arm implant containing the synthetic progestin etonogestrel, was approved for use in the U.S. for up to three years by the FDA in 2006. Two other types of hormonal birth control have been developed in the twenty-first century: the contraceptive patch and the vaginal ring. The patch (Orthro Evra and Evra) is placed on the abdomen and releases both estrogen and progestin to prevent release of an egg from the ovaries and thicken the cervical mucus. The patch is applied once a week for three weeks with no patch application for the fourth week. The vaginal ring (NuvaRing) prevents pregnancy by releasing estrogen and progestin similar to the patch. The flexible ring is placed into the vagina for three weeks and then removed for the fourth week. Both the patch and the vaginal ring were approved for contraceptive use in the U.S. by the FDA in 2001. A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1973, The story of RU-486, a French abortion pill, is full of subterfuge and intrigue. The drug offers women a simple and effective way to end pregnancy. In 1982 Group Roussel Uclaf, a subsidiary of Hoechst, Germany, stunned the world with the announcement of the creation of an abortion pill. As the uterus prepares for pregnancy, it receives progesterone by special receptors, but RU-486 binds to the receiving cells and blocks the hormones. Because the uterine lining does not get the hormone, it sloughs off, taking the embryo with it. In 1987 trials indicated a success rate of 95 percent when used with a second drug. Like a miscarriage, it produced heavy bleeding, which could last up to two weeks; yet, some scientists stated it was much safer than mechanical abortion. In 1988, in response to serious pressure from anti-abortion advocates, Roussel announced it would no longer market RU-486. Only forty-eight hours later, the French government ordered the company to reverse the position. In 1992, ten years after the discovery, Roussel announced it would not seek to market the drug in the United States because of American anti-abortion forces but would sell only in France, Britain, and Sweden. The Chinese created their own version in 1988 in response to the one child policy--a law mandating that married couples could have no more than one child. When Bill Clinton (1946-) became U.S. president in 1993, the FDA sought to have Hoechst market RU-486 in the United States, but the company decided against it and instead donated the rights to the pill to the Population Council, a non-profit research group. The group now had the patent but no one to market it. In 1992 another non-profit group, Abortion Rights Mobilization (ARM), growing tired of Hoechst and the Population Council, found a little-known law that allowed researchers to copy and distribute the drug as long as it was not for profit. Lawrence Lader, a seventy-eight-year-old New York writer and head of the group, built a warehouse in Westchester. The group hired a scientist to produce a copy and distributed it through an underground organization. ARM found a manufacturer (although the name is not revealed) and distributes it to clinics in several cities. RU-486, which is referred to as the Early Option Pill, was approved by the FDA for distribution in the U.S. in 2000. Another abortion drug, methotrexate (MTX), stops the cells of the embryo from dividing. Like RU-486, it is given with a second drug, misoprostrol. MTX has not been approved by the FDA for abortion, but is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and as a chemotherapy drug. Societal forces related to birth control are complex. The interplay of birth control advocates, scientists, churches, and other conservative groups, feminists, drug companies, the courts, trial lawyers, the government, consumers, and consumer advocates have made contraception and abortion issues as controversial as ever as the twenty-first century continues.</body></html>",

When they realized there would be a struggle for trials in the U.S., they got permission to clinically test in Puerto Rico and Haiti. The pill proved very effective. The most difficult trials were the religious and political struggles that would follow. Oral hormones are synthesized compounds of the natural hormones estrogen and progesterone. Early in the menstrual cycle, the growth lining (endometrium) of the uterus is controlled by estrogen. Progesterone, made in great quantities in the second half of the cycle, changes the lining of the uterus and causes mucus in the lower part of the reproductive tract to resist sperm. Both of these hormones act on the pituitary glands at the base of the brain. This gland then secretes hormones termed gonadatrophins that regulate the estrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries. Most oral contraceptives have both estrogen and progesterone. When one takes the pill, the presence of the hormones mimics a normal pregnancy and prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries. Different pharmaceutical companies produce pills with varying formulations. A few pills have only a type of progesterone that causes changes in the mucus lining that allows sperm to swim toward the uterus. Several years after the inception, the oral contraceptive was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1960. The revolution brought by the pill not only enabled women to plan a family but to plan a life and career. The birth control pill was one of the wonders of scientific medicine of the 1960s and 1970s. However, as the years passed, some studies linked use with certain forms of cancer and other problems. Another advance in birth control is the injectable hormone depot mednoxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). DMPA keeps the ovaries from releasing eggs to implant. A shot is needed every twelve weeks. The contraceptive named Depo-Provera is registered in some countries, but the U.S. FDA rejected it in 1974, 1978, and 1984. The side effects and idea of a shot has not made it very popular; however, it became available in Planned Parenthood clinics. Depo-Provera was finally approved for use in the U.S. in 1992. Depo-subQ Provera 104 was developed as a lower dose version of the original Depo-Provera and was approved for contraceptive use in the U.S. in 2004. IUDs have been used in different forms throughout history to prevent pregnancy. They were invented in the nineteenth century but only became widespread in the late 1950s. Lippes designed a flexible plastic device that was termed the Lippes loop. IUDs, available only by prescription, come in varieties of shapes and are fitted into the uterus with a string that remains through the opening in the cervix. The string functions to check the position of the IUD as well as to aid in the removal of the device. IUDs work primarily by preventing fertilization of the egg by affecting the way the egg or sperm move. In 1970 Chilean physician Jaime Zipper added copper (Cu) to the plastic device, which caused less bleeding and was more effective. However, IUDs were under great scrutiny. The Dalkon Shield was an IUD that sparked controversy because physical problems and infections became prevalent. Questions about the Dalkon Shield reflected on even those devices that were safe. Lawsuits that eventually caused the company A.H. Robbins to go bankrupt also gave all IUDs a bad name. By 1998 only four companies were manufacturing IUDs, and only two types were available in the U.S. One type contains copper and could be left in place for ten years. Another continuously released a small amount of the hormone progestin and must be replaced every year. A happening of the late twentieth century was the rise of litigation and prosecution for defective products. When women began to sue A.H. Robbins, the cost of litigation overwhelmed the IUD market with spillover lawsuits. For example, although the Searle CU-7 IUD was never determined defective, it drew more than two thousand lawsuits. In the 1990s a device termed the Norplant implant began to attract attention. Norplant was approved by the FDA in 1990. With this device, the physician inserts six thin flexible plastic rods under the skin in the upper arm. Each capsule has a powdered crystal of the hormone levonorgestrol, a progestin (synthetic version of progesterone). By releasing a small amount, the drug keeps the ovaries from releasing eggs and thickens cervical mucus. Norplant is an effective method of protecting against unwanted pregnancy for five years. Litigation, however, took its toll. The first year sales were $141 million. When lawsuits entered the picture, sales dropped to $3.7 million the next year. Marketing and sales of Norplant was discontinued in the U.S. in 2002. Jadelle, Norplant's successor, was approved by the FDA in 1996 for three years maximum use and reexamined and approved for five years in 2002, but is not available in the U.S. Implanon, a single rod upper arm implant containing the synthetic progestin etonogestrel, was approved for use in the U.S. for up to three years by the FDA in 2006. Two other types of hormonal birth control have been developed in the twenty-first century: the contraceptive patch and the vaginal ring. The patch (Orthro Evra and Evra) is placed on the abdomen and releases both estrogen and progestin to prevent release of an egg from the ovaries and thicken the cervical mucus. The patch is applied once a week for three weeks with no patch application for the fourth week. The vaginal ring (NuvaRing) prevents pregnancy by releasing estrogen and progestin similar to the patch. The flexible ring is placed into the vagina for three weeks and then removed for the fourth week. Both the patch and the vaginal ring were approved for contraceptive use in the U.S. by the FDA in 2001. A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1973, The story of RU-486, a French abortion pill, is full of subterfuge and intrigue. The drug offers women a simple and effective way to end pregnancy. In 1982 Group Roussel Uclaf, a subsidiary of Hoechst, Germany, stunned the world with the announcement of the creation of an abortion pill. As the uterus prepares for pregnancy, it receives progesterone by special receptors, but RU-486 binds to the receiving cells and blocks the hormones. Because the uterine lining does not get the hormone, it sloughs off, taking the embryo with it. In 1987 trials indicated a success rate of 95 percent when used with a second drug. Like a miscarriage, it produced heavy bleeding, which could last up to two weeks; yet, some scientists stated it was much safer than mechanical abortion. In 1988, in response to serious pressure from anti-abortion advocates, Roussel announced it would no longer market RU-486. Only forty-eight hours later, the French government ordered the company to reverse the position. In 1992, ten years after the discovery, Roussel announced it would not seek to market the drug in the United States because of American anti-abortion forces but would sell only in France, Britain, and Sweden. The Chinese created their own version in 1988 in response to the one child policy--a law mandating that married couples could have no more than one child. When Bill Clinton (1946-) became U.S. president in 1993, the FDA sought to have Hoechst market RU-486 in the United States, but the company decided against it and instead donated the rights to the pill to the Population Council, a non-profit research group. The group now had the patent but no one to market it. In 1992 another non-profit group, Abortion Rights Mobilization (ARM), growing tired of Hoechst and the Population Council, found a little-known law that allowed researchers to copy and distribute the drug as long as it was not for profit. Lawrence Lader, a seventy-eight-year-old New York writer and head of the group, built a warehouse in Westchester. The group hired a scientist to produce a copy and distributed it through an underground organization. ARM found a manufacturer (although the name is not revealed) and distributes it to clinics in several cities. RU-486, which is referred to as the Early Option Pill, was approved by the FDA for distribution in the U.S. in 2000. Another abortion drug, methotrexate (MTX), stops the cells of the embryo from dividing. Like RU-486, it is given with a second drug, misoprostrol. MTX has not been approved by the FDA for abortion, but is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and as a chemotherapy drug. Societal forces related to birth control are complex. The interplay of birth control advocates, scientists, churches, and other conservative groups, feminists, drug companies, the courts, trial lawyers, the government, consumers, and consumer advocates have made contraception and abortion issues as controversial as ever as the twenty-first century continues.",

After decades of lingering in his shadow, she finally achieved a measure of fame in 2000 with a critically acclaimed album of duets performed with Irish roc ker Van Morrison. Living a life every bit as tumultuous as her piano-thumping brother's, Lewis has toured the world repeatedly, married eight times, nearly died from drug overdoses, and has fought the ongoing battle of family-versus-career. In the course of her musical career she has written and sung a variety of music, some good and some comically bad. Her style, which has embraced hard-core honky-tonk music, 1950s rock'n'roll, and touches of Memphis soul, has made her a favorite in Europe. Like her brother Jerry Lee, Linda Gail Lewis soaked up the sounds of hillbilly music and rhythm and blues in the rural areas of Ferriday and Black River, Louisiana. Although the Lewis family was poor, they always had enough to eat because of father Elmo Lewis's skill at farming. When Jerry Lee began to score hits with \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" and \"Great Balls of Fire\" in 1957, he singlehandedly lifted the family from dire poverty to a life of relative ease. \"Jerry shared everything he had with us,\" Linda Gail remarked in a personal interview. \"He'd call my mama up and say, 'Mama, I want you and daddy and Frankie Jean and Linda Gail to have everything that I have.' And we did!. ... I don't know how many people would say that. He meant it too.\" Linda Gail's chief inspiration was Jerry Lee, but later, as the era of rock'n'roll came into play, she also tuned into the sounds of Brenda Lee, Patsy Cl ine, and Lavern Baker. Like her famed elder brother, she was married many times, and her first marriages were at ages 14 and 15. Lewis's official recording debut came when she performed as Jerry Lee's duet partner for Sun Records in 1963, where her defiantly off-key vocals turned their rendition of George Jones's \"Seasons Of My Heart\" into one of the worst records ever made. \"I've gotten a lot of criticism for the vocals I did early on,\" Linda Gail said in an interview. \"I hate to say it was a mistake to do it, because it is a part of history and something I remember in a fond way, but I wish I could've sung that song a little bit better.\" As a teenager Lewis joined her brother on the road, playing in numerous tank towns and dives. Yet according to Lewis, her brother shielded her from the late night parties and exploits that were common to a touring rock'n'roll band. \"Oh yeah, he did take care of me,\" she remarked. \"He protected me.... I knew that after the gigs I wasn't welcome to be at these parties. I knew I was just going to be watching the late, late show if I was lucky enough for one to be on in my motel room.\" The near-constant touring provided Lewis with valuable experience and a chance to sharpen her vocal skills, and resulted in a unique opportunity---a steady gig with the road company of ABC-TV's mid-1960s teenfest Lewis's first solo release, the ABC-Paramount single \"Small Red Diary,\" sank into obscurity, as did a lone single for Columbia, a remake of LaVern Baker's \"Jim Dandy.\" Meanwhile, Lewis made several duet appearances on her bro ther's b-sides and albums for Smash records. It was only after Jerry Lee mounted his late-1960s comeback via country music that Lewis was finally able to ride his coattails onto the charts. Recording with her brother, she scored her lone top ten c ountry hit with a version of Carl and Pearl Butler's \"Don't Let Me Cross Over. \" A rousing duet remake of Chuck Berry's \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" a staple of her act, followed it onto the lower chart regions. The Lewis duo's 1969 Smash LP In addition to composing material for her brother's top-selling Smash and Mercury discs, Lewis also garnered an ASCAP award for her song \"Smile, Somebody Loves You,\" her only solo top 40 country hit. She was growing artistically, but her label did n ot seem to notice. \"Nobody was really serious about my career,\" declared Lewis. The best pure country singles of her career, 1970's \"Before The Snow Flies,\" which featured a rare appearance by brother Jerry Lee on rhythm guitar, and 1973's \"I Wanna Be a Sensuous Woman,\" which she debuted on ABC-TV's While her recording career languished, Lewis toured almost non-stop as part of her brother's show. She twice married and divorced his best friend and road manager, Cecil Harrelson, and then married Jerry Lee's guitarist/fiddle player Ke nny Lovelace, with whom she often wrote songs. The constant touring wreaked havoc on her relationship with her two children, and her drug use took a toll on her health. The drugs were prescribed by several physicians, none of whom knew she was under trea tment by others. Lewis recalled that a mistake may have saved her life. \"I slipped up by calling one doctor who found out about the other doctors---about three or four of 'em were giving me these things.\" Lewis was hospitalized as a res ult of her drug habit, and Jerry Lee picked up the tab, but her efforts to stay clean and sober alienated her from her brother. By 1977 she had had enough---she quit the act, married a man outside the music industry and started a new family. After a hiatus of nearly ten years, Lewis returned to music in the late 1980s, touring briefly with Jerry Lee before belatedly going solo at age 39. Realizing that her brother's piano was an important facet of her public identity, Lewis taught herse lf to pound the keys in his style. The return to show business ended her marriage to her sixth husband and threw her into the arms of Robert Ellis (aka Bobby Memphis), a professional Elvis impersonator. The two played clubs throughout the mid-South befor e they bitterly parted company, and she then married former Stax promotion man Eddie Braddock. Lewis finally caught a career break when the New Rose label in France released Lewis made her biggest splash outside the recording studio when she entertainingly chronicled her years on the road in a 1998 autobiography titled The attention garnered by the book led to Lewis's self-titled 1999 album on Sire. Boasting higher production values than her previous discs, and including songs written by Motown legend Smokey Robinson, Sam Phillips's son Jerry Phillips, and Nashville firebrand Tim Krekkal, the album represented Lewis's best solo work. However, the disc has yet to be released in America. \"I don't know if they're ever going to release it in the states,\" said Lewis. Lewis's biggest career boost came via legendary Irish rocker Van Morrison. Fittingly, Lewis met Morrison at a Jerry Lee Lewis convention in England. After a soundcheck jam session, Morrison proposed the collaboration, which resulted in the 200 0 Pointblank/Virgin album Splitting her time between residences in Wales and Big Sandy, Tennessee, Lewis has continued to play European rock revival venues. In 2003 she released Although Lewis has not attained major success as a solo act, she has continued to savor opportunities to make fresh music. \"It should be an inspiration to a lot of women my age,\" she declared, \"because I am fifty-three and I';m still learning, still growing as a talent. Today I am a hundred times better songwriter than I was a year ago. I'm ten times a better singer than I was a year ago. I'm willing to say that I can still learn something and I can still grow!\"</body></html>",

Then again, Rockapella is an unusual group. Making music solely with the voices of its five members, the group has consistently amazed and delighted audiences with songs ranging from doo-wop to updated Christmas carols. Wildly popular in Japan and with a fan base that stretches from six-year-olds to their grandparents in North America, Rockapella has survived numerous personnel changes and musical trends to become one of the most recognized a cappella groups since the days of the barbershop quartet. Rockapella had its origins in the High Jinks, a male chorus that performed around campus at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Like many college a cappella groups, the High Jinks specialized in traditional songs along with humorous parodies and some original material. In the mid-1980s, two former singers with the High Jinks, Sean Altman and Elliott Kerman, decided to form an a cappella group when they found themselves in New York City after their graduation from Brown. They recruited some other recent alumni to the new group, but getting the group off the ground was a difficult process as several members came and went during Rockapella's first few years. Altman also sang with his rock band, Blind Dates, while Kerman sang in jazz clubs; some of the other members fit their Rockapella duties into their graduate school schedules or full-time professional careers. As Altman recalled in an interview with the Contemporary A Cappella Society online, \"In the early years of the group, we had members who were, for example, 75% computer programmer/25% Rockapella member.... Each of us has worked jobs outside the group at times, in order to pay the rent.\" In 1985 and 1986, most of Rockapella's performances took place on the New York City streets where they often sang outside of an ice cream shop collecting quarters. According to band legend, they usually spent the proceeds on dinner at a local Chinese restaurant, paying for the meal entirely with change they had collected on the street. By 1987, however, Rockapella found more lucrative work at weddings, bar mitzvahs, and corporate retreats throughout the New York City region, typically performing about 20 times a month. The band also began to change its repertoire, adding more a cappella arrangements of pop songs along with more traditional fare. In 1988, Rockapella got its first big break when it appeared on the Rockapella's second big break came in 1990 while the band was still playing most of its dates around New York City's music and comedy clubs. A demo tape of the group's rendition of the calypso standard \"Zombie Jamboree\" secured the band a place on a Public Broadcasting System (PBS) special produced by film director Spike Lee called By the end of 1990, Rockapella had settled on a permanent lineup. Along with Leonard and founding members Altman and Kerman, Barry Carl had become the band's bass vocalist in 1989. After completing his degree in music at the Juilliard School, Carl had sung for four years with the New York City Opera. In 1995, after appearing with the group on a number of As a popular children's show on PBS from 1991 to 1996, Rockapella also recorded backing tracks for two national ad campaigns--a television commercial for Folger's Coffee and a radio ad for the Almond Joy candy bar--that increased its exposure in the United States. Given the demanding schedule of The group's second album on J-Bird, Rockapella also released a Christmas album in 2000 and followed it up with a concert album and accompanying PBS television special in 2001.

Y., across the Hudson from West Point, the son of Sylvanus Warren, a close personal friend of Washington Irving and a prominent citizen of Putnam County. Fourth of twelve children, the lad was named for Gouverneur Kemble [ The opening of the Civil War found him still teaching at West Point, but on May 14, 1861, he became lieutenant-colonel of the 5th New York Volunteers, seeing action at Big Bethel Church, June 10, and subsequently aiding in the construction of defenses around Baltimore and Washington. He was promoted colonel of his regiment Aug. 31, and captain of topographical engineers, United States Army, Sept. 9. In the Peninsular campaign of 1862 he was engaged in the siege of Yorktown and commanded a brigade at Pamunky River and Hanover Court House (May 26, 27). He was wounded at Gaines's Mill, June 27, and brevetted lieutenant-colonel, United States Army, for gallant and meritorious service in that battle. Four days later he commanded the force that repulsed Wise's division at Malvern Hill, and the next day participated in the engagement at Harrison's Landing. He took part in the second battle of Bull Run and the skirmish at Centerville (Aug. 30, Sept. 1, 1862), and commanded a brigade in the Maryland campaign and its sequel, from Antietam to Falmouth, Va. (September-November 1862). Promoted brigadier-general of volunteers, Sept. 26, he served at the battle of Fredericksburg in December. As chief topographical engineer of the Army of the Potomac from Feb. 4, 1863, he saw action in May at Orange Pike, Marye Heights, and Salem. He was promoted major-general of volunteers June 3, 1863, and served as chief engineer, Army of the Potomac, from June 8 to Aug. 12, 1863. It was at Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863) that he rendered his most distinguished service. On the second day of that vital struggle, sent at his own suggestion by Meade to examine the Union left, he discovered that Little Round Top, the commanding position, was undefended except for a few signalers. He perceived Longstreet's threat and, intercepting some of Sickles' supports and Sykes's troops on the Peach Orchard road, practically commandeered them for the defense of the hill, just in time to keep Little Round Top from falling into the hands of the Confederates. Had this critical point been taken by Longstreet, it is agreed that the whole Union army would have been forced back in disorder and the day lost. Warren was brevetted colonel, United States Army, for his services in this battle, and in 1888 a bronze statue of him was erected to mark the spot where his alertness and energy came into play. Despite a wound received during the defense of Little Round Top, he continued in action, and was subsequently in temporary command of the II Corps from Aug. 12, 1863, to Mar. 24, 1864, participating in a number of engagements, notably that at Bristoe Station. He was placed regularly in command of the V Corps, Mar. 24, 1864, and with this corps participated in the actions of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and other engagements, as well as the various assaults on Petersburg. He was promoted major, United States Army, June 25, 1864, and brevetted major-general, United States Army, Mar. 13, 1865. At Five Forks, Apr. 1, 1865, the last decisive battle of the war, his corps, after conflicting orders, arrived with dispatch on the flank of the Confederates and offered to the cavalry's hard-pressed troops the signal aid that clinched the victory, but to the astonishment of his subordinates and others engaged in that critical action, he was summarily relieved of his command by Sheridan, who had been given authority by General Grant. Transferred to command the defenses of Petersburg and the Southside Railroad, he served here during April and the first half of May, then commanded the Department of Mississippi, May 14-30, 1865. On May 27 he resigned his volunteer commission and reverted to the status of major of engineers, United States Army. During the later sixties he prepared maps and reports of his campaigns and elaborated for publication the results of some of his early explorations. He served as member of the board of engineers to examine the canal at Washington, D. C., as superintending engineer of surveys and improvements of the upper Mississippi, and as member of the commission to examine the Union Pacific Railroad and telegraph lines. He was also in charge of the survey of the battlefield of Gettysburg. For almost a year, in 1869-70, he supervised the building of the Rock Island bridge across the Mississippi, and there through exposure and over-exertion received the impairment to his health which ultimately caused his death. He continued for twelve years more, however, in the river-and-harbor work of the Corps of Engineers--in the upper Mississippi Valley, along the Atlantic Coast, and in the Great Lakes. On Oct. 10, 1878, he was made a member of the advisory council of the Harbor Commission of Rhode Island, and on Mar. 4, 1879, he was promoted a lieutenant-colonel of engineers. Throughout this period he made repeated requests for a board of inquiry to examine into the causes of his ignominious relief at Five Forks, but since the authorities implicated were then in power, his request was not granted until December 1879. The court then appointed not only fully exonerated and applauded him, but cast reflections upon the manner of his relief. Ironically, however, the findings vindicating him were not published until three months after his death. Among Warren's published writings were: \"Examination of Reports of Various Routes,\" with Capt. A. A. Humphreys, in Warren was a firm friend, a generous enemy, gentle, sensitive, kind, and staunch. He was passionately fond of flowers. After the death of his father in 1859, he assumed much of the responsibility for the younger members of the family, whose welfare he guarded faithfully and tenderly. On June 17, 1863, he married Emily Forbes Chase of Baltimore, by whom he had a son and a daughter; two years later his sister Emily married his former aide, Washington A. Roebling [ [E. G.

         "text" : "no title\n\nBursting onto the pop scene in 1994 with its acclaimed Everybody's Got One album, Echobelly has been a prominent force in the British musical invasion of the 1990s. Although often compared to Blondie and obviously influenced by Morrissey, who himself is a big fan of the group, Echobelly has carved out its own unique place with extremely tuneful melodies that cascade between exuberant optimism and vehement attacks against oppression, bigotry, and alienation in the modern world. As was noted by Jori Wiederhorn in a 1995 issue of Rolling Stone, \"Echobelly's music is a striking paradox, an unlikely melange of sweet, spiky melodies and bleak, shadowy image.\" Wiederhorn added that the group members \"play with a passion and power well beyond their two years as a band.\" One of the hallmarks of Echobelly is their apparent joy in their music, even when dealing with less than joyous subjects. \"Ms. Madan's clear, cheerful voice sounds optimistic even when she's telling people to go away,\" wrote Jon Pareles in the New York Times about a 1995 performance at Irving Plaza in New York City. Devon Jackson of Harper's Bazaar added that the group is \"Powerful and spirited, but not at all strident or preachy when railing against injustice, racism, or oppression.\" The group also has a distinctive multicultural presence with its mix of personnel that includes an Indian-born vocalist, a Swedish guitarist, and a black lesbian guitarist. Despite the melting pot nature of the band, singer Madan had downplayed it. \"The music we make has very little to do with our backgrounds,\" she told Jackson. \"It has to do with our musical tastes. We merge musically.\" The most prominent part of Echobelly's success formula is vocalist Sonya Aurora Madan, who is also the group's primary lyricist. Born in Delhi, India, before moving to England at the age of two, Madan had an unusual background for a pop star. Her rigid upbringing made rock n' roll taboo for her as a youngster, and she didn't attend her first rock concert until she was in college. In 1990 she met Glenn Johansson, a guitarist from Sweden who was pursuing a career in music. Johansson had previously edited a Swedish pornographic magazine called Eros, which may contribute to the bands' focus on sexual issues in many of their songs. He and Madan dated for a while, then remained friends after breaking up. In 1993 Madan and Johansson teamed up with bass guitarist Alex Keyser and drummer Andy Henderson, who had previously played with P.J. Harvey's band. Guitarist Debbie Smith, formerly of Curve, came on board in 1994. According to the Epic Records' website, the group came up with the name Echobelly from the notion of \"being hungry for something.\" With Madan and Johansson serving as songwriters, Echobelly recorded their debut EP Bellyache on the independent Pandemonium label in late 1993. With songs such as \"Give Her a Gun\" and \"Sleeping Hitler,\" Bellyache demonstrated the group's willingness to boldly face provocative issues, both musically and lyrically. The title track was called \"a Johansson masterpiece, all throbbing tremelo guitars and pent-up angst,\" by the Epic website. Dealing with rejection has been a major theme for Echobelly--on the romantic, sexual, cultural, and political fronts. The favorable response to Bellyache helped Echobelly secure a contract with Rhythm King, which was then part of Epic. Once on board the label, the group made bigger waves on both sides of the Atlantic with their \"I Can' t Imagine the World Without Me\" single. Rolling Stone said that the song \"was filled with memorably aggressive but somewhat one-dimensional pop hooks,\" while the label's website called it \"a slice of pop heaven and undoubtedly the most confident pop record of the year.\" Now featuring the services of bass guitarist James Harris after Keyser defected due to personal and artistic differences, the group recorded the memorable Everybody's Got One album. This release, which included the single \"Insomniac,\" scored big with English fans and reached number eight on the U.K. pop charts. In his review of the album in the Village Voice, Barry Waiters asserted that Echobelly created \"a '90s strain of power pop that's got the bounce of Blondie with the crunch and ache of Nirvana.\" Waiters compared Madan's singing to Morrissey's, remarking, \"She's got a similarly dramatic, nearly vaudevillian way of sliding up and down a melody, emphasizing certain key words, twisting heartfelt syllables into rueful ironies.\" As their music received more airplay, Echobelly won admiration from other artists as well. Madonna expressed interest in putting them on her Maverick label, and R.E.M. requested the group as the opening act for their upcoming tour. The band returned to the studio in 1995 to create their next album, On, which proved even more popular than its predecessor. Produced by Shaun Slade and Paul Kolderie, who had also produced Hole and Radiohead, On was called \"eminently listenable\" by Tamara Palmer in Audio. \"Singer and lyricist Sonya Aurora Madan sounds as if she has become more aware of the beauty and strength in her voice, which emerges with a more poised and practiced edge,\" continued Palmer. This album focused on more universal themes, instead of the more politically and ethically charged subjects of Everyone's Got One. Madan's lyrics often ventured into the seamy side of life, such as the milieu of prostitution and homelessness addressed in \"King of the Kerb.\" \"I wanted to challenge myself as a lyricist on a different level on this album,\" Madan said in Rolling Stone. \"I want people to tell me what they thought the lyrics are about. I'm not a politician. I'm not interested in changing everybody around me. I'm interested in myself.\" While many of the songs lamented the state of things, others on the On album celebrated the endless possibilities of the human spirit. In \"Great Things,\" Madan sang \"I want to do great things/I don't want to compromise/Want to know what love is/I want to know everything.\" The album's mostly optimistic feel provides an intriguing contrast with its serious subject matter. As Pareles wrote, \"Both music and lyrics examine the tension between order and liberty.\" Pop hooks were established early in these songs, many of them displaying a sense of impatience that matched the urgency of the lyrics. Listeners in England responded favorably to the album, driving three singles from the release into the U.K.'s Top 20. Sales of the album rose to over 150,000 in England, nearly double that of Everyone's Got One. Health and legal problems interrupted the success of Echobelly in 1995 and 1996. Madan had a serious thyroid problem during her world tour that was potentially life-threatening, but was later cured. The group also had disagreements with Rhythm King after the label moved to Arista. The band chose to stay with Epic, which is part of Sony Music Entertainment. In 1996 Madan also ventured away from the group when she sang on a recording of the club band Lithium, that later released a single called \"Ride a Rocket.\" Smith left the band before the release of Lustre, which was scheduled to appear in record stores in the fall of 1997. A single from the album, \"The World Is Flat,\" was released in July of that year. \"On Lustre, we've brought out the darker side,\" noted Madan on the Miller Freeman Entertainment website.",

         "text" : "no title\n\nAt 29 years old, Tina Arena was Australia's most successful female singer. Actually a veteran in the music business, she has been singing professionally for over 20 years. \"As an artist, I'm not very one-dimensional,\" Arena stated in the Auckland Sunday News. \"I certainly like to diversify. I'm inspired by so many different styles. The listeners would be bored if they kept hearing the same old bloody thing. There's a bit of a rock bitch in me too that likes to come out occasionally.\" Her singing style has been characterized as something between rock and R&B. Carole King, Aretha Franklin, and Barbara Streisand were her early music idols. Arena is an international star who writes the lyrics and melodies to most of her songs. \"I found strength through writing these songs because I've been able to personally let go and be totally honest,\" the artist stated in her Epic Center biography. \"I'm a believer in honesty and optimism, and I guess that positivity in my character comes through. But all I wanted to do was come up with great songs reflecting my life. I feel most comfortable writing about personal experiences, and that's what I've done. Arena grew up in suburban Melbourne, the middle of three daughters of Italian immigrants. Born Filippina Arena, her name was abbreviated to Tina in 1975. At age three, she would listen and sing the Spanish, Italian, and French songs that were in the family record collection. The song \"You're My World,\" sung by Daryl Braithwaite, was one she memorized and sang often as a child. Her first performance was at age eight, when she sang \"You're My World\" in front of 400 guests at a family wedding. The audience loved it so much that they gave her a rallying ovation, which moved the young Arena to tears. She soon went on to compete in television talent contests, winning three out of four that she participated in. After one performance, she was asked to be a permanent member of the cast. Almost overnight, she became known as \"Tiny Tina\" on a show called Young Talent Time, which was a popular Australian TV show. She was a weekly TV star for about seven years, displaying her maturity and confidence in front of the camera. Fortunately, Arena was not overcome by her success. She proudly stayed away from drugs and bad relationships. At 16, she even went to work as an insurance clerk while also singing live in Melbourne pubs. Overnight, it seemed Arena went from TV sensation to pop music icon. She grew up performing on-stage, in bars and theatres, on the radio, and on tours. At the age of 21, she started to play in bands, and released her first single, \"Turn Up the Beat,\" in 1985. She took a break from singing in 1993 to appear in the nationwide Australian stage production of the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, in which she was the narrator. Her debut album Strong As Steel was very successful, with the single \"I Need Your Body,\" reaching platinum status. Soon afterward, she went to Los Angeles in an effort to gain independence, something she didn't have while producing records in Australia. \"I've done something that I have wanted to do for many years,\" Arena proclaimed in her Epic bio. \"And going to LA like I did proved that I was very able to do it. It was a fantastic learning experience and I felt a great sense of liberation.\" While in the United States, she recorded the album Don't Ask in 1996, which marked a milestone for the singer as she felt it was her first independent effort. \"I had gotten used to singing other people's songs, but this time they are my songs and my experience so I can sing them like I mean it,\" Arena stated in her Epic bio. \"The record is honest and sincere and simple.\" Don't Ask went ten times platinum in Australia, and was released in the United States in March of 1996, gaining airtime on over 200 radio stations. The single \"Chains\" focuses on breaking through stereotypes, which was the way she characterized her own singing career. \"I've finally begun believing in my ability,\" the artist announced in the Sony Music Artist Info website. \"I think it's so important to believe in yourself and know that if you work hard, it will pay off.\" She wrote ten of the 11 songs on the album. \"Chains\" hit gold after eight weeks, then platinum in 12. Soon, it reached the Top Ten in Britain and the American Top 40. Don't Ask went gold in it's first month of release, platinum in six months and over eight times platinum within a year. This made her the highest selling female artist in Australian history. In 1995 Arena toured Europe, appearing on Top Of The Pops TV program, which reached an audience of 60 million people. One of the proudest moments of her career was at the Australian Record Industry Awards in October of 1995 when she was awarded the Best Pop Release and Song of the Year for \"Chains.\" She also won the award for the highest selling Australian album and the Best Australian Album Award for Don't Ask. In addition, she was awarded Female Artist of the Year. Other accolades she earned were Variety Club Entertainer of the Year, an Advance Australia Foundation award, and a World Music Award. She returned to Los Angeles in 1996 and 1997 to record her third album, In Deep. She wrote four of the songs on the album. Contributions on the other seven songs came from Mick Jones, David Tyson, Christopher Ward, Dean McTaggart, Pam Reswick, and Steve Werfel. Ralph Carr began to manage Arena's music career and the two were married in December 1995. They live in the inner city of Melbourne. Arena had maintained many of the friendships she formed in high school. According to the Artist Info website, she once told a reporter, \"I feel rejuvenated ... I've really taken control of my own destiny. I've made the decisions about where I've wanted to go, what I've wanted to write about, who I've wanted to work with and how I want to be received.\" At the age of 29, Arena announced in September of 1997 that she is starting a charitable foundation to help disadvantaged children. \"Look, I'm not Mother Teresa,\" she told Steve McCarty of the South China Morning Post. \"But I want to give something back to the world; I just like giving so much more than receiving. I've been lucky, I have such a strong support network that I've never had to go jabbing my arm. I didn't fall into any traps like that after the whole child-star business.\" She feels her foundation can right some wrongs that she sees in her native country. \"The suicide rate among Australian youngsters is climbing,\" she told McCarty. \"Unemployment and dysfunctional families are partly the reason. Some kids just don't have any motivation. I'm hoping to fund youth education programmes by going out and performing at different events, setting up performance camps, giving them a goal.\" Among her contemporaries, Arena is influenced by Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and Maria McKee. In a nonmusical sense, she was also inspired by Princess Diana, who, she told McCarty, \"was a great role model for women, and we've lost some of that hope now.\" About men, she added, \"a wicked sense of humour: you need it as a weapon against the male testosterone when you're on the road.\"",

Soon afterward, she went to Los Angeles in an effort to gain independence, something she didn't have while producing records in Australia. \"I've done something that I have wanted to do for many years,\" Arena proclaimed in her Epic bio. \"And going to LA like I did proved that I was very able to do it. It was a fantastic learning experience and I felt a great sense of liberation.\" While in the United States, she recorded the album Don't Ask in 1996, which marked a milestone for the singer as she felt it was her first independent effort. \"I had gotten used to singing other people's songs, but this time they are my songs and my experience so I can sing them like I mean it,\" Arena stated in her Epic bio. \"The record is honest and sincere and simple.\" Don't Ask went ten times platinum in Australia, and was released in the United States in March of 1996, gaining airtime on over 200 radio stations. The single \"Chains\" focuses on breaking through stereotypes, which was the way she characterized her own singing career. \"I've finally begun believing in my ability,\" the artist announced in the Sony Music Artist Info website. \"I think it's so important to believe in yourself and know that if you work hard, it will pay off.\" She wrote ten of the 11 songs on the album. \"Chains\" hit gold after eight weeks, then platinum in 12. Soon, it reached the Top Ten in Britain and the American Top 40. Don't Ask went gold in it's first month of release, platinum in six months and over eight times platinum within a year. This made her the highest selling female artist in Australian history. In 1995 Arena toured Europe, appearing on Top Of The Pops TV program, which reached an audience of 60 million people. One of the proudest moments of her career was at the Australian Record Industry Awards in October of 1995 when she was awarded the Best Pop Release and Song of the Year for \"Chains.\" She also won the award for the highest selling Australian album and the Best Australian Album Award for Don't Ask. In addition, she was awarded Female Artist of the Year. Other accolades she earned were Variety Club Entertainer of the Year, an Advance Australia Foundation award, and a World Music Award. She returned to Los Angeles in 1996 and 1997 to record her third album, In Deep. She wrote four of the songs on the album. Contributions on the other seven songs came from Mick Jones, David Tyson, Christopher Ward, Dean McTaggart, Pam Reswick, and Steve Werfel. Ralph Carr began to manage Arena's music career and the two were married in December 1995. They live in the inner city of Melbourne. Arena had maintained many of the friendships she formed in high school. According to the Artist Info website, she once told a reporter, \"I feel rejuvenated ... I've really taken control of my own destiny. I've made the decisions about where I've wanted to go, what I've wanted to write about, who I've wanted to work with and how I want to be received.\" At the age of 29, Arena announced in September of 1997 that she is starting a charitable foundation to help disadvantaged children. \"Look, I'm not Mother Teresa,\" she told Steve McCarty of the South China Morning Post. \"But I want to give something back to the world; I just like giving so much more than receiving. I've been lucky, I have such a strong support network that I've never had to go jabbing my arm. I didn't fall into any traps like that after the whole child-star business.\" She feels her foundation can right some wrongs that she sees in her native country. \"The suicide rate among Australian youngsters is climbing,\" she told McCarty. \"Unemployment and dysfunctional families are partly the reason. Some kids just don't have any motivation. I'm hoping to fund youth education programmes by going out and performing at different events, setting up performance camps, giving them a goal.\" Among her contemporaries, Arena is influenced by Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and Maria McKee. In a nonmusical sense, she was also inspired by Princess Diana, who, she told McCarty, \"was a great role model for women, and we've lost some of that hope now.\" About men, she added, \"a wicked sense of humour: you need it as a weapon against the male testosterone when you're on the road.\"</body></html>",

A considerable amount of confusion has surrounded the taxonomic arrangement of the moss animals. A similar, although not so diverse, group of animals known as entoprocts have now been distinguished in their own phylum, Entoprocta. The vast majority of moss animals are exclusively marine-dwelling species (class Gymnolaemata), with just a few of the more than 4,000 species described to date found in freshwater ecosystems (class Phylactolaemata). A third class, Stenolaemata, is also recognized, but contains relatively few living marine species. More than 500 species, however, have been recorded in fossil history. This phylum is one of the largest of all animal taxonomic groups. Individually, moss animals are all tiny, often microscopic, animals that rarely measure more than 0.04 inch (1 mm) in length. However, individual animals (or zooids, as they are known) congregate to form large encrusting colonies, which may reach more than 3.3 feet (1 m) in diameter. Most species live in shallow waters, although some have been recorded from a depth of 18,045 feet (5,500 m). Colonies may form on any hard surface that is continuously under water—rocks, shells, submerged timbers, seaweeds, etc. Each animal is contained within its own body wall, which has just a single opening. A thin outer covering is secreted from the body wall to provide some support; there are no muscles within the body wall. The bulk of the body is taken up with the feeding and digestive system. There are no respiratory, circulatory, or excretory organs. Moss animals vary widely in appearance: some are oval, while others are almost square or vase-shaped. The top of each animal is dominated by a special feeding structure known as the lophophore. Basically this consists of a crown of 8–100 ciliated tentacles which are used to create water currents for filter-feeding. The mouth opening lies within the circle of tentacles, but the anus is outside—an adaptation to prevent fouling the tentacles with body wastes. When the animal is feeding, the lophophore is pushed out through the opening and the tentacles extended. The current created by the beating of tiny cilia sweeps a small water current down toward the base of the lophophore. Tiny food particles, mainly plankton, then enter the pharynx and pass through the digestive system to the stomach. Some species have a special lid that closes over the opening of the lophophore when the animal is not feeding. Most bryozoans (including all freshwater species) are hermaphroditic—that is, each individual animal contains male and female reproductive organs. Reproductive patterns vary considerably across the phylum: some species release eggs and sperm simultaneously to the sea, with fertilization taking place outside the body. Others retain their eggs, which are fertilized by sperm borne in with the water column. Some species may be self-fertilizing. The resulting trocophore larvae are released from the body wall and disperse with the water currents. Most larvae are nonfeeding and settle within a few hours of having been released from the parent animal. When an individual larva settles, it may reproduce and spread by asexual means, forming identical zooids to the parent cell.</body></html>",

Not only has the band outlasted almost every other band to emerge from the vibrant London reggae scene of the 1970s, it has also survived numerous personnel changes over the years. The group even avoided the pitfalls of succumbing to its own success; after securing a number one single, Aswad continued to develop its style regardless of its presence on the charts. Known for its energetic live shows, the band has also sustained its popularity with an extensive tour schedule in Europe, Japan, and the Americas. For its longevity alone, Aswad ranks among the most notable reggae bands, as well as one of the most commercially successful. Developed in Jamaica from the 1960s onward, reggae mixed traditional Caribbean rhythms, a prominent bass line, and often socially profound lyrics with elements of American jazz and R&B. In Britain, where many of the island's immigrants had settled after World War II, independent record companies brought the latest reggae releases to Jamaican expatriates. By the mid-1960s homegrown British reggae bands, such as the Cimarons, had sprung up among the immigrants and their children. Largely ignored by commercial radio and the major records labels, it was not until the mid-1970s that reggae began to be heard on a significant scale outside of the Anglo-Jamaican community in Britain. Formed around 1974 in London, the group Aswad was one of many bands that emerged during the fertile period in British reggae music. Deriving its name from the Arabic word for \"black,\" the group initially performed with five members. In addition to mainstay Angus \"Drummie Zeb\" Gaye on drums and vocals, the band included George \"Ras Levi\" Oban, Courtney Hemmings, Donald \"Benjamin\" Griffiths, and Brinsley \"Dan\" Forde on lead vocals. Forde was perhaps the best-known of the members at the time of the band's formation. As a child actor, he had appeared in several British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) programs. Over the years, the group's lineup would change several times. By the 1990s, Aswad was a trio consisting of Gaye and Forde, joined by Tony Gad after 1980 on bass. In the late 1990s, however, Forde also left the band, and Aswad carried on as a duo. In its first incarnation, Aswad reflected the multicultural, immigrant environment that made British reggae somewhat distinct from its island counterpart. After all, most of its members came from different countries: Gaye was born in London, Forde in Guyana, and Griffiths in Jamaica. Reflecting this diversity, the members found influences in Jamaican styles such as ska and rocksteady, precursors to reggae, as well as American jazz. Like many reggae artists, however, the band's lyrical output often focused on themes of struggle and survival in the midst of racial hostility. The band's first single, 1976's \"Back to Africa,\" referred to a longing for an idyllic mother land, while the follow-up single, \"Three Babylon,\" was a statement against police brutality. With its signing to Mango Records in 1975, a division of Chris Blackwell's Island Records, Aswad became the first reggae group from outside Jamaica signed to the renown label. A pioneer in his own right, Blackwell had facilitated the development of reggae in Britain in the early 1960s by producing some of the leading reggae artists in Jamaica and importing their records to the émigré Jamaican community in Britain and around the world. By the 1970s, Island Records was recognized as the premier international reggae label, a fact that established Aswad's credibility with reggae audiences from the start. With \"Back to Africa,\" Aswad found immediate success as the single hit number one on the British reggae charts. The band was also in demand as a backing group for visiting Jamaican reggae stars, including Black Uhuru and Bob Marley. Aswad also took part in the creative alliance between reggae and punk rock at the end of the 1970s, performing with New Wave acts such as the Police and Elvis Costello. With reggae's popularity at an ebb in Britain after 1980, however, one of the group's outstanding releases, 1981's Aswad's previous experimentation with jazz fusion, R&B, and various Jamaican styles had led some critics to question their commitment as bona-fide reggae artists. The band's breakthrough success in 1988 seemed to confirm this skepticism. Taking a tune co-written by prolific American songwriter Diane Warren--best known at the time for penning hits by DeBarge, Laura Branigan, and Michael Bolton--Aswad's version of \"Don't Turn Around\" hit number one on the singles chart in Britain in early 1988. The group followed the chart-topper with another hit co-authored by Warren, the top 20 single \"Give a Little Love.\" In similar fashion, Aswad's 1988 album Firmly established with mainstream audiences in Britain, Aswad continued to score on the charts with hits such as \"On and On\" in 1989 and \"Next to You\" in 1990, yet reggae purists continued to criticize the band for becoming too pop-oriented. In a 1994 The changes in Aswad's musical direction were reflected in the reggae world itself. As Gaye commented in a 1994 Summarizing the band's accomplishment upon the release of its On August 22, 2000, Aswad performed a concert in London that marked the band's twenty-fifth anniversary, a tribute that was recorded and released the following year as",

Since its beginnings as an animal sanctuary in 1999, the ranch has expanded in size and in scope, covering several acres and housing more than 130 animals in need and reaching thousands of teenagers and adults, after being in existence for a little more than a decade. At Gentle Barn, Weiner also connects area young people with animals that have experienced difficulty in the hopes of encouraging the ranch's human visitors to feel not only empathy and compassion with their animal counterparts, but also with others in their broader experience. The successes of the program helped the ranch achieve national notoriety and attracted big-name donors, including talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, actress Kirstie Alley, and companies such as Princess Cruises and CBS. Born Ellie Laks around 1967, the Gentle Barn founder developed a passion for neglected animals at a young age. \"When I was a little girl, I was one of those kids that was always dragging animals home--stray cats, stray dogs, ducks from a frozen pond,\" she recalled in a story printed in Thai Press Reports. Growing up on the East Coast, Weiner herself experienced abuse and sought comfort in her relationships with animals. \"The animals saved me and healed me. If they could do that for me, then they could do it for others,\" she noted in an interview with Karen Jones of the In 1999, Weiner launched a venture that combined her interests in helping youth with her life-long love of animals: Gentle Barn ranch. First situated on just a half-acre of land in Tarzana, California, Gentle Barn served as a sanctuary for animals that could not be properly cared for by their owners or had been in abusive or neglectful situations. One of its first adoptees was a sick goat that Weiner rescued from a downtrodden petting zoo. As more and more animals joined Gentle Barn's family, Weiner decided to expand the ranch's outreach efforts to include neglected, abused, or otherwise at-risk youth from the area. She reached out to inner-city schools and social services agencies to draw potential youth volunteers to the ranch. Before long, Gentle Ranch was welcoming young people from the Los Angeles area on a regular series of four-hour visits. During this time, visitors had the opportunity to care for animals, learn their stories, and simply develop an emotional bond with them. Community support and volunteer efforts also helped support the growing ranch. Among Gentle Barn's early volunteers was Jay Weiner, who developed a personal relationship with Gentle Barn's founder; the pair later married. With the help of these community volunteers, Gentle Barn soon expanded beyond its original confines. In 2003, Weiner purchased a six-acre tract of land outside of Los Angeles on which the ranch could grow. The ranch's programs came to include services for developmentally challenged children and adults with conditions ranging from autism to Alzheimer's so that a broader audience could be reached. \"The autistic kids shut out a lot of the outside world. After they are in with the animals, they start talking and opening up,\" Weiner told Carol Rock of the Los Angeles In October of 2007, the Gentle Barn faced a new challenge when wildfires raging in the California countryside threatened the ranch. After seeing smoke in the distance, Jay Weiner climbed to a high point on the ranch's property to observe the fires' progress and was stunned to discover that the flames were moving toward the grounds so rapidly that they were only about one mile away. Deciding to clear out Gentle Barn's human and animal resident, the owners posted a plea for short-term help housing their charges on classifieds Web site Craigslist and contacted other area organizations. Nearby sanctuary Animal Acres and others came through to temporarily provide shelter, although the process of transferring dozens of formerly abused animals from one place to another presented its own problems. \"It's unbelievable how clear they seemed on ... what was going on,\" Jay Weiner told Alison Stewart in an interview for NPR. But a few animals stalled and refused to board the waiting trailers, with one scared pig even running toward the fire before being convinced to enter the trailer. \"One of the cows ... wouldn't get on the trailer.... And so we had to walk down Sierra Highway, which is the street in front of our property, holding ... a 1,700-pound cow.... And then we had two draft horses ... that we were walking with down the street as well.\" Despite these stumbling blocks, the ranch's residents found their way to safety. Gentle Barn itself sustained several thousands of dollars of damage from the fire and accompanying winds. Weiner believes that the success of the youth-animal interactions stems from a human recognition of kinship with the ranch's rescued creatures. \"It's the at-risk kids that have been through abuse and neglect and hardship and being misunderstood, when they come face-to-face with an animal that has the exact same story, that's the healing element,\" the founder explained in a Thai Press Reports article. Weiner hopes to help people develop an understanding of shared commonalities among all creatures to encourage tolerance and acceptance among people who have experienced little compassion for their own problems during their lives. As young visitors relate to the journey of rescued animals from terrified and abused to accepting and loving, they themselves may begin to believe that they can undergo a similar transformation. \"I don't want to be a place where people come and just kind of enjoy animals, but not realize who they are and what we do here,\" Weiner commented in a separate Thai Press Reports story. \"They're animals that have gone through atrocities and they came out the other side being loving and forgiving.... So that in and of itself is a miracle.\"</body></html>",

The ancient Romans named it after the Roman messenger god with winged sandals because it moved across the sky so quickly. This speed is due to its very short annual orbit around the Sun; Mercury's year is just 88 days. Mercury's day, on the other hand is 59 Earth days long; it rotates very slowly on its axis. The Sun's intense glare makes it difficult to observe Mercury from Earth. Mercury is visible just above the horizon for only about one hour before sunrise and one hour after sunset. Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system with a diameter of about 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). (Earth's diameter is about 7,900 miles [12,720 kilometers].) Mercury's mass is just 5.5 percent of Earth's mass. On average, Mercury is 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) from the Sun. From Mercury, the Sun would appear three times larger than it does on Earth The Sun's intense gravitational field tilts Mercury's orbit and stretches it into a long ellipse (oval). Mercury has a rocky surface marked with the craters of asteroids and meteorites that have crashed into it. It has no moons. It has a thin atmosphere composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Daytime temperatures on Mercury reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius), but nighttime temperatures can drop to −290 degrees Fahrenheit (−180 degrees Celsius). There is no evidence of life on Mercury, and it is highly unlikely that life could exist in such harsh conditions. Mercury's surface is covered with deep craters, separated by plains and huge banks of cliffs. Mercury's most notable feature is an ancient crater called the Caloris Basin, about the size of the state of Texas. Astronomers believe that Mercury, like the Moon, was originally made of liquid rock that solidified as the planet cooled. Some meteorites hit the planet during its cooling stage and formed craters. Other meteorites broke through the cooling crust, causing lava to flow up to the surface and cover older craters, forming the plains. Mercury's core is nearly solid metal and is composed primarily of iron and nickel. This core, the densest of any in the solar system, accounts for about four-fifths of Mercury's diameter. It may also be responsible for creating the magnetic field that protects Mercury from the Sun's harsh particle wind. Mercury appears to have frozen water at its poles. This is somewhat surprising on such a hot planet, but the poles are never fully illuminated by the Sun. Astronomers first found evidence of water in 1991, which was confirmed in 2012 by the Missions to Mercury It is difficult to send spacecraft to Mercury because it is so close to the Sun. As of the end of 2013, there had only been two missions to Mercury, and both of them flew by the planet instead of attempting to land on it.

         "text" : "no title\n\nDuring the 1440s, Nuño Tristão explored a large portion of Africa's west coast in a series of expeditions commissioned by Portugal's Prince Henry the Navigator. Tristão, one of Prince Henry's most trusted sea captains, is credited with the discovery of Cape Blanc, Arguin Island, and the Gambia River. Tristão was one of the first Europeans to engage in the slave trade, and under his command Arguin Island became the staging area for slaves bound for Portugal. This fertile period of exploration of Africa's western coast established Portugal as a leader in the emerging colonial world. In 1415 Portugal began its era of geographic discovery and the establishment of colonies. At the time it had a relatively stable monarchy whose kings encouraged maritime trade. Portugal's natural geographic position on the Iberian Peninsula encouraged exploration in Africa. In 1415 the reigning royal family of John I took part in the assault on the port of Ceuta in northern Morocco. Ceuta, highly prized, was the terminus of the trans-Sahara trade route. After the successful invasion of Ceuta, the small, unrecognized country of Portugal began the domination of Europe over Africa and Asia that was to last for the next 400 years. The riddle of the unknown Atlantic had fascinated many generations of seamen. By the middle of the fourteenth century many cartographers felt that there was a sea route to India; however, the official doctrine of the Church was based on the Before Prince Henry, no one had attempted to venture out to the Sea of Obscurity or the Ocean of Darkness, as it was called, because of existing superstitions and frightening myths. According to accounts, monsters swam in the seas, and the overhead sun made the seawater boil and melted the pitch holding the ship's wooden beams together. The people inhabiting the African shore were known to be burned black by the sun and there was fear of being roasted alive. Magnetic rocks encouraged compasses to fail and if a ship escaped these hazards, it was only a matter of time before they would be caught in the steady flow of water that poured night and day over the edge of the flat world. Today it is known that the constant north-south flow or the Canary Current along the Saharan coast made it possible for ships to sail southward as far as West Africa but prevented a return voyage. Cape Bojador, south of the Canary Islands represented the point of no return. The coast of Africa was only known as far as Cape Nao, because of rumors that those who ventured beyond it would never return. In 1419 or 1420, less than five years after the fall of Ceuta, a Portuguese expedition under the command of João Gonçalves Zarco rediscovered the island of Madeira. In 1427 and 1432, two expeditions succeeded in reaching the Azore Islands where large quantities of timber were used for shipbuilding. For nearly twelve years Prince Henry sent out fourteen expeditions with the aim of rounding Cape Bojador, on the coast of what is know the Western Sahara. In 1432, Gil Eannes successfully rounded Cape Bojador. In 1441,Prince Henry outfitted two of the new caravel ships for separate journeys down the west coast of Africa with the instructions to travel south and capture native people for interrogation. Nuño Tristão, one of Henry's most trusted and experienced captains was given command of one ship and Antão Gonçalves the other. The two ships met at Rio de Oro in Western Sahara. They came across a market run by black Muslims dressed in robes and turbans. Although they had instructions to approach the local people peaceably, a skirmish ensued and ten prisoners were taken. Gonçalves sailed back to Portugal with the captives. Tristão continued an additional 320 miles south and named it Cape Blanc for its white sand. In 1442, Prince Henry sent Nuño Tristão on another expedition. On this voyage he traveled past Cape Blanc and below Cape Anna and discovered the Arguin archipelago. This discovery played an important role in Portuguese history, for it was here on the main island that Prince Henry authorized a fort and trading post that marked the beginning of colonialism in Africa. In addition, Tristão captured fourteen natives on Arguin Island and returned to Portugal a hero. The island became a busy slave-trading station, and for the next few years, Tristão made a series of slave raids on the coast of West Africa. In 1446, Tristão set out on his third and last voyage. Instructed by Prince Henry to push southward, he sailed beyond the Sénégal River, passed Cape Verde, the westernmost point in Africa, and sailed beyond the mouth of the Gambia River to an unnamed river. They launched the ship's boats and traveled upstream, where they were met by a barrage of poisoned arrow, hurled by hostile natives. Only five crew members survived the attack. The bodies of Nuño Tristão and eighteen of his men were buried at sea. The Portuguese navigations during Prince Henry's influence opened a new and unprecedented chapter in human history. Prince Henry combined his political and organizational talents to catalyze the great era of Portuguese exploration and discovery of which Nuño Tristão was a part. Prince Henry established himself at Sagres and although he never went to sea, he was influential in guiding the direction of Portuguese exploration for generations to come. He set in motion a program emphasizing geographical exploration, instead of focusing on commercial voyaging. He surrounded himself with scientists, geographers, astronomers and cartographers that led to the design of the caravel, the compilation of sea charts and sailing rudders and improved methods of navigation. Nuño Tristão was entrusted with sailing the first caravel, when he succeeded in reaching Cape Blanco in 1441. Twelve years of experimentation went into the evolution of this innovative design. The difficulty ships experienced when returning to Portugal against the prevailing north winds led to the evolution of the caravel. A hybrid, the ship's hull was modeled on the Atlantic fishing boat and the mast structure was borrowed from ships used in the Mediterranean. With its triangular sails, and small crews of thirty or less, the caravel was well adapted to maneuvering in and out of estuaries and shoals along the western coast of Africa. The success of Portuguese navigation depended, in great measure, on the work of Prince Henry and the captains he inspired and supported. The sailing conditions in the southern Atlantic were considerably different than navigating the familiar waters and landmarks in the Mediterranean and the northern European coast. Rarely out of site of land, European sailors had reasonably accurate charts of the main landforms and they mainly traveled in north to south directions. However, when Prince Henry's ships began exploring the south Atlantic they had no charts or familiar landmarks. Expert cartographers and astronomers assisted Prince Henry in correlating information brought by returning sea captains and detailed charts and maps slowly became more accurate and useful. The navigator's tools were the compass, sun and stars, and the astrolabe. The astrolabe was an efficient instrument for obtaining a position by sun or star altitudes. Portuguese navigators used the compass, a small magnetized metal bar mounted over cards with wind roses painted on them. With these tools, the captains and crew would note the changing altitudes at various points along the route. As new capes, headlands, and bays were discovered, they were fixed for latitude and added to Prince Henry's master chart. Gradually the men became familiar with deep-sea voyaging, and as the tools of the trade became more sophisticated, the voyages became more routine. The boiling ocean, the flood of waters at the world's end, and the magnetic rocks that destroyed ships were forgotten as the scientific approach to navigation took hold. As for Tristão's slave raids, they continued until 1445, when Prince Henry refused to allow his crews to kidnap Africans. Prince Henry, like many Europeans, saw Africans as potential Christian converts, and when first slaves came to Portugal, they were permitted to intermarry with the Christian Portuguese and absorbed into society. They were also permitted to buy their freedom. Prince Henry's dictum against In the fifteenth century, it must be remembered, the idea of slavery was not a new one. It was as old as civilization itself, appearing in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. In addition, slavery was a recognized hazard for every European seaman who sailed the Mediterranean, since Moorish pirates sought both human and inanimate cargo. Men who were taken prisoner during warfare knew that they would probably become slaves. In addition, slavery had always been an integral part of African culture and society, and black slaves had been traded to the Islamic world since the middle of the seventh century. The widespread nature of slavery made it an easy and profitable business for the Portuguese. Beginning about 1450, Portuguese merchants bought slaves from the northward-bound caravans from Arguim, tapping into a longstanding trans-Saharan trade. By the end of the fifteenth century, 1,200-2,500 slaves per year were being exported. This complex preexisting system contributed to the massive exportation of Africans during the next two centuries.",

Mead does not shrink from difficult subjects. She has written about the war in Kosovo, famine and civil war in the Sudan, and the perils of reaching manhood in an inner-city housing project. Mead once commented: \"I have always been interested in writing about children who--for some reason--live on the edge of the mainstream society. I feel that authors and artists should travel to these edges, to widen the circle of inclusion through empathy and art.\" What Mead's heroes and heroines share is a resiliency of spirit and an ability to find humanity in themselves and others. Junebug, an African-American boy growing up in New Haven, Connecticut, stands up to bullies when they threaten smaller children and nurtures a dream of owning his own boat. Zana Dugolli in Mead was born in Portchester, New York, in 1952. On her Web site, she maintains that she began to entertain flights of imagination during a two-year stay in an industrial city in the north of England. The majority of her childhood was spent in America, where she developed an interest in the countries behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe. One summer, when she was twenty, she worked at a camp for inner-city children. Observing their delight in the art supplies she provided helped her to decide to be a teacher. \"For many years I was an art teacher working with low-income children,\" Mead once explained. \"In America, wealth abounds yet a large proportion of American children are poor. Everyone tells poor kids to have hopes, to dream--but how do you go about it? We have a society that sees children in very negative ways. I like to celebrate the intensity and steadfastness of kids, their creativity and fresh energy.\" When an illness made it impossible for Mead to teach anymore, she stayed home and began writing. Her books reflect her experience with youngsters here and abroad, as well as her beliefs in peaceful cooperation and nonviolence. An early inspiration to write about her adopted state of Maine led to the creation of her first novel, Rayanne, the central character in Like Rayanne, Scott, the main character in Reeve McClain, known as Junebug, reluctantly approaches his tenth birthday in Mead's novel Junebug proved such a popular character that Mead has built a series around him. In Mead has set two stories in the war-torn state of Kosovo: Mead herself once said: \"For the past [several] years, I have been traveling to Eastern Europe. When I was little, I was told that these countries lay behind the Iron Curtain, a place Americans didn't go. Since the collapse of communism, I have traveled there . . . to document the conditions of children's lives. My novel, Continuing to deal with the theme of war, but from a different perspective, Mead's novel Mead lives in a house that overlooks Casco Bay off the coast of Maine. On her Web site the author said, \"When I'm stuck writing a story, I can go sit on the rocks and watch the water for a while, something I have enjoyed doing throughout my life.\"",
