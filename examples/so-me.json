She was originally a member of the girl group Choice. In 1995, LaFace Records saw potential in Pink and offered her a solo recording contract. Her R&B-influenced debut studio album Can't Take Me Home (2000) was certified double-platinum in the United States and spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top-ten songs: \"There You Go\" and \"Most Girls\". She gained further recognition with the collaborative single \"Lady Marmalade\" from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack, which topped many charts worldwide. Refocusing her sound to pop rock with her second studio album Missundaztood (2001), the album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide and yielded the international number-one songs \"Get the Party Started\", \"Don't Let Me Get Me\", and \"Just Like a Pill\". While Pink's third studio album, Try This (2003), sold fewer copies than her previous work, it earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single \"Trouble\". She returned to the top of record charts with her fourth and fifth studio albums, I'm Not Dead (2006) and Funhouse (2008), which generated the top-ten entries \"Who Knew\" and \"U + Ur Hand\", as well as the number-one single \"So What\". Pink's sixth studio album, The Truth About Love (2012), was her first album to debut atop the Billboard 200 chart and spawned her fourth number-one single, \"Just Give Me a Reason\". In 2014, Pink recorded a collaborative album, Rose Ave., with Canadian musician Dallas Green under a folk music duo named You+Me. Her seventh studio album, Beautiful Trauma (2017), became the third best-selling album of the year and saw the success of its lead single, \"What About Us\". Recognized for her distinctive, raspy voice and acrobatic stage presence,[1][2] Pink has sold over 90 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists.[3] Her career accolades include three Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award and seven MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. In 2009, Billboard named Pink the Pop Songs Artist of the Decade. Pink was also the second most-played female solo artist in the United Kingdom, during the 2000s decade, behind Madonna. VH1 ranked her number 10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music, while Billboard awarded her the Woman of the Year award in 2013. At the 63rd annual BMI Pop Awards, she received the BMI President's Award for \"her outstanding achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry.\"[4] Alecia Beth Moore was born on September 8, 1979,[5] in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, to emergency room nurse Judith \"Judy\" Moore (n\u00e9e Kugel)[6] and insurance salesman James \"Jim\" Moore.[7][8][9][10] She has described herself as an \"Irish-German-Lithuanian-Jew\",[11] and self-identifies as Jewish.[12][13] Although a healthy baby at birth, she quickly developed asthma that plagued her through her early years.[14] When Pink was a toddler, her parents began having marital problems and divorced before she was 10.[15] Pink was trained as a competitive gymnast between the ages 4 and 12.[16][17] She developed her voice early in life. She attended Central Bucks High School West.[7] In high school, Pink joined her first band, Middleground, but it disbanded upon losing a battle of the bands competition. As a teenager, she wrote lyrics as an outlet for her feelings, and her mother commented, \"Her initial writings were always very introspective. Some of it was very black, and very deep, almost worrisome.\"[14] Pink began performing in Philadelphia clubs when she was about 14 years old. She adopted her stagename, \"Pink\", around this time. She had that nickname for quite some time by that point, and initially it had been \"a mean thing\".[18] She had gotten that name from the character \"Mr. Pink\" in Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs. Pink has said, \"I was extreme. I went through phases from skateboarder, to hip-hopper, to rave child, to lead singer in a band. I did it all, and all at the same time.\" At 14, she was convinced to audition to become a member of the all-female group Basic Instinct, and earned a spot in the lineup. Ultimately, the group disbanded without releasing any material.[19] At 16, Pink and two other teenage girls, Sharon Flanagan[20] and Chrissy Conway, formed the R&B group Choice. A copy of their first song, \"Key to My Heart\", was sent to LaFace Records in Atlanta, Georgia, where L.A. Reid overheard it and arranged for the group to fly there so he could see them perform. After that, he signed them to a record deal. Since the three girls were under 18 at the time, their parents had to cosign the contract. The group relocated to Atlanta and recorded an album, which was never released, but \"Key to My Heart\" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Kazaam. During a Christmas party, Reid gave Pink an ultimatum: go solo or go home. Choice disbanded in 1998.[21] After Choice disbanded, Pink signed a recording contract with LaFace Records and began working on her debut solo album with producers such as Babyface, Kandi Burruss and Tricky Stewart.[22] Her debut single, \"There You Go\", was released in February 2000 and became her first top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number seven.[23] Internationally, the song also charted inside the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.[24] In April, Pink's debut album, Can't Take Me Home, was released to commercial success. It peaked 26 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for two million units shipped in the United States.[25][26] It also went platinum in the United Kingdom and multi-platinum in Australia and Canada, while selling over four million copies worldwide.[27][28][29] Critical reception to the album was mixed.[30] The album's second single, \"Most Girls\", peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100[23] and became her first chart-topping single in Australia.[31] \"You Make Me Sick\" was released as the final single and reached number 33 on the Hot 100.[23] Pink won the trophy for Female New Artist of the Year at the 2000 Billboard Music Awards.[32] She was billed as a supporting act on the North American leg of NSYNC's No Strings Attached Tour throughout the summer of 2000.[33] In 2001, Pink, alongside singers Christina Aguilera and M\u00fda as well as rapper Lil' Kim, performed a cover of \"Lady Marmalade\" for the soundtrack of the film Moulin Rouge!. In the US it became the most successful airplay-only single in history, as well as Pink's first #1 single.[34] The success of the single was helped by its music video, which was popular on music channels[35] and won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.[36] The song won Pink's first Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals[37] Tired of being marketed as another cookie cutter pop act, as well as eager both to be seen as a more serious songwriter and musician and to perform the type of music she wanted to, Pink took her sound in a new direction and sought more artistic or creative control during the recording of her second album, Missundaztood.[38] She recruited Linda Perry, former singer of 4 Non Blondes (one of Pink's favorite groups in her teenage years).[39] Pink moved into Perry's Los Angeles home where the pair spent several months writing songs for the album.[40] Perry co-wrote and co-produced the album with Dallas Austin and Scott Storch, and according to VH1's Driven program, Antonio \"LA\" Reid of LaFace Records was not initially content with the new music Pink was making. The album, named Missundaztood because of Pink's belief that people had a wrong image of her,[39] was released in November 2001.[41] \"Get the Party Started\" was released as the lead single and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It also became a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Romania, and Spain, as well as spending four weeks at the top of the European Hot 100 Singles chart.[42] At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, its music video won in the categories of Best Female Video and Best Dance Video. The album's other singles\u2014\"Don't Let Me Get Me\", \"Just Like a Pill\", and \"Family Portrait\"\u2014were also radio and chart successes, with \"Just Like a Pill\" becoming Pink's second number-one hit in the United Kingdom. Missundaztood remains Pink's best-selling record with over 13 million copies sold worldwide.[43][44] According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Missundaztood was the eighth best-selling album of 2002 globally.[45] Pink won a World Music Award for Best Selling American Pop/Rock Female Artist.[46] She was also nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 45th Grammy Awards. Faith Hill's 2002 album, Cry, features a song co-written by Pink and Perry (\"If You're Gonna Fly Away\"). In 2002, Pink headlined a tour of America, Europe and Australia, the Party Tour, as well as becoming a supporting act for Lenny Kravitz's American tour. Pink was named the Top Female Billboard 200 Artist of 2002.[47] In mid-2003, Pink contributed the song \"Feel Good Time\" to the soundtrack of the film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, in which she had a cameo appearance as a motocross race ramp owner/promoter. Featuring electronic music artist William Orbit, it became Pink's first single to miss the top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, although it was a hit in Europe and in Australia. It was later included on non-U.S. editions of Pink's third album, Try This, which was released on November 11, 2003. Eight of the 13 tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of the band Rancid. Linda Perry was featured on the album as a writer and musician. Despite the album reaching the top ten on album charts in the US, in Canada, in the UK, and in Australia, sales were considerably lower than those of Missundaztood. However, it did go platinum in the US. The singles \"Trouble\" and \"God Is a DJ\" did not reach the US top 40 but did reach the top ten in other countries, and \"Last to Know\" was released as a single outside North America. \"Trouble\" earned Pink the Grammy award in Best Female Rock Vocal Performance category at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, and \"Feel Good Time\" was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.[37] She toured extensively on the Try This Tour through Europe and Australia, where the album was better received. During the same period, Pink co-wrote the song \"Take A Picture\" with Damon Elliott which was released on M\u00fda's album Moodring. In 2005, Pink collaborated with Lisa Marie Presley on the track \"Shine\", released on Presley's second album Now What. Pink took a break to write the songs for her fourth album, I'm Not Dead, which she said she titled as such because \"It's about being alive and feisty and not sitting down and shutting up even though people would like you to.\"[48] Pink worked with producers Max Martin, Billy Mann, Christopher Rojas, Butch Walker, Lukasz Gottwald, and Josh Abraham on the album. The album's release through LaFace Records in April 2006 was a substantial success throughout the world, particularly in Australia.

I was a fan right from the first time I heard 'Holiday'.\"[139] Pink also won her first talent show singing Madonna's \"Oh Father\".[140] Of Janis Joplin, Pink said \"She was so inspiring by singing blues music when it wasn't culturally acceptable for white women, and she wore her heart on her sleeve. She was so witty and charming and intelligent, but she also battled an ugly-duckling syndrome. I would love to play her in a movie.\"[139] In a tribute performance on her Try This Tour, Pink called Joplin \"a woman who inspired me when everyone else ... didn't!\"[141] As a child, she admired the leader of 4 Non Blondes, Linda Perry, whom she would later track down and form a close relationship with on her second album. She said: \"Literally this woman spoke to me. Being in pain and being on drugs and being misunderstood and, yeah she spoke my language. Without having to say anything, she could sing a note and it was what I was feeling. I used to sit at three or four o' clock in the morning, tripping on whatever, screaming 4 Non Blondes out the window until the cops were called\".[142] Other influences for Pink include Joan Jett, Mary J. Blige, Billy Joel, and Whitney Houston.[143][144] Throughout her career, she has received applause from critics for her powerful vocals.[145][146][147][148] Her voice has been described as \"raspy\", \"husky\", and \"distinctive.\"[149] James Montgomery of MTV calls her \"a deceptively good singer ... who can out-sing almost anyone\".[148] The Guardian describes her voice as \"prodigious\".[150] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times labelled her as \"a powerhouse vocalist\".[151] Pink has also received acclaim for her \"raw\", \"soulful\" voice and her ability to emote. The Inquirer defined her voice as \"husky\" and \"gutsy\", further complimenting her for developing into a \"powerfully emotive vocalist\", while comparing her to Janis Joplin.[152] The Star Tribune commends her by writing, \"Her slightly raspy, slightly soulful voice made you feel the dysfunction in 'Family Portrait', the longing of 'Who Knew' and the empowerment in 'Perfect'.\"[153] CNN has said that Pink is known for singing \"with the right level of emotion\".[154] Fellow pop artist Kelly Clarkson believes that Pink's voice is \"the best of our generation\".[155] Aside from her music, Pink has been noted for her fashion style, such the \"adventurous\" hairstyles she has worn, which have included fluorescent spikes to pink-streaked dreadlocks to a pitch-black skater cut.[156] Regarding her style, she told InStyle, \"I'm eclectic. I'm a tomboy, but I'm kind of a hippie and kind of a gangster [...] I don't know if that's a good thing, but it is my thing.\"[156] Pink is an animal-rights activist and a prominent campaigner for PETA, contributing her voice toward causes such as the protest against KFC.[157] In conjunction with PETA, she criticized the Australian wool industry over its use of mulesing. In January 2007, she stated that she had been misled by PETA about mulesing and that she had not done enough research before lending her name to the campaign.[158] Her campaigning led to a headlining concert called PAW (Party for Animals Worldwide) in Cardiff, Wales on August 21, 2007.[159] In 2015, she posed nude for PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\", campaign.[160] Pink is also outspoken about LGBT rights and supports same-sex marriage.[161] In October 2012, Pink told The Advocate that she does not define her sexuality saying, \"I never felt the need to.\"[162] Pink is also involved with several charities, including Human Rights Campaign, ONE Campaign, Prince's Trust, New York Restoration Project, Run for the Cure Foundation, Save the Children, Take Back the Night, UNICEF and World Animal Protection.[163] As of May 2008, Pink has been officially recognized as an advocate for the RSPCA in Australia. On February 16, 2009, Pink announced she was donating $250,000 to the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal to aid the victims of the bushfires that swept through the Australian state of Victoria earlier that month.[164] Pink stated that she wanted to make \"a tangible expression of support\".[165] Pink also donated money to Autism Speaks.[166] In August 2012, Pink became a spokesmodel for CoverGirl, featuring in a fall 2013 advertising campaign themed \"beauty with an edge\".[167] On August 21, 2018, Pink stopped her concert in Brisbane for a grieving fan. A girl named Leah lost her mother one month prior to the concert, and she and her family hung up signs all around the concert, saying \"My name is Leah \u2013 I'm 14 years old. I lost my beautiful Mum last month. I would LOVE a hug\u2026 Please!\". The signs grabbed the attention of Pink.[168] Pink has been credited for breaking boundaries and pushing the envelope throughout her career. She is regarded as the \"most trailblazing artist\" of her pop generation.[151][169] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times says, \"Pink stood up for her music, broke the music industry's mold and scored a breakout hit, challenging a school of teen singers to find their own sounds as well.\" He adds, \"[Pink] also started a race among other teen pop stars like Christina Aguilera to add substance to their own sound.\"[170] Ann Powers refers to her as a \"powerhouse vocalist\", stating her mix of rebellion, emotional rawness, humor, and \"infectious\" dance beats created \"a model for the mashup approach of latter-day divas such as Katy Perry, Kesha, and even Rihanna.\"[151] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone commented: \"I think people respond to her sense of independence and dedication. It inspires people... This is a prolific pop artist who is sometimes famous and successful, sometimes obscure, who nonetheless keeps making her own kind of music.\"[151] James Montgomery of MTV describes her as \"a fabulously fearless pop artist\" who can \"out-sing almost anyone out there. She can out-crazy Gaga or Lily. She's the total pop-star package, everything you'd want in a singer/entertainer/icon. And still, she remains oddly off the radar. Such is the price of busting borders\".[169] Entertainment Weekly said: \"She essentially invented the whole modern wave of Pop Diva Domination: You can draw a straight line from \"Get This Party Started\" to Katy Perry, Kesha, pre-messianic Lady Gaga, and post-weird Rihanna.\"[171] Glamour Magazine wrote: \"When Pennsylvania-born Alecia Moore debuted in 2000, pop was dominated by long-locked blonds like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. Pink changed the game. Without her, the last 13 years of big-voiced, tough chick music is hard to imagine.\"[172][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Following her performance at the American Music Awards of 2012, LZ Granderson of CNN wrote: \"... our culture's biggest sin may well be the auto-tuned syrup we've allowed to dominate the pop charts. All-time chart records are handed to vacuous acts such as the Black Eyed Peas and singing awards are given to vocal lightweights such as Taylor Swift [...] But thank God for Pink. [...] While Christina Aguilera has a tendency to oversing, Britney Spears can't sing, and Lauryn Hill sorta stopped singing, Pink has managed to carve a brilliant 13-year career by being something that is incredibly rare these days\u2014an artist.\"[173]British soul singer Adele considers Pink's performance at Brixton Academy in London as one of \"the most defining moments\" in her life, saying \"It was the Missundaztood record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live. I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible.\"[174][175] Pink's work has inspired several other artists including Demi Lovato,[176] Kelly Clarkson,[177] Taylor Swift,[178] Katy Perry,[179] Tegan and Sara,[180] Ashley Tisdale,[181] Alessia Cara,[182] Victoria Justice,[183] Adele,[184] Julia Michaels,[185] Ben Hopkins of Pwr Bttm[186] and Dua Lipa.[187] Pink met professional motocross racer Carey Hart at the 2001 X Games in Philadelphia. Following a brief separation in 2003, Pink proposed to Hart in June 2005 during a Mammoth Lakes motocross race; she was \"assisting\" in his race and wrote \"Will You Marry Me? I'm serious!\" on a pit board. He initially didn't notice and continued on for another lap. When he did notice later, he veered off the track to accept right then. She then made him finish the race.[188][189] They married in Costa Rica on January 7, 2006.[190] After months of speculation, Pink announced in February 2008, that she and Hart had separated.[191][192] Hart subsequently appeared in the video for her 2008 song \"So What\",[193] which deals with their separation.[194] The couple sought marriage counseling during their separation[195] in hopes of reconciliation.[196] In February 2010, Pink confirmed that she and Hart were back together.[197] Hart also appears with Pink in the music video for her songs \"Just Give Me a Reason\", \"True Love\", and \"Just like Fire\".[198][199] In November 2010, Pink announced on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she and Hart were expecting their first child.[200] In June 2011, she gave birth to their daughter, Willow Sage.[201] In December 2016, she gave birth to their second child, a son, Jameson Moon.[202][203] Pink is a supporter of attachment parenting.[204] In 2010, she appeared on Forbes' \"The Celebrity 100\" list at #27, with earnings of $44 million.[205] In 2011, she appeared on Forbes' The Top-Earning Women in Music list at #6 with earnings of $22 million, with an average of $1 million per show on the road.[206] In 2009, Billboard put her at the 6th place on their \"Money Makers\" list, listing her earnings as $36,347,658.[207] In 2013, she appeared on Forbes' list of \"Highest Paid Musicians\", with the earnings of $32 million.[208] In 2018, she appeared on Forbes' list of \"Highest Paid Female Celebrities\", with the earnings of $52 million.[209] According to Nielsen SoundScan, Pink's record sales stand at 16 million copies in the United States.[210] Pink has sold over 40 million albums and 50 million singles worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists.[3]",

She was originally a member of the girl group Choice. In 1995, LaFace Records saw potential in Pink and offered her a solo recording contract. Her R&amp;B-influenced debut studio album Can't Take Me Home (2000) was certified double-platinum in the United States and spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top-ten songs: \"There You Go\" and \"Most Girls\". She gained further recognition with the collaborative single \"Lady Marmalade\" from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack, which topped many charts worldwide. Refocusing her sound to pop rock with her second studio album Missundaztood (2001), the album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide and yielded the international number-one songs \"Get the Party Started\", \"Don't Let Me Get Me\", and \"Just Like a Pill\".\nWhile Pink's third studio album, Try This (2003), sold fewer copies than her previous work, it earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single \"Trouble\". She returned to the top of record charts with her fourth and fifth studio albums, I'm Not Dead (2006) and Funhouse (2008), which generated the top-ten entries \"Who Knew\" and \"U + Ur Hand\", as well as the number-one single \"So What\". Pink's sixth studio album, The Truth About Love (2012), was her first album to debut atop the Billboard 200 chart and spawned her fourth number-one single, \"Just Give Me a Reason\". In 2014, Pink recorded a collaborative album, Rose Ave., with Canadian musician Dallas Green under a folk music duo named You+Me. Her seventh studio album, Beautiful Trauma (2017), became the third best-selling album of the year and saw the success of its lead single, \"What About Us\".\nRecognized for her distinctive, raspy voice and acrobatic stage presence,[1][2] Pink has sold over 90 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists.[3] Her career accolades include three Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award and seven MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. In 2009, Billboard named Pink the Pop Songs Artist of the Decade. Pink was also the second most-played female solo artist in the United Kingdom, during the 2000s decade, behind Madonna. VH1 ranked her number 10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music, while Billboard awarded her the Woman of the Year award in 2013. At the 63rd annual BMI Pop Awards, she received the BMI President's Award for \"her outstanding achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry.\"[4]\nAlecia Beth Moore was born on September 8, 1979,[5] in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, to emergency room nurse Judith \"Judy\" Moore (n\u00e9e Kugel)[6] and insurance salesman James \"Jim\" Moore.[7][8][9][10] She has described herself as an \"Irish-German-Lithuanian-Jew\",[11] and self-identifies as Jewish.[12][13] Although a healthy baby at birth, she quickly developed asthma that plagued her through her early years.[14] When Pink was a toddler, her parents began having marital problems and divorced before she was 10.[15]\nPink was trained as a competitive gymnast between the ages 4 and 12.[16][17] She developed her voice early in life. She attended Central Bucks High School West.[7] In high school, Pink joined her first band, Middleground, but it disbanded upon losing a battle of the bands competition. As a teenager, she wrote lyrics as an outlet for her feelings, and her mother commented, \"Her initial writings were always very introspective. Some of it was very black, and very deep, almost worrisome.\"[14]\nPink began performing in Philadelphia clubs when she was about 14 years old. She adopted her stagename, \"Pink\", around this time. She had that nickname for quite some time by that point, and initially it had been \"a mean thing\".[18] She had gotten that name from the character \"Mr. Pink\" in Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs. Pink has said, \"I was extreme. I went through phases from skateboarder, to hip-hopper, to rave child, to lead singer in a band. I did it all, and all at the same time.\" At 14, she was convinced to audition to become a member of the all-female group Basic Instinct, and earned a spot in the lineup. Ultimately, the group disbanded without releasing any material.[19] At 16, Pink and two other teenage girls, Sharon Flanagan[20] and Chrissy Conway, formed the R&amp;B group Choice. A copy of their first song, \"Key to My Heart\", was sent to LaFace Records in Atlanta, Georgia, where L.A. Reid overheard it and arranged for the group to fly there so he could see them perform. After that, he signed them to a record deal. Since the three girls were under 18 at the time, their parents had to cosign the contract. The group relocated to Atlanta and recorded an album, which was never released, but \"Key to My Heart\" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Kazaam. During a Christmas party, Reid gave Pink an ultimatum: go solo or go home. Choice disbanded in 1998.[21]\nAfter Choice disbanded, Pink signed a recording contract with LaFace Records and began working on her debut solo album with producers such as Babyface, Kandi Burruss and Tricky Stewart.[22] Her debut single, \"There You Go\", was released in February 2000 and became her first top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number seven.[23] Internationally, the song also charted inside the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.[24] In April, Pink's debut album, Can't Take Me Home, was released to commercial success. It peaked 26 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for two million units shipped in the United States.[25][26] It also went platinum in the United Kingdom and multi-platinum in Australia and Canada, while selling over four million copies worldwide.[27][28][29] Critical reception to the album was mixed.[30] The album's second single, \"Most Girls\", peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100[23] and became her first chart-topping single in Australia.[31] \"You Make Me Sick\" was released as the final single and reached number 33 on the Hot 100.[23]\nPink won the trophy for Female New Artist of the Year at the 2000 Billboard Music Awards.[32] She was billed as a supporting act on the North American leg of NSYNC's No Strings Attached Tour throughout the summer of 2000.[33] In 2001, Pink, alongside singers Christina Aguilera and M\u00fda as well as rapper Lil' Kim, performed a cover of \"Lady Marmalade\" for the soundtrack of the film Moulin Rouge!. In the US it became the most successful airplay-only single in history, as well as Pink's first #1 single.[34] The success of the single was helped by its music video, which was popular on music channels[35] and won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.[36] The song won Pink's first Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals[37]\nTired of being marketed as another cookie cutter pop act, as well as eager both to be seen as a more serious songwriter and musician and to perform the type of music she wanted to, Pink took her sound in a new direction and sought more artistic or creative control during the recording of her second album, Missundaztood.[38] She recruited Linda Perry, former singer of 4 Non Blondes (one of Pink's favorite groups in her teenage years).[39] Pink moved into Perry's Los Angeles home where the pair spent several months writing songs for the album.[40] Perry co-wrote and co-produced the album with Dallas Austin and Scott Storch, and according to VH1's Driven program, Antonio \"LA\" Reid of LaFace Records was not initially content with the new music Pink was making. The album, named Missundaztood because of Pink's belief that people had a wrong image of her,[39] was released in November 2001.[41]\n\"Get the Party Started\" was released as the lead single and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It also became a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Romania, and Spain, as well as spending four weeks at the top of the European Hot 100 Singles chart.[42] At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, its music video won in the categories of Best Female Video and Best Dance Video. The album's other singles\u2014\"Don't Let Me Get Me\", \"Just Like a Pill\", and \"Family Portrait\"\u2014were also radio and chart successes, with \"Just Like a Pill\" becoming Pink's second number-one hit in the United Kingdom. Missundaztood remains Pink's best-selling record with over 13 million copies sold worldwide.[43][44] According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Missundaztood was the eighth best-selling album of 2002 globally.[45] Pink won a World Music Award for Best Selling American Pop/Rock Female Artist.[46] She was also nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 45th Grammy Awards. Faith Hill's 2002 album, Cry, features a song co-written by Pink and Perry (\"If You're Gonna Fly Away\"). In 2002, Pink headlined a tour of America, Europe and Australia, the Party Tour, as well as becoming a supporting act for Lenny Kravitz's American tour. Pink was named the Top Female Billboard 200 Artist of 2002.[47]\nIn mid-2003, Pink contributed the song \"Feel Good Time\" to the soundtrack of the film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, in which she had a cameo appearance as a motocross race ramp owner/promoter. Featuring electronic music artist William Orbit, it became Pink's first single to miss the top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, although it was a hit in Europe and in Australia. It was later included on non-U.S. editions of Pink's third album, Try This, which was released on November 11, 2003. Eight of the 13 tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of the band Rancid. Linda Perry was featured on the album as a writer and musician. Despite the album reaching the top ten on album charts in the US, in Canada, in the UK, and in Australia, sales were considerably lower than those of Missundaztood. However, it did go platinum in the US. The singles \"Trouble\" and \"God Is a DJ\" did not reach the US top 40 but did reach the top ten in other countries, and \"Last to Know\" was released as a single outside North America. \"Trouble\" earned Pink the Grammy award in Best Female Rock Vocal Performance category at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, and \"Feel Good Time\" was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.[37] She toured extensively on the Try This Tour through Europe and Australia, where the album was better received.\nDuring the same period, Pink co-wrote the song \"Take A Picture\" with Damon Elliott which was released on M\u00fda's album Moodring. In 2005, Pink collaborated with Lisa Marie Presley on the track \"Shine\", released on Presley's second album Now What. Pink took a break to write the songs for her fourth album, I'm Not Dead, which she said she titled as such because \"It's about being alive and feisty and not sitting down and shutting up even though people would like you to.\"[48] Pink worked with producers Max Martin, Billy Mann, Christopher Rojas, Butch Walker, Lukasz Gottwald, and Josh Abraham on the album. The album's release through LaFace Records in April 2006 was a substantial success throughout the world, particularly in Australia. The album reached the top ten in the US, the top five in the UK, No. 1 in Germany, and was No. 1 in Australia for two non-consecutive weeks.\nThe album's lead single, \"Stupid Girls\", was Pink's biggest US hit since 2002 and earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Its music video, in which she parodies celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, Mary-Kate Olsen, and Paris Hilton,[49] won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video. Subsequent singles \"Who Knew\" and \"U + Ur Hand\" were substantial hits in Australia and Europe, and they later became top ten singles in the US. in 2007. The non-US singles were \"Nobody Knows\", a minor hit in the UK, Australia and Germany; \"Dear Mr. President\", an open letter to the US President George W. Bush which featured the Indigo Girls and became a No. 1 hit in Belgium as well as a top five hit in Germany, Australia, and other countries; \"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\", a UK top 40 and Australian top five entry; and \"'Cuz I Can\". The album has sold over 1.3\u00a0million copies in the US, as well as over 700,000 copies in Australia. The album proved very popular in Australia, with six top five singles and a record-breaking 62 weeks in the top 10; so far the album has gone 10 times platinum.\nIn support of the album, Pink embarked on the world I'm Not Dead Tour, for which ticket sales in Australia were particularly high; she sold approximately 307,000 tickets in Australia, giving her the record for the biggest concert attendance for an arena tour by a female artist.[50] One of the London shows on the tour was taped and released as a DVD, Pink: Live from Wembley Arena, where she sang Linda Perry's \"Whats Up?\". In 2006, Pink was chosen to sing the theme song for NBC Sunday Night Football, \"Waiting All Day for Sunday Night\", which is a take on \"I Hate Myself for Loving You\" by Joan Jett.[51] She contributed a cover of Rufus's \"Tell Me Something Good\" to the soundtrack of the film Happy Feet, and lent her name to PlayStation to promote the PSP, a special pink edition of which was released.[52]\nPink collaborated with several other artists in 2006 and 2007, when she opened for Justin Timberlake on the American leg of his FutureSex/LoveShow Tour. She sang on the Indigo Girls album Despite Our Differences. She was featured on India.Arie's song \"I Am Not My Hair\" from the Lifetime Television film Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy. She wrote a song, \"I Will\", for Natalia's third album, Everything and More. \"Outside of You\", another song she co-wrote, was recorded by dance-pop singer Hilary Duff and released on her 2007 album Dignity. Pink recorded a song with Annie Lennox and twenty-two other female acts for Lennox's fourth solo studio album, Songs of Mass Destruction; titled \"Sing\", it was written as an anthem for HIV/AIDS, according to Lennox's website.[53] In December 2007, a special edition Pink Box, which comprises her second to fourth albums and the DVD Live in Europe, was released in Australia. It reached the top twenty on the albums chart and was certified Gold, selling over 35,000 units.[54]\nOn August 7, 2008, Pink's single \"So What\" was leaked online, and radio stations across Australia were quick to give it massive airplay. Less than six hours after the leak, \"So What\" was voted No.1 on Nova 100 Melbourne and shot to No.1 on the Today Network's national radio Hot30 Countdown.[55] On August 22, Pink announced a new track, titled \"Crystal Ball\". On September 18, 2008, \"So What\" became her second number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100.[56] Pink was the guest of honor at the 2008 ARIA Music Awards, which were held in Sydney, Australia, in October 2008. There she sang \"So What\". On November 3, 2008, Funhouse debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA charts. In Australia it sold over 86,000 units in its first week, and was eventually certified eleven times platinum.[57]\nOn November 23, 2008, Pink performed \"Sober\", the second single from Funhouse, at the American Music Awards. The third single was \"Please Don't Leave Me\", with a video directed by Dave Meyers.

I didn't speak to my mother for a year, because I was sure she adopted me.\"[138] She stated, \"Madonna has always been an inspiration for me... I was a fan right from the first time I heard 'Holiday'.\"[139] Pink also won her first talent show singing Madonna's \"Oh Father\".[140] Of Janis Joplin, Pink said \"She was so inspiring by singing blues music when it wasn't culturally acceptable for white women, and she wore her heart on her sleeve. She was so witty and charming and intelligent, but she also battled an ugly-duckling syndrome. I would love to play her in a movie.\"[139] In a tribute performance on her Try This Tour, Pink called Joplin \"a woman who inspired me when everyone else ... didn't!\"[141]\n\nAs a child, she admired the leader of 4 Non Blondes, Linda Perry, whom she would later track down and form a close relationship with on her second album. She said: \"Literally this woman spoke to me. Being in pain and being on drugs and being misunderstood and, yeah she spoke my language. Without having to say anything, she could sing a note and it was what I was feeling. I used to sit at three or four o' clock in the morning, tripping on whatever, screaming 4 Non Blondes out the window until the cops were called\".[142] Other influences for Pink include Joan Jett, Mary J. Blige, Billy Joel, and Whitney Houston.[143][144]\nThroughout her career, she has received applause from critics for her powerful vocals.[145][146][147][148] Her voice has been described as \"raspy\", \"husky\", and \"distinctive.\"[149] James Montgomery of MTV calls her \"a deceptively good singer ... who can out-sing almost anyone\".[148] The Guardian describes her voice as \"prodigious\".[150] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times labelled her as \"a powerhouse vocalist\".[151] Pink has also received acclaim for her \"raw\", \"soulful\" voice and her ability to emote. The Inquirer defined her voice as \"husky\" and \"gutsy\", further complimenting her for developing into a \"powerfully emotive vocalist\", while comparing her to Janis Joplin.[152] The Star Tribune commends her by writing, \"Her slightly raspy, slightly soulful voice made you feel the dysfunction in 'Family Portrait', the longing of 'Who Knew' and the empowerment in 'Perfect'.\"[153] CNN has said that Pink is known for singing \"with the right level of emotion\".[154] Fellow pop artist Kelly Clarkson believes that Pink's voice is \"the best of our generation\".[155]\nAside from her music, Pink has been noted for her fashion style, such the \"adventurous\" hairstyles she has worn, which have included fluorescent spikes to pink-streaked dreadlocks to a pitch-black skater cut.[156] Regarding her style, she told InStyle, \"I'm eclectic. I'm a tomboy, but I'm kind of a hippie and kind of a gangster [...] I don't know if that's a good thing, but it is my thing.\"[156]\nPink is an animal-rights activist and a prominent campaigner for PETA, contributing her voice toward causes such as the protest against KFC.[157] In conjunction with PETA, she criticized the Australian wool industry over its use of mulesing. In January 2007, she stated that she had been misled by PETA about mulesing and that she had not done enough research before lending her name to the campaign.[158] Her campaigning led to a headlining concert called PAW (Party for Animals Worldwide) in Cardiff, Wales on August 21, 2007.[159] In 2015, she posed nude for PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\", campaign.[160]\nPink is also outspoken about LGBT rights and supports same-sex marriage.[161] In October 2012, Pink told The Advocate that she does not define her sexuality saying, \"I never felt the need to.\"[162]\nPink is also involved with several charities, including Human Rights Campaign, ONE Campaign, Prince's Trust, New York Restoration Project, Run for the Cure Foundation, Save the Children, Take Back the Night, UNICEF and World Animal Protection.[163] As of May 2008, Pink has been officially recognized as an advocate for the RSPCA in Australia. On February 16, 2009, Pink announced she was donating $250,000 to the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal to aid the victims of the bushfires that swept through the Australian state of Victoria earlier that month.[164] Pink stated that she wanted to make \"a tangible expression of support\".[165] Pink also donated money to Autism Speaks.[166]\nIn August 2012, Pink became a spokesmodel for CoverGirl, featuring in a fall 2013 advertising campaign themed \"beauty with an edge\".[167]\nOn August 21, 2018, Pink stopped her concert in Brisbane for a grieving fan. A girl named Leah lost her mother one month prior to the concert, and she and her family hung up signs all around the concert, saying \"My name is Leah \u2013 I'm 14 years old. I lost my beautiful Mum last month. I would LOVE a hug\u2026 Please!\". The signs grabbed the attention of Pink.[168]\nPink has been credited for breaking boundaries and pushing the envelope throughout her career. She is regarded as the \"most trailblazing artist\" of her pop generation.[151][169] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times says, \"Pink stood up for her music, broke the music industry's mold and scored a breakout hit, challenging a school of teen singers to find their own sounds as well.\" He adds, \"[Pink] also started a race among other teen pop stars like Christina Aguilera to add substance to their own sound.\"[170] Ann Powers refers to her as a \"powerhouse vocalist\", stating her mix of rebellion, emotional rawness, humor, and \"infectious\" dance beats created \"a model for the mashup approach of latter-day divas such as Katy Perry, Kesha, and even Rihanna.\"[151] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone commented: \"I think people respond to her sense of independence and dedication. It inspires people... This is a prolific pop artist who is sometimes famous and successful, sometimes obscure, who nonetheless keeps making her own kind of music.\"[151]\nJames Montgomery of MTV describes her as \"a fabulously fearless pop artist\" who can \"out-sing almost anyone out there. She can out-crazy Gaga or Lily. She's the total pop-star package, everything you'd want in a singer/entertainer/icon. And still, she remains oddly off the radar. Such is the price of busting borders\".[169] Entertainment Weekly said: \"She essentially invented the whole modern wave of Pop Diva Domination: You can draw a straight line from \"Get This Party Started\" to Katy Perry, Kesha, pre-messianic Lady Gaga, and post-weird Rihanna.\"[171] Glamour Magazine wrote: \"When Pennsylvania-born Alecia Moore debuted in 2000, pop was dominated by long-locked blonds like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. Pink changed the game. Without her, the last 13 years of big-voiced, tough chick music is hard to imagine.\"[172][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nFollowing her performance at the American Music Awards of 2012, LZ Granderson of CNN wrote: \"... our culture's biggest sin may well be the auto-tuned syrup we've allowed to dominate the pop charts. All-time chart records are handed to vacuous acts such as the Black Eyed Peas and singing awards are given to vocal lightweights such as Taylor Swift [...] But thank God for Pink. [...]  While Christina Aguilera has a tendency to oversing, Britney Spears can't sing, and Lauryn Hill sorta stopped singing, Pink has managed to carve a brilliant 13-year career by being something that is incredibly rare these days\u2014an artist.\"[173]British soul singer Adele considers Pink's performance at Brixton Academy in London as one of \"the most defining moments\" in her life, saying \"It was the Missundaztood record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live. I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible.\"[174][175]\nPink's work has inspired several other artists including Demi Lovato,[176] Kelly Clarkson,[177] Taylor Swift,[178] Katy Perry,[179] Tegan and Sara,[180] Ashley Tisdale,[181] Alessia Cara,[182] Victoria Justice,[183] Adele,[184] Julia Michaels,[185] Ben Hopkins of Pwr Bttm[186] and Dua Lipa.[187]\nPink met professional motocross racer Carey Hart at the 2001 X Games in Philadelphia. Following a brief separation in 2003, Pink proposed to Hart in June 2005 during a Mammoth Lakes motocross race; she was \"assisting\" in his race and wrote \"Will You Marry Me? I'm serious!\" on a pit board. He initially didn't notice and continued on for another lap. When he did notice later, he veered off the track to accept right then. She then made him finish the race.[188][189] They married in Costa Rica on January 7, 2006.[190]\nAfter months of speculation, Pink announced in February 2008, that she and Hart had separated.[191][192] Hart subsequently appeared in the video for her 2008 song \"So What\",[193]  which deals with their separation.[194] The couple sought marriage counseling during their separation[195]  in hopes of reconciliation.[196]  In February 2010, Pink confirmed that she and Hart were back together.[197] Hart also appears with Pink in the music video for her songs \"Just Give Me a Reason\", \"True Love\", and \"Just like Fire\".[198][199]\nIn November 2010, Pink announced on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she and Hart were expecting their first child.[200] In June 2011, she gave birth to their daughter, Willow Sage.[201] In December 2016, she gave birth to their second child, a son, Jameson Moon.[202][203]\nPink is a supporter of attachment parenting.[204]\nIn 2010, she appeared on Forbes' \"The Celebrity 100\" list at #27, with earnings of $44 million.[205] In 2011, she appeared on Forbes' The Top-Earning Women in Music list at #6 with earnings of $22 million, with an average of $1 million per show on the road.[206] In 2009, Billboard put her at the 6th place on their \"Money Makers\" list, listing her earnings as $36,347,658.[207] In 2013, she appeared on Forbes' list of \"Highest Paid Musicians\", with the earnings of $32 million.[208] In 2018, she appeared on Forbes' list of \"Highest Paid Female Celebrities\", with the earnings of $52 million.[209]\nAccording to Nielsen SoundScan, Pink's record sales stand at 16 million copies in the United States.[210] Pink has sold over 40 million albums and 50 million singles worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists.[3]\n</body></html>"

He is the lead singer for the pop rock band Maroon 5. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Levine began his musical career in 1994, when he co-founded the band Kara's Flowers, of which he was the lead vocalist and guitarist. The band split up after their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), which did not gain popularity. In 2001, the group was reformed \u2013 with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up \u2013 and began a new musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released five more albums: It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012), V (2014), and Red Pill Blues (2017). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and a World Music Award. From 2011 to 2019, Levine served as a coach on NBC's reality talent show The Voice and won three times with a member of his team (seasons 1, 5, and 9). In 2012, Levine made his acting debut as a recurring character Leo Morrison in American Horror Story: Asylum, the second season of the series American Horror Story. Levine also appeared in the films Begin Again (2013), Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016), Fun Mom Dinner and The Clapper (both 2017). As an entrepreneur, Levine launched his own eponymous fragrance line in 2013. The same year, he collaborated with K-Mart and ShopYourWay.com to develop his menswear collection. He also owns a record label, 222 Records, and a production company, 222 Productions (which the latter produced Sugar and Songland, respectively). In 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that \"sources familiar with his many business dealings\" estimated Levine would earn more than $35\u00a0million that year.[6] Adam Noah Levine[7] was born in Los Angeles on March 18, 1979,[8] to Fredric Levine, the founder of retail chain M.

He chose not to have a Bar Mitzvah as a child because of the custom of receiving Bar Mitzvah gifts, explaining: \"I felt as though a lot of kids were trying to cash in ... I just don't think it's the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs and years and years and years of cultural heritage.\"[12] Levine is a nephew of journalist and author Timothy Noah, television producer and writer Peter Noah,[13][14] and economist Jordan Levine.[15] Levine's parents divorced when he was seven. Growing up, Levine spent weekdays with his mother and weekends with his father.[12] He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce but called it a \"waste of time\", explaining that his parents could not \"accept the fact that I might have been OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and all the things you do when you find out. A few days later I was fine but I still had to go to therapy.\"[16] Levine describes his family as \"very musical\"[17] and credits his mother with \"start[ing] me out on the path.\"[18] He also attributes his mother's idols \u2013 Simon & Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac, and The Beatles \u2013 to shaping his musical style, calling them \"a huge part of my upbringing\".[12] Levine attended Brentwood School, where he met Jesse Carmichael and Mickey Madden, his future bandmates.[19] He carried his musical interests to high school, where he states he was \"a little rebellious. I didn't want to do the things they were teaching me ... [music] consumed my every thought.\"[17] Levine used hallucinogenic drugs in his adolescence. In an interview with Q, he said that using mushrooms \"really forced me to look at myself\" but added that he had never abused drugs.[20][21] On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he stated that he stopped using prescription drugs after his first experience with prescription drug Ambien, which left him unconscious for an hour.[22] In February 1994, Levine, along with Mickey Madden, Jesse Carmichael, and Ryan Dusick, another Brentwood High student, formed garage band Kara's Flowers.[23][24] In 1995, the group played their first gig at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood, California, with Levine on vocals and guitar.[25] The band was discovered while they were performing at a beach party in Malibu by independent producer Tommy Allen. Allen, along with his partner John DeNicola, had the band record an 11-track album.[25] Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles, they were signed on to Reprise Records through producer Rob Cavallo.[26] In August 1997, the band released their first album, titled The Fourth World.[27] That same year, the band appeared on an episode of the drama series Beverly Hills, 90210.[6] After their graduation, the band toured in support of their debut. Despite high expectations,[25] the album had little success, selling about 5,000 copies,[28] and its only single, \"Soap Disco\", failed commercially. Finally, on Cavallo's exit from the label,[25] Reprise decided to drop the band.[29] Disappointed with the results of their album, the band broke up.[30][31] Later, Levine would say of the experience: \"Kara's Flowers was just floating up the wall beneath the sticks. Make a record quickly, put it out. No touring base, no nothing. Just try to make it happen right out of the gate and it just doesn't work\".[32] After the break up of Kara's Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles to pursue further studies at Five Towns College in New York.[25][33] On MTV News, in 2002, he said: \"That's when I started waking up to the whole hip-hop, R&B thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was not Brentwood High\".[34] After dropping out of Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York, where he and Jesse Carmichael spent a semester,[35] they reunited with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form a band once more.[36] They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre.[19] Levine explained the need for a makeover for the band: \"We were just so sick of being a typical rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration.\"[25] The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman, and David Boxenbaum.[31] Following Berkman's advice, the band added a fifth member, James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine \"seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer [Levine], so he could be the star I perceived him to be\".[28] Around this time, Adam Noah Levine had been working as a writer's assistant on the CBS television show Judging Amy, whose producer Barbara Hall was his family friend.[6] While on the show, he would spend time writing songs about his ex-girlfriend Jane Herman. These songs were put into Maroon 5's debut album Songs About Jane, which was released in June 2002. The album slowly gained airplay, and eventually became a sleeper hit, selling an estimated 10 million copies[37] and becoming the tenth best-selling album of 2004, two years after its release.[38] In 2005, Maroon 5 won their first Grammy Award, for Best New Artist.[39] The next year, they won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the second Songs About Jane single \"This Love\".[40] By 2006, the band started recording once again, and in May 2007, Maroon 5's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long was released. Levine described the album as \"a vast improvement\", explaining: \"I think this record is a little more self-confident and powerful lyrically\".[41] To support the album, the band performed on a \"six-date club tour\" in which they visited small venues in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, and New York City in early June 2007.[42] The album and its lead, third and penultimate singles (\"Makes Me Wonder\", \"Won't Go Home Without You\" and \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", respectively) each received Grammy nominations, although only \"Makes Me Wonder\" secured a win.[43][44] After winding down from a world tour in support It Won't Be Soon Before Long, the band began recording in Switzerland in 2009, in collaboration with record producer and songwriter Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. Levine said Lange \"worked me harder than anyone ever has\".[45] In 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album, Hands All Over. The album did not initially meet expectations. In an interview with Los Angeles Times, Levine explained that the album suffered from being \"all these disparate ideas and songs that didn't make any sense together\".[46] After the moderate success of the album's first three singles, the band released \"Moves like Jagger\" which Levine classified as \"one of those songs that was definitely a risk; it's a bold statement\".[47] The single became a worldwide success; it was the ninth-best-selling digital single of 2011 with sales of 8.5\u00a0million copies and, as of 2012[update], the eighth-best-selling digital single of all time. Levine later credited the song with \"totally reviving the band\".[46] Since \"Moves Like Jagger\" was the first time Maroon 5 had collaborated with an outside writer, the band decided to attempt it again on their next album, entitled Overexposed.[48] Its title is supposedly an allusion to Levine's public ubiquity. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he opined that is their most dance-driven album ever, commenting: \"It's very much an old-fashioned disco tune. I have a love/hate relationship with it \u2013 but mostly I love it\".[49] The album and its lead single \"Payphone\" gave Maroon 5 their second Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance nominations.[44] In support of Overexposed, the band conducted the Overexposed Tour from 2012\u201313 (with the European leg extending to 2014 due to scheduling conflicts),[50] and also headlined the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour, which included The Voice contestant Tony Lucca.[51] In 2014, Maroon 5 continued their collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Max Martin and others to release their fifth studio album V (pronounced: \"five\"). Levine acknowledged that they followed the same song-writing process that they tried with Overexposed, saying: \"We developed a really nice system on the last record \u2014 we found songs we were passionate about, developed them and put our stamp on them [...] this time we kept it going but looked for different types of songs.\"[52] Five singles were released from it. In support of the album, the band undertook the Maroon V Tour, which kicked off with a show in Dallas in February 2015.[53] In 2007, Levine had stated that he believed Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding.[54] He was quoted explaining: \"Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond\". But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:\"I love what I do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [but] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon\".[55] He has also turned down the idea of having a solo career, stating that \"there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band\".[56] On February 10, 2017, Levine received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the recording industry.[57] On December 1, 2018, Levine was honoured as Hitmaker of the Year from Variety's Hitmakers.[58] Levine has collaborated with several musical artists. In 2005, he was featured on the song \"Live Again\" by hip-hop duo Ying Yang Twins.[59] The same year, he appeared on Kanye West's album Late Registration, on the third single \"Heard 'Em Say\",[60] a collaboration Levine called \"very pure and very easy\". The song was created during an airplane flight that he and West shared,[61] and its refrain was later used for the Maroon 5 song \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" from It Won't Be Soon Before Long. He also appeared on Alicia Keys' third album Alicia Keys: MTV Unplugged, as part of the cover of The Rolling Stones song \"Wild Horses\".[62] Around the same time, he featured on fellow Octone Records singer K'naan's single \"Bang Bang\". In 2009, he recorded \"Gotten\", a song for Slash's first solo album Slash (2010).[63] In February 2010, he was among approximately 80 musicians who sang on the charity-single remake of \"We Are the World\", called \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\".[64] In 2011, he appeared on the Gym Class Heroes song, \"Stereo Hearts\". Levine also worked with hip-hop artist 50 Cent on his song \"My Life\", recording the vocals almost two years before it was released as a single in 2012, which included rapper Eminem.[65] In 2013, Levine wrote a song with Swedish composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson called \"My Most Terrible Secret\" by the cast of Community, in the episode from the television series \"Intro to Felt Surrogacy\".[66] In 2015, Levine was featured on the song \"Painkiller\" by Rozzi Crane and the duo, R. City's single \"Locked Away\". In 2016, Levine collaborated with The Lonely Island for the song \"I'm So Humble\", on the soundtrack album Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, which they also appeared in the film of the same name.[67] In 2019, Levine collaborated with American actor and musician Joe Pesci, on his third album Pesci... Still Singing, with two songs \"Baby Girl\" and a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"My Cherie Amour\".[68] He is also featured as a singer for his band's song \"She Will Be Loved\" in the music rhythm game, Band Hero.[69] Levine has contributed with two songs for the soundtracks of the John Carney films: \"Lost Stars\" in Begin Again and \"Go Now\" in Sing Street. Levine has made four notable comic appearances on television. During 2007, he appeared in the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live in an SNL Digital Short called Iran So Far, performing with Andy Samberg, Fred Armisen and Jake Gyllenhaal. Levine played himself while singing a humorous bridge to a \"love song\" for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.[70] In 2008, he performed on Comedy Central's \"Night of Too Many Stars\". He also had a cameo on Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the night of stars and endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election. In 2013, he hosted Saturday Night Live and featured alongside Kendrick Lamar on Lonely Island's digital short \"YOLO\", which parodies the acronym for \"You Only Live Once.\"[71] His hosting was generally disliked by reviewers, who called it \"mediocre\"[72] and \"subpar.\"[73] \u2014Levine on how he hoped The Voice would change public perception about him.[74] In 2011, Levine has served as a contestant judge/coach on the reality talent television show, The Voice.[75] The contestants of his team named Team Adam, who won in the series are Javier Colon (season 1), Tessanne Chin (season 5)[76] and Jordan Smith (season 9). The Voice has been credited with reviving Maroon 5's \"faltering\" career after the sub-par sales of Hands All Over as well as increasing Levine's popularity. According to polling firm E-Poll Market Research, awareness of Levine has nearly tripled since he joined the show. He has also been described as the \"breakout\" star of the series, with #TeamAdam and @AdamLevine scoring a respective 203,000 and 2.14\u00a0million Twitter mentions in the show's third season, higher than all the other coaches. In 2013, The Hollywood Reporter estimated that Levine was paid $10\u201312\u00a0million for each season of The Voice.[6] In May 2019, Levine left the series after sixteen seasons and eight years since his debut in 2011.[77] In 2012, Levine appeared as a recurring character in American Horror Story: Asylum, the second season of the television series American Horror Story.[78] He plays Leo Morrison, a newly-wed photographer visiting modern-day Briarcliff Manor, an insane asylum, on honeymoon with his wife, played by Jenna Dewan. The scenes were shot around his band's summer touring schedule. In an interview with E!, he said of his role: \"It sounded like so much fun and that's why I wanted to do it ... this sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley\".[79][80] However, he admitted to not being a fan of the show nor horror genre in general, stating he didn't watch the episodes because \"it's just so weird and disturbing\".[81] In June 2012, Levine was cast in the musical romance-drama film Begin Again (originally titled Can a Song Save Your Life?). The film was directed by John Carney and had Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo play the lead roles. In it, he plays Dave Kohl, Knightley's songwriting partner and former boyfriend of five years, who leaves her behind on finding success in the music industry.[82][83][84] The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival to generally favorable reviews from critics.[85] In November 2013, Levine was named People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive, becoming the first singer and the second non-actor (after John F. Kennedy, Jr.) to claim the title.[86] He was ranked No. 41 on Glamour's \"Sexiest Men of 2012\" list.[87] In 2008, he appeared on People's \"Single and Sexy Men\" list.[88] He was elected TV's Most Crushworthy Male Reality Host/Judge in a poll held by Zap2it.[89] In April 2012, Shalom Life ranked him Number 7 on its list of \"Top 50 Hottest Jewish men in the world\".[90] Levine stripped naked for testicular cancer awareness for a centerfold in Cosmopolitan UK's February 2011 issue.[91] Levine and Josh Gummersall started a production company 222 Productions and the first project was Sugar (2018), a YouTube Premium web television series which was inspired by the music video for the Maroon 5 song of the same name. It follows music artists to crash events for unsuspecting fans.[92] The company produced a reality competition series Songland, which premiered on NBC on May 28, 2019, where Levine served as executive producer. In October 2008, Levine collaborated with First Act to create the First Act 222 Guitar, which was fashioned to his specifications. The guitar was sold via Target stores.[93] Two years later he launched his own fashion line, entitled \"222\", at the Project Trade Show in Las Vegas. The collection features jeans, basic T-shirts and leather jackets. The venture was organized in partnership with his father, Fred Levine (who operates a chain of specialty boutiques), and his cousin, Sami Cooper.[94][95] In June 2011, Levine took part in an educational campaign to raise awareness of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The project, titled \"Own It\", was created by Shire and organized in collaboration with the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA), Children and Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (CHADHD). The project targets people who were previously diagnosed with the disorder, focusing on how it may continue into adulthood. Levine, who himself was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager, said: \"This campaign is important to me because it can help young adults and adults realize that there's a chance they may still have ADHD if they had it as a kid\".[96][97] In connection to this, he wrote an article in ADDitude Magazine about his personal experience with it.[98] Levine founded his own record label, 222 Records in February 2012. He stated that he was inspired to start the label to sign on Rozzi Crane, an USC music student he discovered through a mutual friend.[99] She became the first singer signed on to the label, followed by Glee actor Matthew Morrison and The Voice season 2 contestant and part of Team Adam, the singer Tony Lucca. It was reported that he was negotiating further with potential distributors, as well as organizing staff, to operate as a full-fledged record company with departments such as marketing, radio and publicity.[100][101] In September 2012, Levine collaborated with the clothing company Bench in the Philippines to launch the menswear collection, following the company's similar partnership with Pretty Little Liars actress Lucy Hale and musician Joe Jonas.[102] In January 2013, Levine was announced he would be entering a partnership with Sears Holdings to launch a multi-department lifestyle brand to develop apparel and accessories collections.[103] The company, also included rapper Nicki Minaj in the same contract. The menswear collection was launched on October 1 that year and conducts business via Kmart stores and online.[104] In an official statement, Levine said: \"Partnering with ShopYourWay to develop this line was an exciting opportunity for me and I am really looking forward to diving into the process of designing an apparel and accessory collection\".[105] In an interview with People, he commented further, \"it was cool that they really promoted creative control. I like to be involved with process rather than just phoning it in\".[106] Later, Levine collaborated with ID Perfumes to create his debut eponymous scent.[107] The line was launched at the Premiere Fragrance Installation in Los Angeles in February 2013.[108] The fragrance range, consisting of scents for both for men and women, is sold through Macy's department stores in microphone-shaped bottles. Speaking at its launch, Levine said: \"The task was to make something that I would wear. So that was a process and we finally came to a great conclusion and it smells great\"[109][110] The fragrance garnered media attention for contradicting his tweet the previous year, in which he said that he wanted to \"put an official ban on celebrity fragrances. Punishable by death from this point forward\".[111] Levine's interest in music started at around ten years of age, when he first started playing the guitar. He found music as an outlet for his feelings, stating: \"I picked up a guitar and that was it. I fell so madly in love with it, it's all I did\".[17] He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but he was so nervous that he played with his back to the audience.[6][112] Throughout his childhood, he had a wide range of musical influences, including The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, by Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye[113] and Michael Jackson.[114] He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music.[115] In an interview with Billboard, he explained the diversity of his influences: \"I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine, sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the '70s\".[116] Levine remembers that listening to \"Are You That Somebody?\" by Aaliyah convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of the band he was performing with at the time, Kara's Flowers.[27] His move to New York introduced him to a new music scene that involved hip-hop, R&B, gospel and soul music.[34] He took to changing his musical style, extensively emulating Stevie Wonder.[115] Subsequently, Songs About Jane was released, deemed \"bluesy funk\"[117] and similar to the sound of English pop rock band Busted.[118] Critics also drew comparisons between Levine and Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay.[119] While earlier work was deemed \"vaguely funky white-soul\"[119] and \"rock\", recent ones have been judged to have a more reggae, anthemic pop sound,[120] evoking comparisons to Coldplay.[121] Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: \"There's so much variety in music, it's silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way\".[115] He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: \"Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't figured out a way to use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing.\"[27] He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a Rolling Stone interview: \"I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach\".[34] Levine is a tenor, he has a 3 and a half octave vocal range[122][123] and has been noted for his falsettos.[124] Salon wrote: \"When he's crooning come-ons, his voice lends the music a satisfying lewdness, a sense of sticky physicality that gives his snaky hooks a pheromonal urgency.\"[125] In a review of It Won't Be Soon Before Long, Entertainment Weekly described his vocals as \"smug, R&B-slick deadpan ... there's a twisted logic to his dispassionate delivery\".[126] In another review, Allmusic wrote \"he knows that he's a pop guy, somewhat in the tradition of Hall & Oates, but he isn't trying to be retro, he's ... making records that are melodic, stylish, and soulful\".[127] In a review of the 2013 Honda Civic Tour, The Boston Globe also commented positively on his on-stage presence, which \"exude[s] a sense of up-for-anything playfulness ... combined with a rock solid work ethic and a clear love for their audiences and performing\".[128] Levine's popularity outside of his musical work has seen him tagged as a \"stand-alone star,\"[129] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music.[130] Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved.[131] Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: \"Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks in no small part to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining\".[132] Delta Sky described him as \"a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man\".[133] He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: \"We talked about it a long time ago and decided I would step out, for us, not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman.\"[56] In early 2010, while performing at the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue release party in Las Vegas, Levine met Russian Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover-model Anne Vyalitsyna. They began a relationship.[134] Two years later Vyalitsyna and Levine decided to separate in an \"amicable and supportive manner\", thereby ending the relationship in April 2012.[135] A month after their separation, Levine began dating Behati Prinsloo, a Namibian Victoria's Secret model, in May 2012.[136][137] The couple married on July 19, 2014, with Jonah Hill officiating the wedding.[138][139] Levine and Prinsloo have two daughters, Dusty Rose (born September 21, 2016)[140] and Gio Grace (born February 15, 2018).[141] Levine practices yoga under instructors Alanna Zabel[142] and Chad Dennis. He has stated that \"yoga will drastically improve you in every way imaginable\".[143] He began the practice as a way to relieve his back pain and eventually replaced his weightlifting with yoga.[143] Levine, whose brother Michael openly identifies as gay, is a supporter of same-sex marriage and LGBT rights.[144] In 2011, he made a video[145] on Maroon 5's official YouTube account in support of the It Gets Better Project. In January 2012, he announced that Maroon 5 had changed the location of their post-Grammy Awards show because of the \"unnamed Los Angeles restaurant's backing of Proposition 8\".[144] In 2013, Levine was mentioned in a hostile work environment lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by an unnamed security guard who claimed that Universal Music Publishing Group's Santa Monica location was \"infiltrated with pervasive drug use where you could smell marijuana seeping from various offices and openly used in common areas, and lounges\". The guard claimed that when she complained about the cannabis smoke coming from one of the studios, she was told that \"it's Adam Levine ... if he wants to come to the lobby and do a line of cocaine on the floor, it's OK\". In an official statement to The Hollywood Reporter, UMPG described the allegations as \"absurd\".[146][147]",

He is the lead singer for the pop rock band Maroon 5. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Levine began his musical career in 1994, when he co-founded the band Kara's Flowers, of which he was the lead vocalist and guitarist. The band split up after their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), which did not gain popularity. In 2001, the group was reformed \u2013 with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up \u2013 and began a new musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released five more albums: It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012), V (2014), and Red Pill Blues (2017). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and a World Music Award.\nFrom 2011 to 2019, Levine served as a coach on NBC's reality talent show The Voice and won three times with a member of his team (seasons 1, 5, and 9). In 2012, Levine made his acting debut as a recurring character Leo Morrison in American Horror Story: Asylum, the second season of the series American Horror Story. Levine also appeared in the films Begin Again (2013), Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016), Fun Mom Dinner and The Clapper (both 2017). As an entrepreneur, Levine launched his own eponymous fragrance line in 2013. The same year, he collaborated with K-Mart and ShopYourWay.com to develop his menswear collection. He also owns a record label, 222 Records, and a production company, 222 Productions (which the latter produced Sugar and Songland, respectively). In 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that \"sources familiar with his many business dealings\" estimated Levine would earn more than $35\u00a0million that year.[6]\nAdam Noah Levine[7] was born in Los Angeles on March 18, 1979,[8] to Fredric Levine, the founder of retail chain M. Fredric, and Patsy (n\u00e9e Noah) Levine, an admissions counselor.[6][9] He has a brother Michael, two half-siblings\u2014Sam and Liza Levine\u2014and step-sister Julia Bartolf Milne.[citation needed] Levine's father and maternal grandfather were Jewish, while his maternal grandmother was a Protestant.[10] Levine considers himself Jewish,[11] though according to The Jewish Chronicle, he is spiritual but not religious. He chose not to have a Bar Mitzvah as a child because of the custom of receiving Bar Mitzvah gifts, explaining: \"I felt as though a lot of kids were trying to cash in ... I just don't think it's the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs and years and years and years of cultural heritage.\"[12] Levine is a nephew of journalist and author Timothy Noah, television producer and writer Peter Noah,[13][14] and economist Jordan Levine.[15]\nLevine's parents divorced when he was seven. Growing up, Levine spent weekdays with his mother and weekends with his father.[12] He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce but called it a \"waste of time\", explaining that his parents could not \"accept the fact that I might have been OK with it. I cried my eyes out and kicked and screamed and said, 'Why?' and all the things you do when you find out. A few days later I was fine but I still had to go to therapy.\"[16]\nLevine describes his family as \"very musical\"[17] and credits his mother with \"start[ing] me out on the path.\"[18] He also attributes his mother's idols \u2013 Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac, and The Beatles \u2013 to shaping his musical style, calling them \"a huge part of my upbringing\".[12] Levine attended Brentwood School, where he met Jesse Carmichael and Mickey Madden, his future bandmates.[19] He carried his musical interests to high school, where he states he was \"a little rebellious. I didn't want to do the things they were teaching me ... [music] consumed my every thought.\"[17]\nLevine used hallucinogenic drugs in his adolescence. In an interview with Q, he said that using mushrooms \"really forced me to look at myself\" but added that he had never abused drugs.[20][21] On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he stated that he stopped using prescription drugs after his first experience with prescription drug Ambien, which left him unconscious for an hour.[22]\nIn February 1994, Levine, along with Mickey Madden, Jesse Carmichael, and Ryan Dusick, another Brentwood High student, formed garage band Kara's Flowers.[23][24] In 1995, the group played their first gig at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood, California, with Levine on vocals and guitar.[25] The band was discovered while they were performing at a beach party in Malibu by independent producer Tommy Allen. Allen, along with his partner John DeNicola, had the band record an 11-track album.[25] Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles, they were signed on to Reprise Records through producer Rob Cavallo.[26] In August 1997, the band released their first album, titled The Fourth World.[27] That same year, the band appeared on an episode of the drama series Beverly Hills, 90210.[6] After their graduation, the band toured in support of their debut. Despite high expectations,[25] the album had little success, selling about 5,000 copies,[28] and its only single, \"Soap Disco\", failed commercially. Finally, on Cavallo's exit from the label,[25] Reprise decided to drop the band.[29] Disappointed with the results of their album, the band broke up.[30][31] Later, Levine would say of the experience: \"Kara's Flowers was just floating up the wall beneath the sticks. Make a record quickly, put it out. No touring base, no nothing. Just try to make it happen right out of the gate and it just doesn't work\".[32]\nAfter the break up of Kara's Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles to pursue further studies at Five Towns College in New York.[25][33] On MTV News, in 2002, he said: \"That's when I started waking up to the whole hip-hop, R&amp;B thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was not Brentwood High\".[34] After dropping out of Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York, where he and Jesse Carmichael spent a semester,[35] they reunited with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form a band once more.[36] They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre.[19] Levine explained the need for a makeover for the band: \"We were just so sick of being a typical rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration.\"[25]  The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman, and David Boxenbaum.[31] Following Berkman's advice, the band added a fifth member, James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine \"seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer [Levine], so he could be the star I perceived him to be\".[28]\nAround this time, Adam Noah Levine had been working as a writer's assistant on the CBS television show Judging Amy, whose producer Barbara Hall was his family friend.[6] While on the show, he would spend time writing songs about his ex-girlfriend Jane Herman. These songs were put into Maroon 5's debut album Songs About Jane, which was released in June 2002. The album slowly gained airplay, and eventually became a sleeper hit, selling an estimated 10 million copies[37] and becoming the tenth best-selling album of 2004, two years after its release.[38] In 2005, Maroon 5 won their first Grammy Award, for Best New Artist.[39] The next year, they won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the second Songs About Jane single \"This Love\".[40]\nBy 2006, the band started recording once again, and in May 2007, Maroon 5's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long was released. Levine described the album as \"a vast improvement\", explaining: \"I think this record is a little more self-confident and powerful lyrically\".[41] To support the album, the band performed on a \"six-date club tour\" in which they visited small venues in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, and New York City in early June 2007.[42] The album and its lead, third and penultimate singles (\"Makes Me Wonder\", \"Won't Go Home Without You\" and \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", respectively) each received Grammy nominations, although only \"Makes Me Wonder\" secured a win.[43][44]\nAfter winding down from a world tour in support It Won't Be Soon Before Long, the band began recording in Switzerland in 2009, in collaboration with record producer and songwriter Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. Levine said Lange \"worked me harder than anyone ever has\".[45] In 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album, Hands All Over. The album did not initially meet expectations. In an interview with Los Angeles Times, Levine explained that the album suffered from being \"all these disparate ideas and songs that didn't make any sense together\".[46] After the moderate success of the album's first three singles, the band released \"Moves like Jagger\" which Levine classified as \"one of those songs that was definitely a risk; it's a bold statement\".[47] The single became a worldwide success; it was the ninth-best-selling digital single of 2011 with sales of 8.5\u00a0million copies and, as of 2012[update], the eighth-best-selling digital single of all time. Levine later credited the song with \"totally reviving the band\".[46]\nSince \"Moves Like Jagger\" was the first time Maroon 5 had collaborated with an outside writer, the band decided to attempt it again on their next album, entitled Overexposed.[48] Its title is supposedly an allusion to Levine's public ubiquity. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he opined that is their most dance-driven album ever, commenting: \"It's very much an old-fashioned disco tune. I have a love/hate relationship with it \u2013 but mostly I love it\".[49] The album and its lead single \"Payphone\" gave Maroon 5 their second Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance nominations.[44] In support of Overexposed, the band conducted the Overexposed Tour from 2012\u201313 (with the European leg extending to 2014 due to scheduling conflicts),[50] and also headlined the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour, which included The Voice contestant Tony Lucca.[51]\nIn 2014, Maroon 5 continued their collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Max Martin and others to release their fifth studio album V (pronounced: \"five\"). Levine acknowledged that they followed the same song-writing process that they tried with Overexposed, saying: \"We developed a really nice system on the last record \u2014 we found songs we were passionate about, developed them and put our stamp on them [...] this time we kept it going but looked for different types of songs.\"[52] Five singles were released from it. In support of the album, the band undertook the Maroon V Tour, which kicked off with a show in Dallas in February 2015.[53]\nIn 2007, Levine had stated that he believed Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding.[54] He was quoted explaining: \"Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond\". But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:\"I love what I do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [but] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon\".[55] He has also turned down the idea of having a solo career, stating that \"there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band\".[56]\nOn February 10, 2017, Levine received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the recording industry.[57] On December 1, 2018, Levine was honoured as Hitmaker of the Year from Variety's Hitmakers.[58]\nLevine has collaborated with several musical artists. In 2005, he was featured on the song \"Live Again\" by hip-hop duo Ying Yang Twins.[59] The same year, he appeared on Kanye West's album Late Registration, on the third single \"Heard 'Em Say\",[60] a collaboration Levine called \"very pure and very easy\". The song was created during an airplane flight that he and West shared,[61] and its refrain was later used for the Maroon 5 song \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" from It Won't Be Soon Before Long. He also appeared on Alicia Keys' third album Alicia Keys: MTV Unplugged, as part of the cover of The Rolling Stones song \"Wild Horses\".[62] Around the same time, he featured on fellow Octone Records singer K'naan's single \"Bang Bang\". In 2009, he recorded \"Gotten\", a song for Slash's first solo album Slash (2010).[63] In February 2010, he was among approximately 80 musicians who sang on the charity-single remake of \"We Are the World\", called \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\".[64] In 2011, he appeared on the Gym Class Heroes song, \"Stereo Hearts\".

In 2013, he hosted Saturday Night Live and featured alongside Kendrick Lamar on Lonely Island's digital short \"YOLO\", which parodies the acronym for \"You Only Live Once.\"[71] His hosting was generally disliked by reviewers, who called it \"mediocre\"[72] and \"subpar.\"[73]\n\u2014Levine on how he hoped The Voice would change public perception about him.[74]\nIn 2011, Levine has served as a contestant judge/coach on the reality talent television show, The Voice.[75] The contestants of his team named Team Adam, who won in the series are Javier Colon (season 1), Tessanne Chin (season 5)[76] and Jordan Smith (season 9). The Voice has been credited with reviving Maroon 5's \"faltering\" career after the sub-par sales of Hands All Over as well as increasing Levine's popularity. According to polling firm E-Poll Market Research, awareness of Levine has nearly tripled since he joined the show. He has also been described as the \"breakout\" star of the series, with #TeamAdam and @AdamLevine scoring a respective 203,000 and 2.14\u00a0million Twitter mentions in the show's third season, higher than all the other coaches. In 2013, The Hollywood Reporter estimated that Levine was paid $10\u201312\u00a0million for each season of The Voice.[6] In May 2019, Levine left the series after sixteen seasons and eight years since his debut in 2011.[77]\nIn 2012, Levine appeared as a recurring character in American Horror Story: Asylum, the second season of the television series American Horror Story.[78] He plays Leo Morrison, a newly-wed photographer visiting modern-day Briarcliff Manor, an insane asylum, on honeymoon with his wife, played by Jenna Dewan. The scenes were shot around his band's summer touring schedule. In an interview with E!, he said of his role: \"It sounded like so much fun and that's why I wanted to do it ... this sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley\".[79][80] However, he admitted to not being a fan of the show nor horror genre in general, stating he didn't watch the episodes because \"it's just so weird and disturbing\".[81]\nIn June 2012, Levine was cast in the musical romance-drama film Begin Again (originally titled Can a Song Save Your Life?). The film was directed by John Carney and had Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo play the lead roles. In it, he plays Dave Kohl, Knightley's songwriting partner and former boyfriend of five years, who leaves her behind on finding success in the music industry.[82][83][84] The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival to generally favorable reviews from critics.[85]\nIn November 2013, Levine was named People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive, becoming the first singer and the second non-actor (after John F. Kennedy, Jr.) to claim the title.[86] He was ranked No. 41 on Glamour's \"Sexiest Men of 2012\" list.[87] In 2008, he appeared on People's \"Single and Sexy Men\" list.[88] He was elected TV's Most Crushworthy Male Reality Host/Judge in a poll held by Zap2it.[89] In April 2012, Shalom Life ranked him Number 7 on its list of \"Top 50 Hottest Jewish men in the world\".[90] Levine stripped naked for testicular cancer awareness for a centerfold in Cosmopolitan UK's February 2011 issue.[91]\nLevine and Josh Gummersall started a production company 222 Productions and the first project was Sugar (2018), a YouTube Premium web television series which was inspired by the music video for the Maroon 5 song of the same name. It follows music artists to crash events for unsuspecting fans.[92] The company produced a reality competition series Songland, which premiered on NBC on May 28, 2019, where Levine served as executive producer.\nIn October 2008, Levine collaborated with First Act to create the First Act 222 Guitar, which was fashioned to his specifications. The guitar was sold via Target stores.[93] Two years later he launched his own fashion line, entitled \"222\", at the Project Trade Show in Las Vegas. The collection features jeans, basic T-shirts and leather jackets. The venture was organized in partnership with his father, Fred Levine (who operates a chain of specialty boutiques), and his cousin, Sami Cooper.[94][95]\nIn June 2011, Levine took part in an educational campaign to raise awareness of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The project, titled \"Own It\", was created by Shire and organized in collaboration with the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA), Children and Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (CHADHD). The project targets people who were previously diagnosed with the disorder, focusing on how it may continue into adulthood. Levine, who himself was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager, said: \"This campaign is important to me because it can help young adults and adults realize that there's a chance they may still have ADHD if they had it as a kid\".[96][97] In connection to this, he wrote an article in ADDitude Magazine about his personal experience with it.[98]\nLevine founded his own record label, 222 Records in February 2012. He stated that he was inspired to start the label to sign on Rozzi Crane, an USC music student he discovered through a mutual friend.[99] She became the first singer signed on to the label, followed by Glee actor Matthew Morrison and The Voice season 2 contestant and part of Team Adam, the singer Tony Lucca. It was reported that he was negotiating further with potential distributors, as well as organizing staff, to operate as a full-fledged record company with departments such as marketing, radio and publicity.[100][101]\nIn September 2012, Levine collaborated with the clothing company Bench in the Philippines to launch the menswear collection, following the company's similar partnership with Pretty Little Liars actress Lucy Hale and musician Joe Jonas.[102] In January 2013, Levine was announced he would be entering a partnership with Sears Holdings to launch a multi-department lifestyle brand to develop apparel and accessories collections.[103] The company, also included rapper Nicki Minaj in the same contract. The menswear collection was launched on October 1 that year and conducts business via Kmart stores and online.[104] In an official statement, Levine said: \"Partnering with ShopYourWay to develop this line was an exciting opportunity for me and I am really looking forward to diving into the process of designing an apparel and accessory collection\".[105] In an interview with People, he commented further, \"it was cool that they really promoted creative control. I like to be involved with process rather than just phoning it in\".[106]\nLater, Levine collaborated with ID Perfumes to create his debut eponymous scent.[107] The line was launched at the Premiere Fragrance Installation in Los Angeles in February 2013.[108] The fragrance range, consisting of scents for both for men and women, is sold through Macy's department stores in microphone-shaped bottles. Speaking at its launch, Levine said: \"The task was to make something that I would wear. So that was a process and we finally came to a great conclusion and it smells great\"[109][110] The fragrance garnered media attention for contradicting his tweet the previous year, in which he said that he wanted to \"put an official ban on celebrity fragrances. Punishable by death from this point forward\".[111]\nLevine's interest in music started at around ten years of age, when he first started playing the guitar. He found music as an outlet for his feelings, stating: \"I picked up a guitar and that was it. I fell so madly in love with it, it's all I did\".[17] He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but he was so nervous that he played with his back to the audience.[6][112] Throughout his childhood, he had a wide range of musical influences, including The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, by Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye[113] and Michael Jackson.[114] He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music.[115] In an interview with Billboard, he explained the diversity of his influences: \"I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine, sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the '70s\".[116]\nLevine remembers that listening to \"Are You That Somebody?\" by Aaliyah convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of the band he was performing with at the time, Kara's Flowers.[27] His move to New York introduced him to a new music scene that involved hip-hop, R&amp;B, gospel and soul music.[34] He took to changing his musical style, extensively emulating Stevie Wonder.[115] Subsequently, Songs About Jane was released, deemed  \"bluesy funk\"[117] and similar to the sound of English pop rock band Busted.[118] Critics also drew comparisons between Levine and Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay.[119]\nWhile earlier work was deemed \"vaguely funky white-soul\"[119] and \"rock\", recent ones have been judged to have a more reggae, anthemic pop sound,[120] evoking comparisons to Coldplay.[121] Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: \"There's so much variety in music, it's silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way\".[115] He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: \"Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven't figured out a way to use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing.\"[27] He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a Rolling Stone interview: \"I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach\".[34]\nLevine is a tenor, he has a 3 and a half octave vocal range[122][123] and has been noted for his falsettos.[124] Salon wrote: \"When he's crooning come-ons, his voice lends the music a satisfying lewdness, a sense of sticky physicality that gives his snaky hooks a pheromonal urgency.\"[125] In a review of It Won't Be Soon Before Long, Entertainment Weekly described his vocals as \"smug, R&amp;B-slick deadpan ... there's a twisted logic to his dispassionate delivery\".[126] In another review, Allmusic wrote \"he knows that he's a pop guy, somewhat in the tradition of Hall &amp; Oates, but he isn't trying to be retro, he's ... making records that are melodic, stylish, and soulful\".[127] In a review of the 2013 Honda Civic Tour, The Boston Globe also commented positively on his on-stage presence, which \"exude[s] a sense of up-for-anything playfulness ... combined with a rock solid work ethic and a clear love for their audiences and performing\".[128]\nLevine's popularity outside of his musical work has seen him tagged as a \"stand-alone star,\"[129] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music.[130] Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved.[131] Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: \"Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks in no small part to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining\".[132] Delta Sky described him as \"a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man\".[133] He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: \"We talked about it a long time ago and decided I would step out, for us, not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman.\"[56]\nIn early 2010, while performing at the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue release party in Las Vegas, Levine met Russian Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover-model Anne Vyalitsyna. They began a relationship.[134] Two years later Vyalitsyna and Levine decided to separate in an \"amicable and supportive manner\", thereby ending the relationship in April 2012.[135]\nA month after their separation, Levine began dating Behati Prinsloo, a Namibian Victoria's Secret model, in May 2012.[136][137] The couple married on July 19, 2014, with Jonah Hill officiating the wedding.[138][139] Levine and Prinsloo have two daughters, Dusty Rose (born September 21, 2016)[140] and Gio Grace (born February 15, 2018).[141]\nLevine practices yoga under instructors Alanna Zabel[142] and Chad Dennis. He has stated that \"yoga will drastically improve you in every way imaginable\".[143] He began the practice as a way to relieve his back pain and eventually replaced his weightlifting with yoga.[143]\nLevine, whose brother Michael openly identifies as gay, is a supporter of same-sex marriage and LGBT rights.[144] In 2011, he made a video[145] on Maroon 5's official YouTube account in support of the It Gets Better Project. In January 2012, he announced that Maroon 5 had changed the location of their post-Grammy Awards show because of the \"unnamed Los Angeles restaurant's backing of Proposition 8\".[144]\nIn 2013, Levine was mentioned in a hostile work environment lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by an unnamed security guard who claimed that Universal Music Publishing Group's Santa Monica location was \"infiltrated with pervasive drug use where you could smell marijuana seeping from various offices and openly used in common areas, and lounges\". The guard claimed that when she complained about the cannabis smoke coming from one of the studios, she was told that \"it's Adam Levine ... if he wants to come to the lobby and do a line of cocaine on the floor, it's OK\". In an official statement to The Hollywood Reporter, UMPG described the allegations as \"absurd\".[146][147]\n</body></html>"

I still need space and time to heal.\"[255]\nLovato is an active supporter of LGBT rights. When the Defense of Marriage Act was struck down in June 2013, she tweeted: \"Gay, straight, lesbian, bi.\u00a0... No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality.\"[256] Lovato later said: \"I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, and I still have a lot of faith.\"[257]\nOn December 23, 2011, Lovato posted a message on Twitter criticizing her former network for airing episodes of Shake It Up and So Random! in which characters joked about eating disorders. Disney Channel publicity officials quickly took action, apologizing to Lovato and removing the episodes from the network's broadcast and video on demand sources after additional criticism (following Lovato's post) on the network's public-relations account.[258]\nLovato identifies as a feminist.[259]\nLovato spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia about raising awareness for mental health,[260] and also performed at the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence rally in Washington, D.C. in March 2018.[261][262]\nIn October 2019, Lovato attended a free trip to Israel provided by the Ministry of Jerusalem Affairs and private donors[263], where she was baptised in the Jordan River. After posting pictures on Instagram, she immediately received backlash due to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, but later insisted that it was meant to be a spiritual experience, not a political statement.[264]\nIn May 2009, Lovato was named an Honorary Ambassador of Education by the American Partnership For Eosinophilic Disorders.[265] As part of her involvement with Disney's Friends for Change, Lovato, the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez recorded the initiative's theme song (\"Send It On\") in 2009. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 20,[56][266] and its proceeds were directed to environmental charities through the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund.[55] Lovato and Joe Jonas recorded another song, \"Make a Wave\", for the charity in March 2010.[71] She is also spokesperson for the Join the Surge Campaign!, DoSomething.Org and Joining the Surge by Clean &amp; Clear; the latter is a national campaign encouraging teenagers to take action in their communities.[267]\nLovato was featured in a January 2010 public-service announcement for Voto Latino to promote the organization's \"Be Counted\" campaign preparing for the 2010 United States Census.[268] In October 2010 she was the spokeswoman for the anti-bullying organization, PACER.[269] Lovato participated in the \"A Day Made Better\" school advocacy campaign[270] and has supported DonateMyDress.org, Kids Wish Network, Love Our Children USA, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and City of Hope.[271] In April 2012 she became a contributing editor of Seventeen magazine, describing her personal struggles to its female teenage audience.[240] She became a spokesperson for the anti-bullying organization PACER and appeared on America's Next Top Model to speak out against bullying.[272]\nIn October Lovato was named the ambassador of Mean Stinks, a campaign focused on eliminating bullying by girls.[273] In May 2013 she was cited for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental-health problems at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in Washington.[274] In late June 2013 Lovato announced the creation of the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program, named for her late father, to pay treatment costs for mentally-ill patients.[232] In August 2013, she traveled to Kenya for her 21st birthday to participate in a program of the international charity organization Free the Children.[275]\nIn May 2014, Lovato was named the LA Pride Parade Grand Marshal and the lead performer for NYC Pride Week for her contribution to the LGBT community. NYC Pride spokesperson Patti Diluigi said, \"Demi Lovato is an amazing role model for today's youth, both LGBT and non-LGBT, for her activism in the area of equality, positive messaging on body image, and level of openness with her struggles. As a community, we're fortunate to have an ally like Demi.\"[276] Lovato has also become the face of Human Rights Campaign's America's for Marriage Equality. For the announcement of the campaign, Lovato stated \"Whether you're LGBT or straight, your love is valid, beautiful and an incredible love. So let's protect love and strengthen the institution of marriage by allowing loving, caring and committed same-sex couples to legally marry. Please join me and the majority of American citizens who support marriage equality.\"[277] On April 2, 2016, Lovato received the GLAAD Vanguard Award for making a significant difference in promoting equal rights for the LGBT community at the 27th GLAAD Media Awards ceremony.[278]\nAs of September\u00a02015[update], Lovato's name appears on the \"Unclaimed Coogan\" list, which is a fund for child actors whose earnings were partially withheld, but which remain unclaimed by the former child performers.[279]\nIn June 2016, Lovato was among the artists that signed an open letter to stop gun violence, created by Billboard.[280] That month, the Human Rights Campaign also released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Lovato and others told the stories of the people killed there.[281][282]\nIn January 2017, Lovato returned to Kenya to participate in working with We Movement to do work with women and children.[283] In March 2017, as a celebration of five-year anniversary of sobriety, Lovato donated money to Los Angeles-based charities, randomly selecting a group of causes based on their work, which included animal, LGBT and adoption rights.[284][285] On March 22, Lovato will be honored with the Artistic Award of Courage at The Jane and Terry Semel Institute's biannual Open Mind Gala, which recognizes those who raise awareness and reduce the stigma of mental health issues.[286]\nLovato partnered with Fabletics in May 2017 on limited edition activewear collection.[287] The collaboration was in support of the United Nations Foundation's Girl Up campaign to fund programs \"for some of the world's most marginalized adolescent girls.\"[288][289] On September 23, 2017, Lovato was named a Global Citizen ambassador for championing the mental health of thousands of children displaced within Iraq and other communities.

                "text": "no title\n\nAvril Ramona Lavigne (/\u02cc\u00e6vr\u026al l\u0259\u02c8vi\u02d0n/ AV-ril l\u0259-VEEN, French:\u00a0[av\u0281il lavi\u0272]; born September 27, 1984)[1] is a Canadian-French singer, songwriter, and actress. By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain and by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more than $2\u00a0million. Her debut studio album, Let Go (2002), emphasized a skate punk persona that has earned her the title \"Pop Punk Queen\", from critics and music publications, due to her achievement and impact in the industry.[2][3] Lavigne is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music.[4][5] Since her professional debut, Lavigne has sold more than 40\u00a0million albums and over 50\u00a0million singles worldwide, making her the third-best-selling Canadian female artist of all time, behind Celine Dion and Shania Twain.[6][7] Lavigne's breakthrough single, \"Complicated\", reached number one in several countries worldwide and made her the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album in the United Kingdom. Her second studio album, Under My Skin (2004), became Lavigne's first album to reach the top of the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide. The Best Damn Thing (2007), Lavigne's third studio album, reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single \"Girlfriend\", which became her first single to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Goodbye Lullaby (2011) and Avril Lavigne (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories.[8][9][10] In February 2019, Lavigne released her sixth studio album, Head Above Water, through BMG. In addition to music, Lavigne voiced Heather, a Virginia opossum, in the animated film Over the Hedge (2006), and made her screen acting debut in Fast Food Nation (2006). Lavigne was born in 1984 at Belleville, Ontario, Canada. She was named \"Avril\" by her father[11] after the French word for the month of April. He and Lavigne's mother recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang \"Jesus Loves Me\" on the way home from church.[12] Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle,[13] both of whom teased her when she sang. \"My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying.\"[12] She is the sister-in-law of Japanese band One OK Rock bassist Ryota Kohama.[14] Lavigne's paternal grandfather Maurice Yves Lavigne was born in Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Quebec.[15] A member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, he married Lucie Dzierzbicki, a French native of Morhange, in France in 1953. Their son, Jean-Claude Lavigne was born in 1954 at RCAF Station Grostenquin near Grostenquin, Lorraine, France.[16] When Jean-Claude was a child, the family moved to Ontario, Canada, and in 1975, he married Judith-Rosanne \"Judy\" Loshaw.[17][18] When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to Greater Napanee, Ontario,[19] a town with a population of approximately 5,000.[20][21][22] In school, she was sometimes kicked out of class for misbehaving. Her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Center in Kingston, Ontario, where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.[23] Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks, and Shania Twain. She began writing her own songs. Her first song was called \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\", about a teenage crush, which she described as \"cheesy cute\".[24] Lavigne also played hockey into high school and won MVP twice as a right winger in a boys league.[25] In 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with the Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people.[26][19][20] Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, \"What Made You Say That\",[19] and Lavigne told Twain that she was going to be \"a famous singer\".[20] During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, \"Touch the Sky\", for his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit. She later sang on \"Temple of Life\" and \"Two Rivers\" for his follow-up album, My Window to You, in 2000. In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston, Ontario.[19][20] Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives.[27] Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, Nettwerk, received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement.[28] Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer Peter Zizzo during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song \"Why\". Lavigne was noticed by Arista Records during a trip to New York.[27] In November 2000,[21] Ken Krongard, an A&R representative, invited Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition \"so impressed\" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25\u00a0million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.[22][19] By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed skateboarding, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career.[21][29][24] Lavigne's band was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the Canadian punk rock scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.[30] Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told HitQuarters that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with The Matrix production team\u2014including \"Complicated\", later released as her debut single\u2014that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording of Lavigne's debut album, Let Go, finished in January 2002.[31] Lavigne released Let Go in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK\u2014this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time.[32] By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and Let Go the top-selling debut of the year.[33] By May 2003, Let Go had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association.[34] By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide.[35] By March 2018, the RIAA certified the album seven-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over seven million units in the US.[36] Lavigne's debut single, \"Complicated\", peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US. \"Complicated\" was one of the bestselling Canadian singles of 2002, and one of the decade's biggest hits in the US,[37] where subsequent singles \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm with You\" reached the top ten.[citation needed] With these three singles, Lavigne became the second artist in history to have three top-ten songs from a debut album on Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 chart.[38] Lavigne was named Best New Artist (for \"Complicated\") at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards,[39] won four Juno Awards in 2003 out of six nominations,[40] received a World Music Award for \"World's Bestselling Canadian Singer\", and was nominated for eight Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for \"Complicated\".[41] In 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video for \"Hundred Million\" by the pop punk band Treble Charger.[42] In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine,[17] and in May she performed \"Fuel\" during MTV's Icon tribute to Metallica.[43][44] During her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, Lavigne covered Green Day's \"Basket Case\".[45] Lavigne's second studio album, Under My Skin, was released in May 2004 and debuted at number one in Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US.[46] The album was certified five-times Platinum in Canada[47] and has sold 10 million copies,[48] including 3.2\u00a0million in the US.[49] Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, and Kreviazuk's husband, Our Lady Peace front man Raine Maida, co-produced the album with Butch Walker and Don Gilmore. Lavigne said that Under My Skin proved her credentials as a songwriter, saying that \"each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much[sic] emotions in those songs\".[50] \"Don't Tell Me\", the lead single off the album, reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia. \"My Happy Ending\", the album's second single, was a top five hit in the UK and Australia. In the US, it was a top ten entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a number-one pop radio hit. The third single, \"Nobody's Home\", did not manage to make the top 40 in the US and performed moderately elsewhere. During early 2004 Lavigne went on the 'Live and By Surprise' acoustic mall tour in the US and Canada to promote Under My Skin, accompanied by her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld. In late 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the year-long Bonez Tour. Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004, for 'World's Best Pop/Rock Artist' and 'World's Bestselling Canadian Artist', and won three Juno Awards from five nominations in 2005, including 'Artist of the Year'.[51] She also won in the category of 'Favorite Female Singer' at the eighteenth annual Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.[52] Lavigne co-wrote the song \"Breakaway\", which was recorded by Kelly Clarkson for the soundtrack to the 2004 film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement.[53] \"Breakaway\" was released as a single in mid 2004 and subsequently included as the title track on Clarkson's second album, Breakaway. Lavigne performed the Goo Goo Dolls song \"Iris\" with the band's lead singer John Rzeznik at Fashion Rocks in September 2004,[54] and she posed for the cover of Maxim in October 2004.[55] She recorded the theme song for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (released in November 2004) with producer Butch Walker.[56] In February 2006, Lavigne represented Canada at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics.[57] Fox Entertainment Group approached Lavigne to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film Eragon; her contribution, \"Keep Holding On\", was released as a single to promote the film and its soundtrack.[58][59][60] Lavigne's third album, The Best Damn Thing, was released in April 2007 and debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200,[61] and subsequently achieved Platinum status in Canada.[47] The album sold more than 2\u00a0million copies in the US.[36] Its lead single, \"Girlfriend\", became Lavigne's first number-one single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and one of the decade's biggest singles.[61][62] The single also peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and Japan, and reached number two in the UK and France. As well as English, \"Girlfriend\" was recorded in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Mandarin. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked \"Girlfriend\" as the most-downloaded track worldwide in 2007, selling 7.3\u00a0million copies, including the versions recorded in eight different languages.[63][64] \"When You're Gone\", the album's second single, reached the top five in Australia and the United Kingdom, the top ten in Canada, and the top forty in the US. \"Hot\" was the third single and charted only at number 95 in the US, although it reached the top 10 in Canada and the top 20 in Australia. Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2007, for 'World's Bestselling Canadian Artist' and 'World's Best Pop/Rock Female Artist'. She won her first two MTV Europe Music Awards, received a Teen Choice Award for 'Best Summer Single', and was nominated for five Juno Awards.[51] In December 2007, Lavigne was ranked number eight in Forbes magazine's list of 'Top 20 Earners Under 25', with annual earnings of $12\u00a0million.[65] In March 2008, Lavigne undertook a world tour, The Best Damn World Tour, and appeared on the cover of Maxim for the second time.[66] In mid-August, Malaysia's Islamic opposition party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, attempted to ban Lavigne's tour show in Kuala Lumpur, judging her stage moves \"too sexy\". It was thought that her concert on August 29 would promote wrong values ahead of Malaysia's independence day on August 31.[67] On August 21, 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government.[68] In January 2010, Lavigne worked with Disney clothing designs inspired by Tim Burton's feature film Alice in Wonderland. She recorded a song for its soundtrack, \"Alice\", which was played over the end credits and included on the soundtrack album Almost Alice.[69][70][71] In February, Lavigne performed at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony.[72] Lavigne's song \"I'm with You\" was sampled by Rihanna on the track \"Cheers (Drink to That)\", which is featured on Rihanna's fifth studio album, Loud (2010).[73][74] \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" was released as a single the following year, and Lavigne appeared in its music video.[75] In December 2010, American singer Miranda Cosgrove released \"Dancing Crazy\", a song written by Lavigne, Max Martin and Shellback. It was also produced by Martin.[76] Lavigne began recording for her fourth studio album, Goodbye Lullaby, in her home studio in November 2008, its opening track, \"Black Star\", was written to help promote her first fragrance of the same name.[77][78] Lavigne described the album as being about her life experiences rather than focusing on relationships, and its style as less pop rock than her previous material, reflecting her age.[78][79] The release date for Goodbye Lullaby was delayed several times, which Lavigne said was because of her label.[80][81] Goodbye Lullaby was released in March 2011,[82][79] and its lead single, \"What the Hell\", premiered in December 2010.[82] Goodbye Lullaby received Juno Award nominations for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year.[51] By March 2018, Goodbye Lullaby sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA.[36] Three months after the release of Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne announced that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, describing it as the musical opposite of Goodbye Lullaby[83] and \"pop and more fun again\".[84][85][86] In late 2011, she confirmed that she had moved to Epic Records, headed by L. A. Reid.[87][88] Lavigne contributed two cover songs to the 2012 Japanese animated film One Piece Film: Z: \"How You Remind Me\" (originally by Nickelback) and \"Bad Reputation\" (originally by Joan Jett).[89] The lead single from Lavigne's fifth studio album, \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" (produced by Martin Johnson of the band Boys Like Girls), was released in April 2013[90] and reached top 20 positions on the Billboard Hot 100, Australia and the UK. The second single, \"Rock n Roll\", was released in August 2013[91] and the third, \"Let Me Go\" (featuring Lavigne's then-husband Chad Kroeger of Nickelback), was released in October 2013. The album, titled Avril Lavigne, was released in November 2013; in Canada, it was certified gold and received a Juno Award nomination for Pop Album of the Year.[92][93] The fourth and last single from Avril Lavigne, \"Hello Kitty\", was released in April 2014. The music video sparked controversies over racism claims.[94] During mid 2014, Lavigne opened for boy band the Backstreet Boys' In a World Like This Tour and played at the music festival Summer Sonic in Tokyo, Japan.[93][95] She released a music video for \"Give You What You Like\", a song from her self-titled album on February 10, 2015. The song is featured in Lifetime's made-for-TV movie, Babysitter\u2019s Black Book.[96] By March 2018, the album sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA.[36] In an April 2015 interview with Billboard, Lavigne announced a new single titled \"Fly\", which was released on April 26 in association with the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.[97] Lavigne features in the song \"Listen\" from Japanese rock band One Ok Rock's eighth studio album, Ambitions, released on January 11, 2017.[98] Lavigne also features in the song \"Wings Clipped\" by Grey with Anthony Green for the duo's debut EP Chameleon, released on September 29, 2017.[99] Lavigne's sixth studio album Head Above Water was released on February 15, 2019, through BMG.[100][101] The album reached the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number thirteen on the U.S. Billboard 200. It was preceded by three singles: \"Head Above Water\", \"Tell Me It's Over\", and \"Dumb Blonde\".[102][103][104] The fourth single, \"I Fell in Love with the Devil\", was released on June 28, 2019.[105] Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video \"Nobody's Home\" involved the most \"acting\".[106] Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,[107] performing \"Sk8er Boi\"[108] with her band in a nightclub.[109] She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film Going the Distance. The main characters bump into her backstage at the MuchMusic Video Awards[110] after her performance of \"Losing Grip\".[111] She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico[112] to film a single scene in the 2007 film, The Flock.[113] She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.[113] On her role in The Flock, Lavigne said, \"I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast\".[106] The Flock was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7\u00a0million in the foreign box office.[114] Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, \"All the actors went in individually, and [director] Tim and [screenwriter Karey] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.\"[115] Lavigne found the recording process to be \"easy\" and \"natural\", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. \"I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.\" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. \"[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude\".[106] The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38\u00a0million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336\u00a0million worldwide.[116] In December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in Fast Food Nation, based on the book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal.[117] The fictionalized adaptation, directed by Richard Linklater, traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.[118] Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.[119][120] The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2\u00a0million worldwide.[121] Both Over the Hedge and Fast Food Nation opened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the \"right parts and the right movies.\" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. \"I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.\"[106] In August 2006, Canadian Business magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.[122] In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line Abbey Dawn, featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by Kohl's, which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.[123][124] Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a \"juniors lifestyle brand\",[64] which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and \"hot pinks and blacks\". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. \"I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.\"[125] The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, \"after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career\".[75] The designs were also featured on the Internet game Stardoll, where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.[126] On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the New York Fashion Week,[127] returning in 2011.[75] In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.[128][129] \"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find.\"[72] Lavigne released her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.[130] When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, \"I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are.\"[131] Black Star won the 2010 Best \"Women's Scent Mass\" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).[132] Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, Forbidden Rose, which took two years to develop.[133] It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.[134] Its message is an extension of Black Star's \"follow your dreams\",[135] though the tagline for the new perfume is \"Dare to Discover\".[136] The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting,[135] where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.[136] Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010.[129] The tagline for the fragrance is \"Dare to discover more\".[137] It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.[138] In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate Alice in Wonderland-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing.[71] Her designs were exhibited at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in California beginning in May through September, alongside Colleen Atwood's costumes from the 2010 film.[139] Lavigne possesses a light-lyric soprano vocal range.[140] Themes in her music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view.[141] Lavigne believes her \"songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true.\"[106] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as \"Losing Grip\", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as \"Complicated\", saying that \"the songs I did with the Matrix\u00a0... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore.\"[142] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that \"I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about\u00a0... Like boys, like dating or relationships\".[143] Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nu metal,[144][145][146][147] which anticipated the emotional intensity and theatrical aesthetics of emo-pop music before it came into the mainstream.[148] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. \"Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through.\"[149] Her objective in writing the album was simply to \"make it fun\".[150] The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs.[151] Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records,[77] with Lavigne describing the album as \"more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional\".[129] Ian McKellen defined her as \"a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian\" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.[152][153] During the 2000's decade most critics and publications, have identified Lavigne's first three albums as a mix of pop punk, alternative rock and pop rock[154][155][156][157][158][159][160] influenced by a post-grunge sound.[161][162][163][155][164][165] Later on the 2010s, her sound went softer and poppier characterized more for acoustic pop-rock songs and less loud grungy guitar-driven songs that were signature of her earlier works.[166] While Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said \"I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me\", adding that she had been writing \"full-structured songs\" since she was 14.[50] Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles \"Complicated\", \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm with You\". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that \"[N]one of those songs aren't from me\".[142] In 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism[167] and criticized her songwriting, saying that \"Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything.\"[168] Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for \"clear defamation\" against her character.[169] Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that \"Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her.\"[167] Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" for her song \"Girlfriend\".[170] Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, \"me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a Sum 41 song. It's the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos.\"[169] In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.[171] Lavigne's earlier influences came from country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain;[142][24] and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia and Janis Joplin.[143] By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk and punk rock acts such as blink-182, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind and Matchbox Twenty.[172][173][174][175][176][177][178] Because of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, \"It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest\".[179] Lavigne commented on the matter: \"I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel\u00a0... punk, and I am so not any of them.\"[50] However, she has also said that her music has punk influences: \"I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do.\"[172][180] In 2003, Lavigne won an International Achievement Award for the song \"Complicated\" at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.[181] Lavigne received eight Grammy Awards nominations in two years, including Best New Artist. She has also received three American Music Awards nominations, one Brit Award nomination, and one MTV Video Music Award. She has received a total of 221 awards and 301 nominations. By 2013, Lavigne had sold more than 50 million singles and 40\u00a0million copies of her albums worldwide,[182] becoming one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the US, with over 12.4\u00a0million copies certified by the RIAA.[183] In 2009, Billboard named Lavigne the number 10 pop artist in the \"Best of the 2000s\" chart.[184] She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in the US.[185][181] Lavigne holds a Guinness World Record as being the youngest female solo artist to top the UK album chart, on January 11, 2003, at the age of 18 years and 106 days. The album Let Go reached number one in its 18th chart week.[186] She also was the first to reach 100 million views on a YouTube video, with her 2007 single \"Girlfriend\".[187] Lavigne was the first western artist to do a full tour in China, with The Best Damn Tour in 2008; and is considered the biggest western artist in Asia, especially in Japan where her first three albums have sold more than 1 million copies, being the only Female Western Artist since the 2000s to achieve it.[188] Lavigne is the only artist to have performed on three different multi-sport events, such as two closing ceremonies of Winter Olympic Games (Torino 2006[189] and Vancouver 2010[190]) and in the opening ceremony of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.[191] Lavigne is considered a highlight in the pop-punk and alternative pop-rock scene since she helped to paved the way for the success of female-driven punk-influenced pop music, such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Courage My Love and Hey Monday.[192][193][194][195][196][197] She has been compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair and Courtney Love and earned a reputation as the greatest female representative of pop-punk music, and has been called one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music.[198][5][199][200] Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style.[201][202] \"Sk8er Boi\", \"He Wasn't\" and \"Girlfriend\" are frequently listed among the best pop-punk songs of all time by critics.[203][204][205][206][207] The singer's influences extend beyond rock and pop to include acts such as Aly & AJ,[208] Busted,[209] Billie Eilish,[210] Hilary Duff,[211] Rob Halford (Judas Priest),[212] Courage My Love,[213] Grey,[214] Ed Sheeran,[215] Miley Cyrus,[216] Vanessa Hudgens, Jessie J,[217] Jonas Brothers,[218] Brie Larson,[219] Lesley Roy,[220] Selena Gomez,[221] Ashley Tisdale,[222] Ariana Grande,[223] Paramore,[224] Amy Studt,[225] Meghan Trainor,[226] Hey Monday, Kelly Osbourne, Amanda Palmer, Misono,[227] YUI,[228] Demi Lovato, Kirstin Maldonado,[229] and PVRIS.[224] Lavigne also has fueled a ferocity influence on indie rock singer-songwriters, such as, Soccer Mommy,[230] Snail Mail and Liz Phair.[231] On the rise of mid-to-late 2010s emo hip hop and emo rap, Lavigne have been noted as an influence of various musicians from that scene, like: Lil Uzi Vert, Princess Nokia, Lloyd Banks, Vic Mensa, Nipsey Hussle, John River, Noname and Rico Nasty. American rapper Fat Tony, explained that Lavigne's traces of influences on hip hop and rap music comes because \"she [Avril] delivered a great visual catchy package [punk music, pop music and skater culture] that describes all of them\". Rico Nasty named one of her alter egos, Trap Lavigne, citing \"She is a perfect representation of being hard and soft [...] she hated the term punk, but she was so punk rock\".[232] Nicki Minaj declared herself a huge fan of Lavigne's music.[233] Lavigne was featured in the 2003 game The Sims: Superstar as a non-playable celebrity.[234] In mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume graphic novel, Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes. She collaborated with artist Camilla d'Errico and writer Joshua Dysart on the manga, which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero, Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, \"I know that many of my fans read manga, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy.\" The first volume was released in April 2007, and the second followed in July 2007. The publication Young Adult Library Services nominated the series for \"Great Graphic Novels for Teens\".[235] In September 2011, Lavigne appeared on the Hub Network televised singing competition Majors & Minors as a guest mentor alongside other singers, including Adam Lambert and Leona Lewis.[75] Lavigne has been involved with many charities, including Make Some Noise, Amnesty International, Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Special Olympics, Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields, US Campaign for Burma, Make-A-Wish Foundation and War Child. She has also appeared in ALDO ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of UNICEF on November 28, 2007, at the Bell Centre in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.[236] In November 2010, Lavigne attended the Clinton Global Initiative.[237] Lavigne worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour.[238] She covered \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" for War Child's Peace Songs compilation, and she recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" as her contribution to the compilation album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. Released on June 12, 2007, the album was produced to benefit Amnesty International's campaign to alleviate the crisis in Darfur.[239] On December 5, 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in Mexico City during the biggest charity event in Latin America, \"Teleton\". She performed acoustic versions of her hits \"Complicated\" and \"Girlfriend\" with Evan Taubenfeld and band member, Jim McGorman.[240] In 2010, Lavigne was one of several artists who contributed their voices to a cover of K'naan's \"Wavin' Flag\" as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[241] On September 14, 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, \"The Avril Lavigne Foundation\", which aims to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities[237][242] and works with leading charitable organizations.[128] The foundation partners with the Easter Seals, Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS,[243] Lavigne has worked with the latter two. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, \"I just really wanted to do more\".[242] Lavigne said on the foundation's website, \"I have always looked for ways to give back because I think it's a responsibility we all share\".[244] Philanthropist Trevor Neilson's 12-person firm, Global Philanthropy Group, advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician John Legend.[237] In September 2014, she launched a personal fundraising campaign for Special Olympics as part of her birthday celebration. Proceeds from her \"Team Rockstar\" event helped sponsor athletes from around the world competing in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Los Angeles.[245][246] According to an ABILITY Magazine interview with Lavigne, the athletes were the stars of the music video for \"Fly\", which was shot in Canada.[247] When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her tomboyish style,[248] in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations.[249][250] She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses,[72] wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers.[23] During photo shoots, instead of wearing \"glittery get-ups\", she preferred wearing \"old, crumpled T's\".[21] In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the \"pop punk princess\"[251][252] and the female answer to Blink-182.[253] Press and fans regarded her as the \u201canti-Britney\u201d, in part because of her less commercial and \"real\" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. \"I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not.\"[23] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was \"wearing a costume\".[22] Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career.[254] Lavigne eventually took on a more gothic style as she began her second album, Under My Skin, trading her skating outfits for black tutus[252] and developing an image marked by angst.[255] During The Best Damn Thing years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits,[256] including \"tight jeans and heels\",[72] and modelled for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar.[248] Lavigne defended her new style: \"I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all\u00a0... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on\".[256] Lavigne has been the subject of a conspiracy theory that states that she committed suicide in 2003, and was replaced by a body double who had previously been recruited to distract paparazzi. This originated as a joke on a Brazilian blog, but has since been embraced by some theorists.[257] In an interview with Australia's KIIS 106.5 in November 2018, Lavigne responded to the rumour, calling it \"weird\".[258] Only a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends.[72] Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate Ben Moody's identical tattoo.[259] In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter \"D\" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley.[72][260] Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday.[72] In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.[261] Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos of the word \"fuck\" on their ribs.[262][263] Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an \"Abbey Dawn\" on her left forearm and an \"XXV\" and star on her right. Although she confirmed the \"fuck\" tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her \"favorite word\"[72]) she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot.[264] She added that she eventually wanted to get a \"big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name\u00a0... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life.\"[72] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, \"Brody\", tattooed beneath her right breast.[265] The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.[266] Lavigne has been legally French from birth, because her father is French and France applies jus sanguinis.[267] She applied for her French passport and received it in February 2011.[268] In January 2012, Lavigne's house in Bel-Air, on the market since May 2011,[269] sold, and Lavigne moved to Paris to study the French language. She rented an apartment and attended a Berlitz school.[270][271] Lavigne and Sum 41 lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley began dating when Lavigne was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17.[272] In June 2005, Whibley proposed to her.[273] The couple married on July 15, 2006, in Montecito, California. On October 9, 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, \"I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship.\"[272] The divorce was finalized on November 16, 2010.[274] Lavigne started dating The Hills star Brody Jenner in February 2010.[275] After almost two years of dating, the couple split in January 2012.[275] Lavigne began dating fellow Canadian musician Chad Kroeger, frontman of the band Nickelback, in July 2012.[276][277][278][279] The relationship blossomed after they began working together in March 2012 to write and record music for Lavigne's fifth album.[277][280][279] Lavigne and Kroeger became engaged in August 2012, after one month of dating.[280][276] The couple married at the Ch\u00e2teau de La Napoule, a reconstructed medieval castle on the Mediterranean in the South of France, on July 1, 2013 (which is Canada Day), after a year of being together.[279][281] On September 2, 2015, Lavigne announced her separation from Kroeger via her official Instagram account.[282] In April 2015, Lavigne revealed to People magazine that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease after her 30th birthday in 2014.[283] In an interview with Billboard that same month, Lavigne said that she was in the recovery process and that she wanted to increase awareness of the disease.[97] Lavigne is a vegetarian.[284] Current members Former members Headlining tours Promotional tours",

By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain and by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more than $2\u00a0million.\nHer debut studio album, Let Go (2002), emphasized a skate punk persona that has earned her the title \"Pop Punk Queen\", from critics and music publications, due to her achievement and impact in the industry.[2][3] Lavigne is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music.[4][5] Since her professional debut, Lavigne has sold more than 40\u00a0million albums and over 50\u00a0million singles worldwide, making her the third-best-selling Canadian female artist of all time, behind Celine Dion and Shania Twain.[6][7]\nLavigne's breakthrough single, \"Complicated\", reached number one in several countries worldwide and made her the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album in the United Kingdom. Her second studio album, Under My Skin (2004), became Lavigne's first album to reach the top of the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide. The Best Damn Thing (2007), Lavigne's third studio album, reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single \"Girlfriend\", which became her first single to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Goodbye Lullaby (2011) and Avril Lavigne (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories.[8][9][10] In February 2019, Lavigne released her sixth studio album, Head Above Water, through BMG.\nIn addition to music, Lavigne voiced Heather, a Virginia opossum, in the animated film Over the Hedge (2006), and made her screen acting debut in Fast Food Nation (2006).\nLavigne was born in 1984 at Belleville, Ontario, Canada. She was named \"Avril\" by her father[11] after the French word for the month of April. He and Lavigne's mother recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang \"Jesus Loves Me\" on the way home from church.[12] Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle,[13] both of whom teased her when she sang. \"My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying.\"[12] She is the sister-in-law of Japanese band One OK Rock bassist Ryota Kohama.[14]\nLavigne's paternal grandfather Maurice Yves Lavigne was born in Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Quebec.[15] A member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, he married Lucie Dzierzbicki, a French native of Morhange, in France in 1953. Their son, Jean-Claude Lavigne was born in 1954 at RCAF Station Grostenquin near Grostenquin, Lorraine, France.[16] When Jean-Claude was a child, the family moved to Ontario, Canada, and in 1975, he married Judith-Rosanne \"Judy\" Loshaw.[17][18]\nWhen Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to Greater Napanee, Ontario,[19] a town with a population of approximately 5,000.[20][21][22] In school, she was sometimes kicked out of class for misbehaving. Her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Center in Kingston, Ontario, where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.[23] Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks, and Shania Twain. She began writing her own songs. Her first song was called \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\", about a teenage crush, which she described as \"cheesy cute\".[24]  Lavigne also played hockey into high school and won MVP twice as a right winger in a boys league.[25]\nIn 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with the Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people.[26][19][20] Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, \"What Made You Say That\",[19] and Lavigne told Twain that she was going to be \"a famous singer\".[20] During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, \"Touch the Sky\", for his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit. She later sang on \"Temple of Life\" and \"Two Rivers\" for his follow-up album, My Window to You, in 2000.\nIn December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston, Ontario.[19][20] Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives.[27] Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, Nettwerk, received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement.[28] Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer Peter Zizzo during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song \"Why\". Lavigne was noticed by Arista Records during a trip to New York.[27]\nIn November 2000,[21] Ken Krongard, an A&amp;R representative, invited Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition \"so impressed\" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25\u00a0million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.[22][19] By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed skateboarding, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career.[21][29][24] Lavigne's band was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the Canadian punk rock scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.[30]\nReid gave A&amp;R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told HitQuarters that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with The Matrix production team\u2014including \"Complicated\", later released as her debut single\u2014that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording of Lavigne's debut album, Let Go, finished in January 2002.[31]\nLavigne released Let Go in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK\u2014this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time.[32] By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and Let Go the top-selling debut of the year.[33] By May 2003, Let Go had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association.[34] By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide.[35] By March 2018, the RIAA certified the album seven-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over seven million units in the US.[36]\nLavigne's debut single, \"Complicated\", peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US. \"Complicated\" was one of the bestselling Canadian singles of 2002, and one of the decade's biggest hits in the US,[37] where subsequent singles \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm with You\" reached the top ten.[citation needed] With these three singles, Lavigne became the second artist in history to have three top-ten songs from a debut album on Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 chart.[38] Lavigne was named Best New Artist (for \"Complicated\") at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards,[39] won four Juno Awards in 2003 out of six nominations,[40] received a World Music Award for \"World's Bestselling Canadian Singer\", and was nominated for eight Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for \"Complicated\".[41]\nIn 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video for \"Hundred Million\" by the pop punk band Treble Charger.[42] In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine,[17] and in May she performed \"Fuel\" during MTV's Icon tribute to Metallica.[43][44] During her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, Lavigne covered Green Day's \"Basket Case\".[45]\nLavigne's second studio album, Under My Skin, was released in May 2004 and debuted at number one in Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US.[46] The album was certified five-times Platinum in Canada[47] and has sold 10 million copies,[48] including 3.2\u00a0million in the US.[49] Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, and Kreviazuk's husband, Our Lady Peace front man Raine Maida, co-produced the album with Butch Walker and Don Gilmore. Lavigne said that Under My Skin proved her credentials as a songwriter, saying that \"each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much[sic] emotions in those songs\".[50] \"Don't Tell Me\", the lead single off the album, reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia. \"My Happy Ending\", the album's second single, was a top five hit in the UK and Australia. In the US, it was a top ten entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a number-one pop radio hit. The third single, \"Nobody's Home\", did not manage to make the top 40 in the US and performed moderately elsewhere.\nDuring early 2004 Lavigne went on the 'Live and By Surprise' acoustic mall tour in the US and Canada to promote Under My Skin, accompanied by her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld. In late 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the year-long Bonez Tour. Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004, for 'World's Best Pop/Rock Artist' and 'World's Bestselling Canadian Artist', and won three Juno Awards from five nominations in 2005, including 'Artist of the Year'.[51] She also won in the category of 'Favorite Female Singer' at the eighteenth annual Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.[52]\nLavigne co-wrote the song \"Breakaway\", which was recorded by Kelly Clarkson for the soundtrack to the 2004 film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement.[53] \"Breakaway\" was released as a single in mid 2004 and subsequently included as the title track on Clarkson's second album, Breakaway. Lavigne performed the Goo Goo Dolls song \"Iris\" with the band's lead singer John Rzeznik at Fashion Rocks in September 2004,[54] and she posed for the cover of Maxim in October 2004.[55] She recorded the theme song for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (released in November 2004) with producer Butch Walker.[56]\nIn February 2006, Lavigne represented Canada at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics.[57] Fox Entertainment Group approached Lavigne to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film Eragon; her contribution, \"Keep Holding On\", was released as a single to promote the film and its soundtrack.[58][59][60]\nLavigne's third album, The Best Damn Thing, was released in April 2007 and debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200,[61] and subsequently achieved Platinum status in Canada.[47] The album sold more than 2\u00a0million copies in the US.[36] Its lead single, \"Girlfriend\", became Lavigne's first number-one single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and one of the decade's biggest singles.[61][62] The single also peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and Japan, and reached number two in the UK and France. As well as English, \"Girlfriend\" was recorded in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Mandarin. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked \"Girlfriend\" as the most-downloaded track worldwide in 2007, selling 7.3\u00a0million copies, including the versions recorded in eight different languages.[63][64] \"When You're Gone\", the album's second single, reached the top five in Australia and the United Kingdom, the top ten in Canada, and the top forty in the US. \"Hot\" was the third single and charted only at number 95 in the US, although it reached the top 10 in Canada and the top 20 in Australia.\nLavigne won two World Music Awards in 2007, for 'World's Bestselling Canadian Artist' and 'World's Best Pop/Rock Female Artist'. She won her first two MTV Europe Music Awards, received a Teen Choice Award for 'Best Summer Single', and was nominated for five Juno Awards.[51] In December 2007, Lavigne was ranked number eight in Forbes magazine's list of 'Top 20 Earners Under 25', with annual earnings of $12\u00a0million.[65] In March 2008, Lavigne undertook a world tour, The Best Damn World Tour, and appeared on the cover of Maxim for the second time.[66] In mid-August, Malaysia's Islamic opposition party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, attempted to ban Lavigne's tour show in Kuala Lumpur, judging her stage moves \"too sexy\". It was thought that her concert on August 29 would promote wrong values ahead of Malaysia's independence day on August 31.[67] On August 21, 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government.[68]\nIn January 2010, Lavigne worked with Disney clothing designs inspired by Tim Burton's feature film Alice in Wonderland. She recorded a song for its soundtrack, \"Alice\", which was played over the end credits and included on the soundtrack album Almost Alice.[69][70][71] In February, Lavigne performed at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony.[72] Lavigne's song \"I'm with You\" was sampled by Rihanna on the track \"Cheers (Drink to That)\", which is featured on Rihanna's fifth studio album, Loud (2010).[73][74] \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" was released as a single the following year, and Lavigne appeared in its music video.[75] In December 2010, American singer Miranda Cosgrove released \"Dancing Crazy\", a song written by Lavigne, Max Martin and Shellback. It was also produced by Martin.[76]\nLavigne began recording for her fourth studio album, Goodbye Lullaby, in her home studio in November 2008, its opening track, \"Black Star\", was written to help promote her first fragrance of the same name.[77][78] Lavigne described the album as being about her life experiences rather than focusing on relationships, and its style as less pop rock than her previous material, reflecting her age.[78][79] The release date for Goodbye Lullaby was delayed several times, which Lavigne said was because of her label.[80][81] Goodbye Lullaby was released in March 2011,[82][79] and its lead single, \"What the Hell\", premiered in December 2010.[82] Goodbye Lullaby received Juno Award nominations for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year.[51] By March 2018, Goodbye Lullaby sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA.[36]\nThree months after the release of Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne announced that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, describing it as the musical opposite of Goodbye Lullaby[83] and \"pop and more fun again\".[84][85][86] In late 2011, she confirmed that she had moved to Epic Records, headed by L. A. Reid.[87][88] Lavigne contributed two cover songs to the 2012 Japanese animated film One Piece Film: Z: \"How You Remind Me\" (originally by Nickelback) and \"Bad Reputation\" (originally by Joan Jett).[89]\nThe lead single from Lavigne's fifth studio album, \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" (produced by Martin Johnson of the band Boys Like Girls), was released in April 2013[90] and reached top 20 positions on the Billboard Hot 100, Australia and the UK. The second single, \"Rock n Roll\", was released in August 2013[91] and the third, \"Let Me Go\" (featuring Lavigne's then-husband Chad Kroeger of Nickelback), was released in October 2013.\nThe album, titled Avril Lavigne, was released in November 2013; in Canada, it was certified gold and received a Juno Award nomination for Pop Album of the Year.[92][93] The fourth and last single from Avril Lavigne, \"Hello Kitty\", was released in April 2014. The music video sparked controversies over racism claims.[94] During mid 2014, Lavigne opened for boy band the Backstreet Boys' In a World Like This Tour and played at the music festival Summer Sonic in Tokyo, Japan.[93][95] She released a music video for \"Give You What You Like\", a song from her self-titled album on February 10, 2015. The song is featured in Lifetime's made-for-TV movie, Babysitter\u2019s Black Book.[96] By March 2018, the album sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA.[36]\nIn an April 2015 interview with Billboard, Lavigne announced a new single titled \"Fly\", which was released on April 26 in association with the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.[97]\nLavigne features in the song \"Listen\" from Japanese rock band One Ok Rock's eighth studio album, Ambitions, released on January 11, 2017.[98] Lavigne also features in the song \"Wings Clipped\" by Grey with Anthony Green for the duo's debut EP Chameleon, released on September 29, 2017.[99]\nLavigne's sixth studio album Head Above Water was released on February 15, 2019, through BMG.[100][101] The album reached the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number thirteen on the U.S. Billboard 200. It was preceded by three singles: \"Head Above Water\", \"Tell Me It's Over\", and \"Dumb Blonde\".[102][103][104] The fourth single, \"I Fell in Love with the Devil\", was released on June 28, 2019.[105]\nLavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video \"Nobody's Home\" involved the most \"acting\".[106] Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,[107] performing \"Sk8er Boi\"[108] with her band in a nightclub.[109] She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film Going the Distance. The main characters bump into her backstage at the MuchMusic Video Awards[110] after her performance of \"Losing Grip\".[111]\nShe moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico[112] to film a single scene in the 2007 film, The Flock.[113] She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.[113] On her role in The Flock, Lavigne said, \"I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast\".[106] The Flock was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7\u00a0million in the foreign box office.[114]\nLavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, \"All the actors went in individually, and [director] Tim and [screenwriter Karey] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.\"[115] Lavigne found the recording process to be \"easy\" and \"natural\", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. \"I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.\" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. \"[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude\".[106] The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38\u00a0million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336\u00a0million worldwide.[116]\nIn December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in Fast Food Nation, based on the book Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal.[117] The fictionalized adaptation, directed by Richard Linklater, traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.[118] Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.[119][120] The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2\u00a0million worldwide.[121]\nBoth Over the Hedge and Fast Food Nation opened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the \"right parts and the right movies.\" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. \"I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.\"[106] In August 2006, Canadian Business magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.[122]\nIn July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line Abbey Dawn, featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by Kohl's, which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.[123][124] Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a \"juniors lifestyle brand\",[64] which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and \"hot pinks and blacks\". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. \"I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.\"[125] The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, \"after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career\".[75]\nThe designs were also featured on the Internet game Stardoll, where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.[126] On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the New York Fashion Week,[127] returning in 2011.[75] In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.[128][129] \"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find.\"[72]\nLavigne released her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter &amp; Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.[130] When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, \"I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are.\"[131] Black Star won the 2010 Best \"Women's Scent Mass\" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).[132] Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, Forbidden Rose, which took two years to develop.[133] It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.[134] Its message is an extension of Black Star's \"follow your dreams\",[135] though the tagline for the new perfume is \"Dare to Discover\".[136] The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting,[135] where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.[136] Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010.[129] The tagline for the fragrance is \"Dare to discover more\".[137] It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.[138]\nIn January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate Alice in Wonderland-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing.[71] Her designs were exhibited at the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising in California beginning in May through September, alongside Colleen Atwood's costumes from the 2010 film.[139]\nLavigne possesses a light-lyric soprano vocal range.[140] Themes in her music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view.[141] Lavigne believes her \"songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true.\"[106] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as \"Losing Grip\", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as \"Complicated\", saying that \"the songs I did with the Matrix\u00a0... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore.\"[142] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that \"I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about\u00a0... Like boys, like dating or relationships\".[143] Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nu metal,[144][145][146][147] which anticipated the emotional intensity and theatrical aesthetics of emo-pop music before it came into the mainstream.[148] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. \"Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through.\"[149] Her objective in writing the album was simply to \"make it fun\".[150] The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs.[151] Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records,[77] with Lavigne describing the album as \"more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional\".[129] Ian McKellen defined her as \"a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian\" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.[152][153]\nDuring the 2000's decade most critics and publications, have identified Lavigne's first three albums as a mix of pop punk, alternative rock and pop rock[154][155][156][157][158][159][160] influenced by a post-grunge sound.[161][162][163][155][164][165] Later on the 2010s, her sound went softer and poppier characterized more for acoustic pop-rock songs and less loud grungy guitar-driven songs that were signature of her earlier works.[166]\nWhile Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said \"I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me\", adding that she had been writing \"full-structured songs\" since she was 14.[50] Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles \"Complicated\", \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm with You\". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that \"[N]one of those songs aren't from me\".[142]\nIn 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism[167] and criticized her songwriting, saying that \"Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything.\"[168] Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for \"clear defamation\" against her character.[169] Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that \"Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her.\"[167] Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" for her song \"Girlfriend\".[170] Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, \"me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a Sum 41 song. It's the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos.\"[169] In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.[171]\nLavigne's earlier influences came from country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain;[142][24] and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia and Janis Joplin.[143] By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk and punk rock acts such as blink-182, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind and Matchbox Twenty.[172][173][174][175][176][177][178]\nBecause of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, \"It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest\".[179] Lavigne commented on the matter: \"I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel\u00a0... punk, and I am so not any of them.\"[50] However, she has also said that her music has punk influences: \"I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do.\"[172][180]\nIn 2003, Lavigne won an International Achievement Award for the song \"Complicated\" at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.[181] Lavigne received eight Grammy Awards nominations in two years, including Best New Artist. She has also received three American Music Awards nominations, one Brit Award nomination, and one MTV Video Music Award. She has received a total of 221 awards and 301 nominations.\nBy 2013, Lavigne had sold more than 50 million singles and 40\u00a0million copies of her albums worldwide,[182] becoming one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the US, with over 12.4\u00a0million copies certified by the RIAA.[183] In 2009, Billboard named Lavigne the number 10 pop artist in the \"Best of the 2000s\" chart.[184] She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in the US.[185][181]\nLavigne holds a Guinness World Record as being the youngest female solo artist to top the UK album chart, on January 11, 2003, at the age of 18 years and 106 days. The album Let Go reached number one in its 18th chart week.[186] She also was the first to reach 100 million views on a YouTube video, with her 2007 single \"Girlfriend\".[187] Lavigne was the first western artist to do a full tour in China, with The Best Damn Tour in 2008; and is considered the biggest western artist in Asia, especially in Japan where her first three albums have sold more than 1 million copies, being the only Female Western Artist since the 2000s to achieve it.[188] Lavigne is the only artist to have performed on three different multi-sport events, such as two closing ceremonies of Winter Olympic Games (Torino 2006[189] and Vancouver 2010[190]) and in the opening ceremony of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.[191]\nLavigne is considered a highlight in the pop-punk and alternative pop-rock scene since she helped to paved the way for the success of female-driven punk-influenced pop music, such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Courage My Love and Hey Monday.[192][193][194][195][196][197] She has been compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair and Courtney Love and earned a reputation as the greatest female representative of pop-punk music, and has been called one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music.[198][5][199][200] Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style.[201][202] \"Sk8er Boi\", \"He Wasn't\" and \"Girlfriend\" are frequently listed among the best pop-punk songs of all time by critics.[203][204][205][206][207]\nThe singer's influences extend beyond rock and pop to include acts such as Aly &amp; AJ,[208] Busted,[209] Billie Eilish,[210] Hilary Duff,[211] Rob Halford (Judas Priest),[212] Courage My Love,[213] Grey,[214] Ed Sheeran,[215] Miley Cyrus,[216] Vanessa Hudgens, Jessie J,[217] Jonas Brothers,[218] Brie Larson,[219] Lesley Roy,[220] Selena Gomez,[221] Ashley Tisdale,[222] Ariana Grande,[223] Paramore,[224] Amy Studt,[225] Meghan Trainor,[226] Hey Monday, Kelly Osbourne, Amanda Palmer, Misono,[227] YUI,[228] Demi Lovato, Kirstin Maldonado,[229] and PVRIS.[224] Lavigne also has fueled a ferocity influence on indie rock singer-songwriters, such as, Soccer Mommy,[230] Snail Mail and Liz Phair.[231]\nOn the rise of mid-to-late 2010s emo hip hop and emo rap, Lavigne have been noted as an influence of various musicians from that scene, like: Lil Uzi Vert, Princess Nokia, Lloyd Banks, Vic Mensa, Nipsey Hussle, John River, Noname and Rico Nasty. American rapper Fat Tony, explained that Lavigne's traces of influences on hip hop and rap music comes because \"she [Avril] delivered a great visual catchy package [punk music, pop music and skater culture] that describes all of them\". Rico Nasty named one of her alter egos, Trap Lavigne, citing \"She is a perfect representation of being hard and soft [...] she hated the term punk, but she was so punk rock\".[232] Nicki Minaj declared herself a huge fan of Lavigne's music.[233]\nLavigne was featured in the 2003 game The Sims: Superstar as a non-playable celebrity.[234]\nIn mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume graphic novel, Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes. She collaborated with artist Camilla d'Errico and writer Joshua Dysart on the manga, which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero, Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, \"I know that many of my fans read manga, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy.\" The first volume was released in April 2007, and the second followed in July 2007. The publication Young Adult Library Services nominated the series for \"Great Graphic Novels for Teens\".[235]\nIn September 2011, Lavigne appeared on the Hub Network televised singing competition Majors &amp; Minors as a guest mentor alongside other singers, including Adam Lambert and Leona Lewis.[75]\nLavigne has been involved with many charities, including Make Some Noise, Amnesty International, Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Special Olympics, Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields, US Campaign for Burma, Make-A-Wish Foundation and War Child. She has also appeared in ALDO ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of UNICEF on November 28, 2007, at the Bell Centre in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.[236] In November 2010, Lavigne attended the Clinton Global Initiative.[237]\nLavigne worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour.[238] She covered \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" for War Child's Peace Songs compilation, and she recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" as her contribution to the compilation album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. Released on June 12, 2007, the album was produced to benefit Amnesty International's campaign to alleviate the crisis in Darfur.[239]\nOn December 5, 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in Mexico City during the biggest charity event in Latin America, \"Teleton\". She performed acoustic versions of her hits \"Complicated\" and \"Girlfriend\" with Evan Taubenfeld and band member, Jim McGorman.[240] In 2010, Lavigne was one of several artists who contributed their voices to a cover of K'naan's \"Wavin' Flag\" as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[241]\nOn September 14, 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, \"The Avril Lavigne Foundation\", which aims to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities[237][242] and works with leading charitable organizations.[128] The foundation partners with the Easter Seals, Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS,[243] Lavigne has worked with the latter two. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, \"I just really wanted to do more\".[242] Lavigne said on the foundation's website, \"I have always looked for ways to give back because I think it's a responsibility we all share\".[244] Philanthropist Trevor Neilson's 12-person firm, Global Philanthropy Group, advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician John Legend.[237]\nIn September 2014, she launched a personal fundraising campaign for Special Olympics as part of her birthday celebration. Proceeds from her \"Team Rockstar\" event helped sponsor athletes from around the world competing in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Los Angeles.[245][246] According to an ABILITY Magazine interview with Lavigne, the athletes were the stars of the music video for \"Fly\", which was shot in Canada.[247]\nWhen Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her tomboyish style,[248] in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations.[249][250] She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses,[72] wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers.[23] During photo shoots, instead of wearing \"glittery get-ups\", she preferred wearing \"old, crumpled T's\".[21] In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the \"pop punk princess\"[251][252] and the female answer to Blink-182.[253] Press and fans regarded her as the \u201canti-Britney\u201d, in part because of her less commercial and \"real\" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. \"I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not.\"[23] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was \"wearing a costume\".[22] Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career.[254]\nLavigne eventually took on a more gothic style as she began her second album, Under My Skin, trading her skating outfits for black tutus[252] and developing an image marked by angst.[255] During The Best Damn Thing years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits,[256] including \"tight jeans and heels\",[72] and modelled for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar.[248] Lavigne defended her new style: \"I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all\u00a0... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on\".[256]\nLavigne has been the subject of a conspiracy theory that states that she committed suicide in 2003, and was replaced by a body double who had previously been recruited to distract paparazzi. This originated as a joke on a Brazilian blog, but has since been embraced by some theorists.[257] In an interview with Australia's KIIS 106.5 in November 2018, Lavigne responded to the rumour, calling it \"weird\".[258]\nOnly a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends.[72] Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate Ben Moody's identical tattoo.[259] In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter \"D\" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley.[72][260] Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday.[72] In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.[261]\nHer love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos of the word \"fuck\" on their ribs.[262][263] Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an \"Abbey Dawn\" on her left forearm and an \"XXV\" and star on her right. Although she confirmed the \"fuck\" tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her \"favorite word\"[72]) she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot.[264] She added that she eventually wanted to get a \"big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name\u00a0... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life.\"[72] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, \"Brody\", tattooed beneath her right breast.[265] The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.[266]\nLavigne has been legally French from birth, because her father is French and France applies jus sanguinis.[267] She applied for her French passport and received it in February 2011.[268] In January 2012, Lavigne's house in Bel-Air, on the market since May 2011,[269] sold, and Lavigne moved to Paris to study the French language. She rented an apartment and attended a Berlitz school.[270][271]\nLavigne and Sum 41 lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley began dating when Lavigne was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17.[272] In June 2005, Whibley proposed to her.[273] The couple married on July 15, 2006, in Montecito, California. On October 9, 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, \"I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship.\"[272] The divorce was finalized on November 16, 2010.[274]\nLavigne started dating The Hills star Brody Jenner in February 2010.[275] After almost two years of dating, the couple split in January 2012.[275]\nLavigne began dating fellow Canadian musician Chad Kroeger, frontman of the band Nickelback, in July 2012.[276][277][278][279] The relationship blossomed after they began working together in March 2012 to write and record music for Lavigne's fifth album.[277][280][279] Lavigne and Kroeger became engaged in August 2012, after one month of dating.[280][276] The couple married at the Ch\u00e2teau de La Napoule, a reconstructed medieval castle on the Mediterranean in the South of France, on July 1, 2013 (which is Canada Day), after a year of being together.[279][281] On September 2, 2015, Lavigne announced her separation from Kroeger via her official Instagram account.[282]\nIn April 2015, Lavigne revealed to People magazine that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease after her 30th birthday in 2014.[283] In an interview with Billboard that same month, Lavigne said that she was in the recovery process and that she wanted to increase awareness of the disease.[97]\nLavigne is a vegetarian.[284]\nCurrent members\n\nFormer members\n\nHeadlining tours\n\nPromotional tours\n\n\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nBritney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Born in McComb, Mississippi and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"Princess of Pop\", Spears is regarded as a pop icon and is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Spears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in Crossroads (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.[1] Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations led Spears to be placed on a still ongoing conservatorship. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), respectively. In 2012, Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58\u00a0million, having last topped the list in 2002.[2] During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her conservator, leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team. Spears has scored six number one albums on the Billboard 200, making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.[3] Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Womanizer\", \"3\", \"Hold It Against Me\", and \"S&M\". Other singles, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" and \"Toxic\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award;[4] the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[5] Billboard ranked her as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s decade.[6] One of the world's best-selling music artists, Spears has sold 150 million records worldwide,[7] including over 70 million records in the United States.[8][9] In the United States, Spears is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era[10] as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.[11][12][13] In 2004, Spears launched a perfume brand with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.; sales exceeded US$1.5\u00a0billion as of 2012[update].[14] Spears has topped the list of most searched celebrities seven times in 12 years, a record since the inception of the internet.[15] Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981 in McComb, Mississippi,[16][17] the second child of Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.[18] Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn Spears.[19] She was born in the Bible Belt, where socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a particularly strong religious influence;[20] Spears was baptized as a Southern Baptist and sang in a church choir as a child.[21] As an adult, she has studied Kabbalist teachings.[22] At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing \"What Child Is This?\" at her kindergarten graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[23][24][25] She said about her ambition as a child, \"I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age\".[24] At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to audition for the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[26][27] In December 1992, she was cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's Parklane Academy. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.\"[24][28] In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\"[29] Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[29] Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that \"it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation\u2014the 'eye of the tiger'\u2014is extremely important. And Britney had that.\"[24] Spears sang Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.[30] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\"[31] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger; more adult contemporary.\" She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it\u2014it's more me.\"[24] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.[24] After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC.[32] Her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[33] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[34] It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.[25] The title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.[31] The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[35][36] \"...Baby One More Time\" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[37] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[38] It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.[39] Spears is the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the UK.[40] \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the ...Baby One More Time album. The album has sold 25 million copies worldwide,[41][42] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is the best-selling debut album by any artist.[43][44][45] On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics.[46] It also generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[47] An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.[28] Oops!... I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the Nielsen SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.[48] The album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date,[49] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that \"the great thing about Oops!\u00a0\u2013 under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock & roll tradition.\"[50] The album's lead single, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations.[40][51] The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[52] The same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears' Heart to Heart, co-written with her mother.[25][53] On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.[54] Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake.[25] Spears and Timberlake would both graduate high school via distance learning from the University of Nebraska High School.[55][56] She also bought a home in Destin, Florida.[57] In February 2001, Spears signed a $7\u20138\u00a0million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled A Mother's Gift.[25] Her self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[58] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 15 million copies worldwide.[40][59][60] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney \"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"[61] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations\u2014Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\"\u2014 and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years\".[62][63] The album's first single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top-ten hit worldwide.[64] Spears's performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger and a large albino python draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[54] Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized Spears's performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting \u2013 surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits \u2013 Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"[65] To support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[66][67] The tour grossed $43.7\u00a0million, becoming the second highest-grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[68] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[69] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears's acting and the film was a box office success.[70][71][72] Crossroads, which had a $12\u00a0million budget, went on to gross over $61.1\u00a0million worldwide.[72] In June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and \"management's failure to keep her fully apprised\".[73] In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.[74] Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song \"Cry Me a River\" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.[75][76] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad \"Everytime\" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[77] The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that \"I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.\"[78] In August 2003, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing \"Like a Virgin\". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.[72] In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of MTV Video Music Awards,[79] while Blender magazine cited it as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[80] Spears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.[25] Vibe called it \"A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter.\"[81] NPR listed the album as one of \"The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade\", adding that \"the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.\"[82] In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies in the United States during its first week of availability in the United States, debuting at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.[25] It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.[83] In the Zone sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[84] The album produced four singles: \"Me Against the Music\", a collaboration with Madonna; \"Toxic\"\u2014which won Spears her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording; \"Everytime\", and \"Outrageous\".[25] In January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears \"lacked understanding of her actions\".[85] In March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.[86] In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for \"Outrageous\". Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[87] During 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[88] In July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[25] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[89] Shortly after, she released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[25] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[90] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[91] Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's \"My Prerogative\" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway.[92] The second single, \"Do Somethin'\", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe.[93][94] In August 2005, Spears released \"Someday (I Will Understand)\", which was dedicated to her first child, a son, who was born the following month.[95] In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes.[96] It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[97] In February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son, Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[25] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode \"Buy, Buy Baby\" as closeted lesbian Amber Louise.[98] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, \"my baby is my religion.\"[88] Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper's Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[25] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, a son.[99] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[100] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.[101] Spears's aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007.[102] In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon in Tarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks.[103] In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M's Tour.[104] In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her children to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public.[105] Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video \"Do Somethin'\" for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.[106] In October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted at the top of charts in Canada and Ireland, number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and the top ten in Australia, Korea, New Zealand and many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the only female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at the two top slots of the chart.[107] The album received positive reviews from critics and has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[108][109] Blackout won Album of the Year at MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 and was listed as the fifth Best Pop Album of the Decade by The Times.[110][111] Spears performed the lead single \"Gimme More\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance was panned by many critics.[112] Despite the backlash, the single rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and the top ten in almost every country it charted.[113][114] The second single \"Piece of Me\" reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third single \"Break the Ice\" was released the following year and had moderate success due to Spears not being able to promote it properly.[115][116][117] In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.[118] In January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that had arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an unidentified substance. The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold. The court placed her under temporary, and later, permanent[119] conservatorship of her father James Spears and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets.[25] She was released five days later.[120] The following month, Spears guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Ten Sessions\" as receptionist Abby. She received positive reviews for her performance, as well as bringing the series its highest ratings ever.[121][122] In July 2008, Spears regained some visitation rights after coming to an agreement with Federline and his counsel.[123] In September 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a pre-taped comedy sketch with Jonah Hill and an introduction speech. She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year for \"Piece of Me\".[124] A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears's return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008.[125] The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6\u00a0million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network's history.[126] In December 2008, Spears's sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics[127] and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations.[114][128] In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[129] She also became the only act in the Soundscan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold.[128] The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year,[130] and has sold 4 million copies worldwide.[131] Its lead single, \"Womanizer\", became Spears's first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since \"...Baby One More Time\". The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden.[132][133] It was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording.[134] In January 2009, Spears and her father James obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney Jon Eardley \u2013 all of whom, court documents claim, had been conspiring to gain control of Spears's affairs. The restraining order forbids Lutfi and Ghalib from contacting Spears or coming within 250 yards of her, her property or family members.[135] Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8\u00a0million, it became the fifth highest-grossing tour of the year.[136] In November 2009, Spears released her second greatest hits album, The Singles Collection.

The episode drew Glee's highest ratings ever.[140][141] In March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale.[142] The album peaked at number one in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. Its peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women.[3] It has sold 1 million copies in the United States, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.[143] The album's lead single, \"Hold It Against Me\" debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears's fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number one, after Mariah Carey.[144] The second single \"Till the World Ends\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May,[145] while the third single \"I Wanna Go\" reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears's first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart. The fourth and final single \"Criminal\" was released in September 2011. The music video caused controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in an area of London that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots.[146] Spears's management briefly responded, stating, \"The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.\"[147] In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna's song \"S&M\".[148] It reached number one in the US later in the month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart.[149] On Billboard's 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year,[150] thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.[151][152] Spears co-wrote \"Whiplash\", a song from American pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene' third album When the Sun Goes Down.[153] In June 2011, Spears embarked on the Femme Fatale Tour.[154] The first ten dates of the tour grossed $6.2\u00a0million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year.[155] The tour ended on December 10, 2011 in Puerto Rico after 79 performances.[156] A DVD of the tour was released in November 2011.[157] In August 2011, Spears received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[158] The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2.[159] In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent.[160] Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012.[161] In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears's co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.[162][163] In May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Paula Abdul. With a reported salary of $15\u00a0million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history.[164] However, Katy Perry broke her record in 2018 after Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on ABC's revival of American Idol.[165][166] She mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season. Spears did not return for the show's third season and her spot was filled by Kelly Rowland.[167] Spears was featured on will.i.am's \"Scream & Shout\", which was released as a single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013). The song later became Spears's sixth number one single on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at No. 3 on US Billboard Hot 100. Scream & Shout was among the best selling songs of 2012 and 2013 with denoting sales of over 8.1\u00a0million worldwide, the accompanying music video was the third-most viewed video in 2013 on VEVO despite the video being released in 2012.[168][failed verification] In December, Forbes magazine named her music's top-earning woman of 2012, with estimated earnings of $58\u00a0million.[169] Spears began work on her eighth studio album, Britney Jean, in December 2012,[170] and enlisted will.i.am as its executive producer in May 2013.[171] During the production of Britney Jean, Spears recorded the song \"Ooh La La\" for the soundtrack of The Smurfs 2, which was released in June 2013.[172] On September 17, 2013, she appeared on Good Morning America to announce her two-year concert residency at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, titled Britney: Piece of Me. It began on December 27, 2013, and included a total of 100 shows throughout 2014 and 2015.[173][174] During the same appearance, Spears announced that Britney Jean would be released on December 3, 2013, in the United States.[175][176] It was released through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records in 2011, which had formed the joint RCA/Jive Label Group (initially known as BMG Label Group) between 2007 and 2011.[177] Britney Jean became Spears's final project under her original recording contract with Jive, which had guaranteed the release of eight studio albums.[178] The record received a low amount of promotion and had little commercial impact, reportedly due to time conflicts involving preparations for Britney: Piece of Me.[179] Upon its release, the record debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 107,000 copies, becoming her lowest-peaking and lowest-selling album in the United States.[180] Britney Jean debuted at number 34 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 12,959 copies in its first week. In doing so, it became Spears's lowest-charting and lowest-selling album in the country.[181] \"Work Bitch\" was released as the lead single from Britney Jean on September 16, 2013, one day earlier than expected after being leaked online.[182] It debuted and peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 marking Spears's 31st song on the chart and the fifth highest debut of her career on the chart, and her seventh in the top 20. It also marked Spears's 19th top 20 hit and overall her 23rd top 40 hit. The song marked Spears's highest sales debut since her 2011 number one hit \"Hold It Against Me\". \"Work Bitch\" also had commercial success in the UK debuting and peaking at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. The song also charted well in several other countries, peaking within the top ten of the charts in Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain and South Korea.[183] The second single \"Perfume\" premiered on November 3, 2013, two days earlier than originally announced.[184][185] It debuted and peaked at number 76 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[186] In October 2013, she was featured as a guest vocalist on Miley Cyrus's track \"SMS (Bangerz)\", taken from her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013).[187] On January 8, 2014, Spears won Favorite Pop Artist at the 40th People's Choice Awards at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.[188] In August 2014, Spears confirmed she had renewed her contract with RCA and that she was writing and recording new music for her next album.[189] Spears announced through her Twitter account in August 2014 that she would be releasing an intimate apparel line called \"The Intimate Britney Spears\". It was available to be purchased beginning on September 9, 2014 in the United States and Canada through Spears's Intimate Collection website. It was later available on September 25 for purchase in Europe. The company now ships to over 200 countries including Australia and New Zealand.[190] On September 25, 2014, Spears confirmed on Good Morning Britain that she had extended her contract with The AXIS and Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, to continue Britney: Piece of Me for two additional years.[191] In March 2015, it was confirmed by People magazine that Spears would release a new single, \"Pretty Girls\", with Iggy Azalea, on May 4, 2015.[192] The song debuted and peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charted moderately in international territories. Spears and Azalea performed the track live at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards from The AXIS, the home of Spears's residency, to positive critical response. Entertainment Weekly praised the performance, noting \"Spears gave one of her most energetic televised performances in years.\"[193] On June 16, 2015, Giorgio Moroder released his album, Deja Vu, that featured Spears on \"Tom's Diner\".[194] The song was released as the fourth single from the album on October 9.[195] In an interview, Moroder praised Spears's vocals and said that she did a \"good job\" with the song and also stated that Spears \"sounds so good that you would hardly recognize her.\"[196][197] At the 2015 Teen Choice Awards, Spears received the Candie's Style Icon Award, her ninth Teen Choice Award.[198] In November, Spears guest starred as a fictionalized version of herself on The CW series, Jane the Virgin.[199] On the show, she danced to \"Toxic\" with Gina Rodriguez's character.[200] In 2016, Spears confirmed via social media that she had begun recording her ninth studio album.[201] On March 1, 2016, V magazine announced that Spears would appear on the cover of its 100th issue, dated March 8, 2016, in addition to revealing three different covers shot by photographer Mario Testino for the milestone publication.[202] Editor-in-chief of the magazine, Stephen Gan, revealed that Spears was selected for the \"V100\" issue because of her status as an icon in the industry. On the decision, Gan stated, \"who in our world did not grow up listening to her music?\"[203] In May 2016, Spears launched a casual role-play gaming application titled Britney Spears: American Dream.

On August 16, 2016, MTV and Spears announced that she would perform at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.[209] The performance marked Spears's first time returning to the VMA stage after her widely controversial performance of \"Gimme More\" at the 2007 show nine years earlier.[210] Along with \"Make Me...\", Spears and G-Eazy also performed the latter's hit song \"Me, Myself & I\".[211] Spears appeared on the cover of Marie Claire UK for the October 2016 issue. In the publication, Spears revealed that she had suffered from crippling anxiety in the past, and that motherhood played a major role in helping her overcome it.[212] \"My boys don't care if everything isn't perfect. They don't judge me,\" Spears said in the issue.[213] In November 2016, during an interview with Las Vegas Blog, Spears confirmed she had already begun work on her next album, stating: \"I'm not sure what I want the next album to sound like.

On April 29, 2017, Spears became the first recipient of the Icon Award at the 2017 Radio Disney Music Awards.[220] On November 4, 2017, Spears attended the grand opening of the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas.[221] Later that month, Forbes announced that Spears was the 8th highest earning female musician, earning $34\u00a0million in 2017.[222] On December 31, 2017, Spears performed the final show of Britney: Piece of Me.[223] The final performance reportedly brought in $1.172\u00a0million, setting a new box office record for a single show in Las Vegas, and breaking the record previously held by Jennifer Lopez.[223] The last show was broadcast live with performances of \"Toxic\" and \"Work Bitch\" airing on ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to a record audience of 25.6\u00a0million.[224] In January 2018, Spears released her 24th perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Sunset Fantasy,[225] and announced the Piece of Me Tour which took place in July 2018 in North American and Europe.[226] Tickets were sold out within minutes for major cities, and additional dates were added to meet the demand.[227] Pitbull was the supporting act for the European leg.[228] The tour ranked at 86 and 30 on Pollstar's 2018 Year-End Top 100 Tours chart both in North America and worldwide, respectively. In total, the tour grossed $54.3 million with 260,531 tickets sold and was the sixth highest-grossing female tour of 2018, and was the United Kingdom's second best-selling female tour of 2018.[229][230] On March 20, 2018, Spears was announced as part of a campaign for French luxury fashion house Kenzo.[231] The company said it aimed to shake up the 'jungle' world of fashion with Spears's 'La Collection Memento No. 2' campaign.[232] On April 12, 2018, Spears was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[233] On April 27, 2018, Epic Rights announced a new partnership with Spears to debut her own fashion line in 2019, which would include clothing, fitness apparel, accessories, and electronics.[234] In July 2018, Spears released her first unisex fragrance, Prerogative.[235] On October 21, 2018, Spears performed at the Formula One Grand Prix in Austin, which ultimately served as the final performance of her Piece of Me Tour.[236] On October 18, 2018, Spears announced her second Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Domination, which was set to launch at Park MGM's Park Theatre on February 13, 2019.[237] Spears was slated to make $507,000 per show, which would have made her the highest paid act on the Las Vegas Strip.[238][239] However, on January 4, 2019, she announced that the residency was cancelled after her father had a near-fatal colon rupture. Her team also announced that Spears would go on an indefinite work hiatus, putting all activities and commitments on hold, so that she can spend time with her family.[240] In March 2019, Spears's co-conservator Andrew Wallet resigned, and said \"Substantial detriment, irreparable harm and immediate danger will result to the conservatee and her estate if the relief requested herein in not granted on an ex parte basis.\"[241] The same month, Spears reportedly entered a psychiatric facility to focus on self-care amidst stress from her father's illness.[242] The podcast Britney's Gram alleged, according to information from an anonymous paralegal source, that Spears had been held against her will in the facility since January 2019. They claimed the hospitalization and Domination cancellation were ordered by Spears's father after she decided to not take her medication and violated rules in her conservatorship, specifically driving. Britney's Gram and several news outlets questioned the length of the conservatorship, as it was supposed to end after The Circus Tour in 2009.[243] Following the podcast, there was social media backlash to the alleged abuse of power and violation of human rights Spears has endured under a conservatorship by her father and the mismanagement of Lou Taylor, who was responsible for initiating the conservatorship.[244] TMZ later posted several conflicting stories, detailing in a video that although Spears had not been formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she is receiving medication for it, and justified this, which was later deleted.[245] On April 22, 2019, fans held a protest outside the West Hollywood City Hall, drawing attention towards the prolonged conservatorship, suggesting she was being detained against her will.[246][247][248] Spears posted a video Instagram account on April 24, assuring fans all is well and also addressed leaked emails about Lou Taylor, claiming they were written by her ex-manager Sam Lutfi.\"[249][250] Spears left the facility the following day.[251] It was reported on April 24, 2019, that Spears would have a new conservatorship hearing for May 10, 2019.[252] Spears attended the hearing with her mother.[253][254] Following the hearing, an investigation was ordered into Spears's conservatorship.[255] According to alleged reports by TMZ, she stated in court that she was forcibly put into the mental health facility.[256][257] On September 3, 2019, it was reported that Spears' father and conservator allegedly abused her thirteen year old son, Sean Preston. Law enforcement spoke to The Blast to report the incident, stating Kevin Federline filed a police report on August 25.[258] It was later reported that Jamie Spears was reportedly so enraged during an argument with his 13-year-old grandson that he broke down a door to get to the young boy, and the incident has sparked a child abuse investigation. Britney then sent her sons back to their father's home, despite it still being her custodial visit time.[259] Spears' two sons have since been granted a three year restraining order against their grandfather.[260] Spears has cited Madonna, Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston as being major influences in her career, her \"three favorite artists\" as a child, whom she would \"sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room\"; Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.[261] Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Jackson in particular, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence. According to Spears: \"I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was.\"[262] In the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: \"I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.\"[263] After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: \"she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.\"[264] Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: \"I admire her talent as an artist [...] There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career\".[265] She has also named Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Brandy, Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Timberlake, Natalie Imbruglia, Cher, and Prince as sources of inspiration.[266][267][268][269][270] Spears also felt inspired by artists from younger generations, such as Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande.[271][272] Spears is described as a pop singer[17] and generally explores the genre in the form of dance-pop.[273][274][275] Following her debut, she was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s.[276] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene.\"[277] In a review for ...Baby One More Time, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to her music as a \"blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry.\"[278] Oops!...I Did It Again saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers, which led to \"a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga.\"[279] Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche \"[r]hythmically and melodically\", but was described as \"sharper, tougher than what came before\", incorporating genres such as R&B, disco and funk.[61][280] Spears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop[281][282] and dance music in her records, as well as influences of urban and hip hop which are most present in In the Zone and Blackout.[282][283][284] Femme Fatale and Britney Jean were also heavily influenced by electronic music genres.[285][286] The music found on ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again generally explores themes such as love and relationships from a teenager's point of view.[287][288] After the enormous success of her first two studio albums, Spears's team and producers wanted to maintain the formula that took her to the top of the charts.[287] Spears, however, was no longer satisfied with the sound and themes covered on her records. She cowrote five songs and choose each track's producer on Britney, her third studio album, which lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood, sexuality and self-discovery.[61][287][280] Sex, dancing, freedom and love continued to be Spears's music main subjects on her subsequent albums.[283][284][286][285] Her fifth studio album, Blackout, also address issues such as media scrutiny and fame, most notably in \"Piece of Me\".[284][289] Spears is a soprano.[294][295][296][297] Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung \"much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today\", with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears for her debut album ...Baby One More Time, being cited as \"[shaping] her voice over the course of a month\" upon being signed to Jive Records \"to where it is today\u2014distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[29] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, \"I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice.\"[298] Guy Blackman of The Age wrote that \"[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. [...] Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability.\"[299] Producer William Orbit, who collaborated with Spears on her album Britney Jean, stated regarding her vocals: \"[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing\".[300] Spears has also been criticized for her reliance on auto-tune[301] and her vocals being \"over-processed\" on records.[302] Erlewine criticized Spears's poor singing abilities in a review for Blackout, saying, \"Never the greatest vocalist, her thin squawk could be dismissed early in her career as an adolescent learning the ropes, but nearly a decade later her singing hasn't gotten any better, even if the studio tools to masquerade her weaknesses have.\"[284] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe remarked that \"Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.\"[303] The Michigan Daily's Kayla Upadhyaya provided a different point of view, saying, \"Auto-tuned and over-processed vocals define Britney's voice as an artist, and in her music, auto-tune isn't so much a gimmick as it is an instrument used to highlight, contort and make a statement.\"[304] Spears is known for her stage performances, particularly the elaborate dance routines which incorporate \"belly-dancing and tempered erotic moves\" that are credited for influencing \"dance-heavy acts\" such as Danity Kane and the Pussycat Dolls.[305][306] Rolling Stone magazine readers voted Spears as the second Favorite Dancing Musician.[307] Spears is described as being much more shy than what her stage persona suggests.[308][309][310] She claimed that performing is \"a boost to [her] confidence. It's like an alter-ego type thing. Something clicks and I go and turn into this different person. I think it's kind of a gift to be able to do that.\"[311] Her 2000, 2001, and 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performances received praise,[312] while her 2007 presentation was widely panned by critics, as she \"teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words\".[313] Billboard called her 2016 \"comeback\" performance at the show \"An effective, but not entirely glorious, bid to regain pop superstardom\".[296] After her knee injuries and personal struggles, Spears's \"showmanship\" and dance abilities came under criticism.[305][314] Serge F. Kovaleski of The New York Times watched her Las Vegas concert residency in 2016 and said: \"Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets.\"[315] Las Vegas Sun's Robin Leach seemed more impressed over Spears's efforts on the concert by saying that she delivered a \"flawless performance\" on the residency's opening night.[316] It has been widely reported that Spears lip-syncs during live performances,[306][317][318] which often draws criticism from music critics and concert goers.[314][319][320] Some, however, claimed that, although she \"got plenty of digital support\", she \"doesn't merely lip-sync\" during her live shows.[321] In 2016, Sabrina Weiss of Refinery29 referred to her lip-syncing as a \"well-known fact that's not even taboo anymore.\"[322] Noting on the prevalence of lip-syncing, Los Angeles Daily News opined: \"In the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? [...] you [just] go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all\".[323] Spears spoke on the topic saying \"[...] Because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback.\" She added: \"It really pisses me off because I'm busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever gives me credit for it, you know?\"[317] Spears rose to fame as a bubblegum pop singer in the late 1990s and was labelled as a teen idol.[324][325] Rolling Stone magazine described Spears in her early years of fame as \"the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm.\"[326] The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing an open top revealing her bra, and shorts.[326] The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\" and called on \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.\" Spears responded to the outcry commenting, \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.\"[327] Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a virgin until marriage.[25][328] Billboard opined that, by the time she released her second album Oops!... I Did it Again, \"There was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image: She was sharper, sexier and singing about more grown-up fare, setting the stage for 2001\u2019s Britney\".[329] Britney's lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and its video were also credited for distancing her from her \"wholesome bubblegum star\" image of the past.[324][330] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, \"If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.\" Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated \"maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[283] Spears's erratic behavior and personal struggles during 2006\u20142008 were highly publicised[331] and affected both her career and public image.[284][332] Erlewine reflected on that time of her career by saying that \"each new disaster [was] stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image\".[284] Spears later received favorable media attention. Time's Cady Lang observed that she looked healthier during her appearance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards,[312] while Business Insider wrote an article about how Spears \"lost control of her life [...] and then made an incredible career comeback\".[333] In September 2002, she was ranked eight on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list,[334] and, in December 2012, Complex ranked her 12 on its 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time list.[335] Spears commented on her sex symbol image by saying, \"[...] When I'm on stage, that's my time to do my thing and go there and be that \u2014 and it's fun. It's exhilarating just to be something that you're not. And people tend to believe it.\"[287] In 2003, People cited her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[336] Spears is also recognized as a gay icon. She was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[233] Billboard's Patrick Crowley reflected on her winning the award, \"While it's no secret that LGBTQ fans saw their struggle reflected in Spears' particularly rough mid-career slump, followed by her phoenix-like rise back to the top of the charts\u2014it's really her outstanding advocacy for the community that earned her this award.\"[337] Manuel Betancourt of Vice magazine wrote about the \"queer adoration\", especially of gay men, on Spears, and said that \"Where other gay icons exude self-possession, Spears's fragile resilience has made her an even more fascinating role model, closer to Judy Garland than to Lady Gaga [...] she's a glittering mirror ball, a fractured reflection of those men on the dance floor back onto themselves.\"[308] Since her early years of stardom, Spears become a tabloid fixture and a paparazzi target, which affected her personal life as well.[329][338][328] Steve Huey of AllMusic claimed that \"among female singers of [Spears's] era [...] her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez.\"[328] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[339] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[340] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000\u20132009.[341] E!'s Melanie Bromley described her 2007 highly publicised breakdown as \"one of the biggest public meltdowns in pop culture history.\"[338] She reflected on that time of her life in a 2017 interview, saying \"I think I had to give myself more breaks through my career and take responsibility for my mental health. [...] I wrote back then, that I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. I was trying to please everyone around me because that\u2019s who I am deep inside. There are moments where I look back and think: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"[342] As a public figure, Spears \"has never been very publicly political\".[343] In October 2001, she registered as a Republican in Louisiana, according to public records.[343] In a September 2003 interview on CNN, she spoke about the then-U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, by saying that \"we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes [...] and be faithful in what happens\".[343][344] In 2016, she posted photos of a meeting with Hillary Clinton on her social media.[343] Spears was described by Rolling Stone magazine as \"One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 2000s\", which also pointed out that she, alongside other acts, \"spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop.\"[276] Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote in 2000: \"Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena\u00a0\u2014 a child with a full-time career. [...] Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry.\"[345] Billboard's Robert Kelly observed that Spears's \"sexy and coy\" vocals on her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\" \"kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come.\"[346] Spears has been recognised with a number of honorific nicknames, most notably the \"Princess of Pop.\"[347][348] Billboard claimed that she \"has earned her title as one of pop's reigning queens. Since her early days as a Mouseketeer, [Spears] has pushed the boundaries of 21st century sounds, paving the way for a generation of artists to shamelessly embrace glossy pop and redefine how one can accrue consistent success in the music industry.\"[329] In 2012, she was ranked as the fourth VH1's 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era show list.[349] VH1 also cited her among its choices on the 100 Greatest Women in Music in 2012[350] and the 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons in 2003.[351] NME critics ranked her single \"Toxic\" at number 92 on the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, writing that the song \"reinvented popular dance music.\"[352] In 2011, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly commented on Spears's voice and music: \"We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer [...] we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. [...] She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. [...] Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls.\"[353] In 2018, Rolling Stone included Spears on its Millennial 100 list and said that, following the release of her music career in the late 1990s, she \"quickly became the princess of pop, helping to usher in a new era for the genre that had gone dormant in the decade that followed New Kids on the Block. [...] Spears would lead an army of pop stars... built on slick Max Martin productions, plenty of sexual innuendo and dance-heavy performances. [She became] one of the most successful artists of all time \u2014 and a cautionary tale for a generation, whether they paid attention or not.\"[354] Spears's work has influenced artists including Taylor Swift,[355] Katy Perry,[356] Meghan Trainor,[357] Demi Lovato,[356] Kelly Key,[358] Kristinia DeBarge,[359] Little Boots,[360] Charli XCX,[361] Marina Diamandis,[362] Tegan and Sara,[363] Pixie Lott,[364] Grimes,[365] Selena Gomez,[366] Hailee Steinfeld,[367] Tinashe,[368] Victoria Justice,[369] Cassie,[370] Leah Wellbaum of Slothrust,[371] The Saturdays,[372] Normani,[373] Miley Cyrus,[374] Cheryl,[375] Lana Del Rey,[376] Ava Max,[377] and Billie Eilish.[378] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears \"taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.\"[379] Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her \"the most provocative performer of my time.\"[380] Before Spears joined The X Factor, Simon Cowell explained that he is \"fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about \u2013 not just pop stars \u2013 but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. [...] She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.\"[381] Marina Diamandis named Spears as the main influence behind her album Electra Heart.[382] Lana Del Rey has said that the music video for \"Toxic\" inspires her.[383] Spears has had a direct influence on singer Porcelain Black's work after growing up around her music as a child. Black describes her music as a \"love child between\" Marilyn Manson and Spears.[384] Spears's much-publicized personal struggles and her career comeback after this period has inspired some artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character in 2010 drama film Country Strong was inspired by the singer's treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, \"that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.\"[385] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears's comeback after her much-publicized personal issues as an inspiration.[386] Spears's hounding by paparazzi and personal struggles also contributed to inspiring Barry Manilow's album 15 Minutes. Manilow said: \"She couldn't have a life without them pulling up next to her car and following her and driving her crazy to the point where, that was around the time she shaved off her hair. [...] We all looked at it in horror [...] So it seemed like a thing to be writing an album about.\"[387] Bebo Norman wrote a song about Spears, called \"Britney\", which was inspired by \"culture's make-or-break treatment of celebrities.\"[388] Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award; the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; the GLAAD Media Award's Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the \"Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist\" for her debut album ...Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.[389] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: \"She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide\".[390] As of 2017[update], according to Billboard, she has sold 150 million records worldwide,[7] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time; and more than 70 million records in United States, including 36.9 million digital singles and 33.6 million digital albums.[8][9] Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s in the United States, as well as the fifth overall.[11] In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.[6] She is one of the few artists in history to have had a number one single and a number one studio album in the US during each of the three decades of her career.[391] With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.[144] In 2016, Spears ranked at number twenty on Billboard's Greatest Of All Time Top Dance Club Artists list.[392] In 2000, the singer released a limited edition of sunglasses titled Shades of Britney.[393] In 2001, Spears signed a deal with shoe company Skechers,[394] and a $7\u20138\u00a0million promotional deal with Pepsi, their biggest entertainment deal at the time.[395] Aside from numerous commercials with the latter during that year, she also appeared in a 2004 Pepsi television commercial in the theme of \"Gladiators\" with singers Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[396] On June 19, 2002, she released her first multi-platform video game, Britney's Dance Beat, which received positive reviews.[397] In March 2009, Spears was announced as the new face of clothing brand Candie's.[398] Dari Marder, chief marketing officer for the brand, explained why they choose the singer, saying, \"everybody loves a comeback and nobody's doing it better than Britney. She's just poised for even greater success.\"[398] In 2010, Spears designed a limited edition line for the brand, which was released in stores in July 2010.[139] In 2011, she teamed up with Sony, Make Up For Ever and PlentyofFish to release her music video for \"Hold It Against Me\", earning her $500,000 for the product placement.[399] Spears also teamed up with Hasbro in 2012 to release an exclusive version of Twister Dance, which includes a remix of \"Till the World Ends\". The singer was also featured on a commercial, which was directed by Ray Kay, to promote the game. Spears was also featured on the commercial of \"Twister Rave\" and the game included a Twister remix of \"Circus\".[400] In March 2018, it was revealed that Spears would be the face of KENZO, a contemporary French luxury clothing house.[231] Spears's range of commercial deals and products also includes beauty care products and perfumes. She released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious in 2004, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[25] By 2009, she had released seven more perfumes including Fantasy.[401][402] In 2010, Spears released her eighth fragrance, Radiance. In March 2011, company Brand Sense filed a lawsuit against Spears and Elizabeth Arden seeking $10\u00a0million in damages, claiming that the singer and her father, Jamie, stopped paying their thirty-five percent commission that was agreed as part of the contract terms.[403] In July 2011, a Los Angeles judge denied the request by the company lawyers, claiming the fact that Spears is still under conservatorship.[404] Brand Sense, however, stated that they would appeal the decision.[404] In 2011, Radiance was re-issued as a new perfume titled Cosmic Radiance.[405] Worldwide, Spears sold over one million bottles in the first five years, with gross receipts of $1.5\u00a0billion. In 2016, Spears contacted Glu Mobile to create her own role-playing game, Britney Spears: American Dream. The app officially launched in May 2016 and is compatible with IOS and Android.[204] On June 17, 2016, Spears announced the release of her twentieth fragrance, Private Show.[406] As of January\u00a02018[update], Spears has released 24 fragrances through Elizabeth Arden.[407] The singer founded The Britney Spears Foundation, a charitable entity set up to help children in need. The philosophy behind the Foundation was that music and entertainment has a healing quality that can benefit children.[408] The Foundation also supported the annual Britney Spears Camp for the Performing Arts, where campers had the opportunity to explore and develop their talents.[409] In April 2002, through the efforts of Spears and The Britney Spears Foundation, a grant of $1\u00a0million was made to the Twin Towers Fund to support the children of uniformed service heroes affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including New York City Fire Department and its Emergency Medical Services Command, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State Office of court Administration and other government offices.[410] However, it was reported in 2008 that the Foundation had a deficit of $200,000.[411] After the singer went through conservatorship, her father and lawyer Andrew Wallet zeroed out the effort, leading to its closure in 2011.[412] On October 30, 2001, Spears, alongside Bono and other popular recording artists under the name \"Artists Against AIDS Worldwide\", released a single titled \"What's Going On\", with the intention to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and other impoverished regions.[413] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2006, Spears donated $350,000 to Music Rising.[414] Later in 2011, the singer raised $200,000 during An Evening of Southern Style at a private residence in Beverly Hills to benefit the St. Bernard Project, with the help of several celebrities, including Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Kellan Lutz and Kim Kardashian.[415] Spears has also helped several charities during her career, including Madonna's Kabbalah-based Spirituality for Kids,[416] cancer charity Gilda's Club Worldwide,[417] Promises Foundation, and United Way, with the latter two focused on giving families from various disadvantaged situations new hope and stable foundations for the future.[414] On October 24, 2015, Spears donated $120,000 to the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.[418] In addition, $1 of each ticket sale for her Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, was donated to the nonprofit organization.[419] Spears also fundraised for the charity through social media, in addition to selling limited edition merchandise, with all proceeds going to the NCCF.[420] On October 27, 2016, Spears partnered with Zappos and XCYCLE to host the Britney Spears Piece of Me Charity Ride in Boca Park, Las Vegas to raise additional money toward her goal of $1\u00a0million for the NCCF, with $450,000 having already been raised from Spears's ticket sales and merchandise.[421] Participants were entered for a chance to win a spin class with Spears herself. The event ultimately went on to raise $553,130.[422] The fundraising ultimately led to the development of the NCCF Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas, which saw its grand opening on November 4, 2017.[423] Spears also regularly participates in Spirit Day to combat bullying of LGBTQ youth and bullying.[424]",

Referred to as the \"Princess of Pop\", Spears is regarded as a pop icon and is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in Crossroads (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.[1] Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations led Spears to be placed on a still ongoing conservatorship. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), respectively. In 2012, Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58\u00a0million, having last topped the list in 2002.[2] During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her conservator, leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the Billboard 200, making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.[3] Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Womanizer\", \"3\", \"Hold It Against Me\", and \"S&amp;M\". Other singles, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" and \"Toxic\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award;[4] the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[5]\nBillboard ranked her as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s decade.[6] One of the world's best-selling music artists, Spears has sold 150 million records worldwide,[7] including over 70 million records in the United States.[8][9] In the United States, Spears is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era[10] as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.[11][12][13] In 2004, Spears launched a perfume brand with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.; sales exceeded US$1.5\u00a0billion as of 2012[update].[14] Spears has topped the list of most searched celebrities seven times in 12 years, a record since the inception of the internet.[15]\nBritney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981 in McComb, Mississippi,[16][17] the second child of Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.[18] Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn Spears.[19] She was born in the Bible Belt, where socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a particularly strong religious influence;[20] Spears was baptized as a Southern Baptist and sang in a church choir as a child.[21] As an adult, she has studied Kabbalist teachings.[22]\nAt age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing \"What Child Is This?\" at her kindergarten graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[23][24][25] She said about her ambition as a child, \"I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age\".[24]\nAt age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to audition for the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[26][27] In December 1992, she was cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's Parklane Academy. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.\"[24][28]\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\"[29]\nTwo weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[29] Senior vice president of A&amp;R Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that \"it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation\u2014the 'eye of the tiger'\u2014is extremely important. And Britney had that.\"[24] Spears sang Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.[30] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\"[31] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger; more adult contemporary.\" She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it\u2014it's more me.\"[24] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.[24]\nAfter Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC.[32] Her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[33] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[34] It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.[25]\nThe title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.[31] The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[35][36] \"...Baby One More Time\" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[37] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[38] It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.[39] Spears is the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the UK.[40] \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the ...Baby One More Time album. The album has sold 25 million copies worldwide,[41][42] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is the best-selling debut album by any artist.[43][44][45]\nOn June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics.[46] It also generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[47] An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.[28]\nOops!... I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the Nielsen SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.[48] The album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date,[49] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that \"the great thing about Oops!\u00a0\u2013 under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock &amp; roll tradition.\"[50] The album's lead single, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations.[40][51] The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[52]\nThe same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears' Heart to Heart, co-written with her mother.[25][53] On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.[54] Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake.[25] Spears and Timberlake would both graduate high school via distance learning from the University of Nebraska High School.[55][56] She also bought a home in Destin, Florida.[57]\nIn February 2001, Spears signed a $7\u20138\u00a0million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled A Mother's Gift.[25] Her self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[58] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 15 million copies worldwide.[40][59][60] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney \"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"[61] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations\u2014Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\"\u2014 and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years\".[62][63] The album's first single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top-ten hit worldwide.[64] Spears's performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger and a large albino python draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[54] Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized Spears's performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting \u2013 surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits \u2013 Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"[65]\nTo support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[66][67] The tour grossed $43.7\u00a0million, becoming the second highest-grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[68] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[69] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears's acting and the film was a box office success.[70][71][72] Crossroads, which had a $12\u00a0million budget, went on to gross over $61.1\u00a0million worldwide.[72]\nIn June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and \"management's failure to keep her fully apprised\".[73] In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.[74] Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song \"Cry Me a River\" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.[75][76] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad \"Everytime\" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[77] The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that \"I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.\"[78]\nIn August 2003, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing \"Like a Virgin\". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.[72] In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of MTV Video Music Awards,[79] while Blender magazine cited it as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[80] Spears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.[25] Vibe called it \"A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter.\"[81] NPR listed the album as one of \"The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade\", adding that \"the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.\"[82] In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies in the United States during its first week of availability in the United States, debuting at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.[25] It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.[83] In the Zone sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[84] The album produced four singles: \"Me Against the Music\", a collaboration with Madonna; \"Toxic\"\u2014which won Spears her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording; \"Everytime\", and \"Outrageous\".[25]\nIn January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears \"lacked understanding of her actions\".[85]\nIn March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.[86] In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for \"Outrageous\". Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[87]\nDuring 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[88]\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[25] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[89] Shortly after, she released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[25] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[90] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[91] Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's \"My Prerogative\" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway.[92] The second single, \"Do Somethin'\", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe.[93][94] In August 2005, Spears released \"Someday (I Will Understand)\", which was dedicated to her first child, a son, who was born the following month.[95] In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes.[96] It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[97]\nIn February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son, Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[25] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will &amp; Grace episode \"Buy, Buy Baby\" as closeted lesbian Amber Louise.[98] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, \"my baby is my religion.\"[88] Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper's Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[25] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, a son.[99] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[100] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.[101]\nSpears's aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007.[102] In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon in Tarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks.[103] In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M's Tour.[104] In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her children to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public.[105] Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video \"Do Somethin'\" for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.[106]\nIn October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted at the top of charts in Canada and Ireland, number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and the top ten in Australia, Korea, New Zealand and many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the only female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at the two top slots of the chart.[107] The album received positive reviews from critics and has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[108][109] Blackout won Album of the Year at MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 and was listed as the fifth Best Pop Album of the Decade by The Times.[110][111] Spears performed the lead single \"Gimme More\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance was panned by many critics.[112] Despite the backlash, the single rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and the top ten in almost every country it charted.[113][114] The second single \"Piece of Me\" reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third single \"Break the Ice\" was released the following year and had moderate success due to Spears not being able to promote it properly.[115][116][117] In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.[118]\nIn January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that had arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an unidentified substance. The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold. The court placed her under temporary, and later, permanent[119] conservatorship of her father James Spears and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets.[25] She was released five days later.[120]\nThe following month, Spears guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Ten Sessions\" as receptionist Abby. She received positive reviews for her performance, as well as bringing the series its highest ratings ever.[121][122] In July 2008, Spears regained some visitation rights after coming to an agreement with Federline and his counsel.[123] In September 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a pre-taped comedy sketch with Jonah Hill and an introduction speech. She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year for \"Piece of Me\".[124] A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears's return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008.[125] The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6\u00a0million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network's history.[126]\nIn December 2008, Spears's sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics[127] and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations.[114][128] In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[129] She also became the only act in the Soundscan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold.[128] The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year,[130] and has sold 4 million copies worldwide.[131] Its lead single, \"Womanizer\", became Spears's first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since \"...Baby One More Time\". The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden.[132][133] It was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording.[134] In January 2009, Spears and her father James obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney Jon Eardley \u2013 all of whom, court documents claim, had been conspiring to gain control of Spears's affairs. The restraining order forbids Lutfi and Ghalib from contacting Spears or coming within 250 yards of her, her property or family members.[135] Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8\u00a0million, it became the fifth highest-grossing tour of the year.[136]\nIn November 2009, Spears released her second greatest hits album, The Singles Collection. The album's lead and only single, \"3\" became her third number one single in the U.S.[137] In May 2010, Spears's representatives confirmed she was dating her agent Jason Trawick, and that they had decided to end their professional relationship to focus on their personal relationship.[138] Spears designed a limited edition clothing line for Candie's, which was released in stores in July 2010.[139] In September 2010, she made a cameo appearance on a Spears-themed tribute episode of American TV show Glee, titled \"Britney/Brittany\". The episode drew Glee's highest ratings ever.[140][141]\nIn March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale.[142] The album peaked at number one in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. Its peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women.[3] It has sold 1 million copies in the United States, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.[143]\nThe album's lead single, \"Hold It Against Me\" debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears's fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number one, after Mariah Carey.[144] The second single \"Till the World Ends\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May,[145] while the third single \"I Wanna Go\" reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears's first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart. The fourth and final single \"Criminal\" was released in September 2011. The music video caused controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in an area of London that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots.[146] Spears's management briefly responded, stating, \"The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.\"[147] In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna's song \"S&amp;M\".[148] It reached number one in the US later in the month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart.[149] On Billboard's 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year,[150] thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.[151][152] Spears co-wrote \"Whiplash\", a song from American pop rock band Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene' third album When the Sun Goes Down.[153]\nIn June 2011, Spears embarked on the Femme Fatale Tour.[154] The first ten dates of the tour grossed $6.2\u00a0million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year.[155] The tour ended on December 10, 2011 in Puerto Rico after 79 performances.[156] A DVD of the tour was released in November 2011.[157] In August 2011, Spears received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[158] The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2.[159] In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent.[160] Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012.[161] In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears's co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.[162][163]\nIn May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Paula Abdul. With a reported salary of $15\u00a0million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history.[164] However, Katy Perry broke her record in 2018 after Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on ABC's revival of American Idol.[165][166] She mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season. Spears did not return for the show's third season and her spot was filled by Kelly Rowland.[167] Spears was featured on will.i.am's \"Scream &amp; Shout\", which was released as a single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013). The song later became Spears's sixth number one single on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at No. 3 on US Billboard Hot 100. Scream &amp; Shout was among the best selling songs of 2012 and 2013 with denoting sales of over 8.1\u00a0million worldwide, the accompanying music video was the third-most viewed video in 2013 on VEVO despite the video being released in 2012.[168][failed verification] In December, Forbes magazine named her music's top-earning woman of 2012, with estimated earnings of $58\u00a0million.[169]\nSpears began work on her eighth studio album, Britney Jean, in December 2012,[170] and enlisted will.i.am as its executive producer in May 2013.[171] During the production of Britney Jean, Spears recorded the song \"Ooh La La\" for the soundtrack of The Smurfs 2, which was released in June 2013.[172] On September 17, 2013, she appeared on Good Morning America to announce her two-year concert residency at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, titled Britney: Piece of Me. It began on December 27, 2013, and included a total of 100 shows throughout 2014 and 2015.[173][174] During the same appearance, Spears announced that Britney Jean would be released on December 3, 2013, in the United States.[175][176] It was released through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records in 2011, which had formed the joint RCA/Jive Label Group (initially known as BMG Label Group) between 2007 and 2011.[177] Britney Jean became Spears's final project under her original recording contract with Jive, which had guaranteed the release of eight studio albums.[178] The record received a low amount of promotion and had little commercial impact, reportedly due to time conflicts involving preparations for Britney: Piece of Me.[179] Upon its release, the record debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 107,000 copies, becoming her lowest-peaking and lowest-selling album in the United States.[180] Britney Jean debuted at number 34 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 12,959 copies in its first week. In doing so, it became Spears's lowest-charting and lowest-selling album in the country.[181]\n\"Work Bitch\" was released as the lead single from Britney Jean on September 16, 2013, one day earlier than expected after being leaked online.[182] It debuted and peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 marking Spears's 31st song on the chart and the fifth highest debut of her career on the chart, and her seventh in the top 20. It also marked Spears's 19th top 20 hit and overall her 23rd top 40 hit. The song marked Spears's highest sales debut since her 2011 number one hit \"Hold It Against Me\". \"Work Bitch\" also had commercial success in the UK debuting and peaking at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. The song also charted well in several other countries, peaking within the top ten of the charts in Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain and South Korea.[183]\nThe second single \"Perfume\" premiered on November 3, 2013, two days earlier than originally announced.[184][185] It debuted and peaked at number 76 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[186] In October 2013, she was featured as a guest vocalist on Miley Cyrus's track \"SMS (Bangerz)\", taken from her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013).[187] On January 8, 2014, Spears won Favorite Pop Artist at the 40th People's Choice Awards at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.[188] In August 2014, Spears confirmed she had renewed her contract with RCA and that she was writing and recording new music for her next album.[189] Spears announced through her Twitter account in August 2014 that she would be releasing an intimate apparel line called \"The Intimate Britney Spears\".

It was later available on September 25 for purchase in Europe. The company now ships to over 200 countries including Australia and New Zealand.[190] On September 25, 2014, Spears confirmed on Good Morning Britain that she had extended her contract with The AXIS and Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino, to continue Britney: Piece of Me for two additional years.[191]\nIn March 2015, it was confirmed by People magazine that Spears would release a new single, \"Pretty Girls\", with Iggy Azalea, on May 4, 2015.[192] The song debuted and peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charted moderately in international territories. Spears and Azalea performed the track live at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards from The AXIS, the home of Spears's residency, to positive critical response. Entertainment Weekly praised the performance, noting \"Spears gave one of her most energetic televised performances in years.\"[193] On June 16, 2015, Giorgio Moroder released his album, Deja Vu, that featured Spears on \"Tom's Diner\".[194] The song was released as the fourth single from the album on October 9.[195] In an interview, Moroder praised Spears's vocals and said that she did a \"good job\" with the song and also stated that Spears \"sounds so good that you would hardly recognize her.\"[196][197] At the 2015 Teen Choice Awards, Spears received the Candie's Style Icon Award, her ninth Teen Choice Award.[198] In November, Spears guest starred as a fictionalized version of herself on The CW series, Jane the Virgin.[199] On the show, she danced to \"Toxic\" with Gina Rodriguez's character.[200]\nIn 2016, Spears confirmed via social media that she had begun recording her ninth studio album.[201] On March 1, 2016, V magazine announced that Spears would appear on the cover of its 100th issue, dated March 8, 2016, in addition to revealing three different covers shot by photographer Mario Testino for the milestone publication.[202] Editor-in-chief of the magazine, Stephen Gan, revealed that Spears was selected for the \"V100\" issue because of her status as an icon in the industry. On the decision, Gan stated, \"who in our world did not grow up listening to her music?\"[203] In May 2016, Spears launched a casual role-play gaming application titled Britney Spears: American Dream. The app, created by Glu Mobile, was made available through both iOS and Google Play.[204] On May 22, 2016, Spears performed a medley of her past singles at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards.[205][206] In addition to opening the show, Spears was honored with the Billboard Millennium Award.[207] On July 14, 2016, Spears released the lead single, \"Make Me...\", from her ninth studio album, featuring guest vocals from American rapper G-Eazy.[208] The album, Glory, was formally released on August 26, 2016. On August 16, 2016, MTV and Spears announced that she would perform at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.[209] The performance marked Spears's first time returning to the VMA stage after her widely controversial performance of \"Gimme More\" at the 2007 show nine years earlier.[210] Along with \"Make Me...\", Spears and G-Eazy also performed the latter's hit song \"Me, Myself &amp; I\".[211]\nSpears appeared on the cover of Marie Claire UK for the October 2016 issue. In the publication, Spears revealed that she had suffered from crippling anxiety in the past, and that motherhood played a major role in helping her overcome it.[212] \"My boys don't care if everything isn't perfect. They don't judge me,\" Spears said in the issue.[213] In November 2016, during an interview with Las Vegas Blog, Spears confirmed she had already begun work on her next album, stating: \"I'm not sure what I want the next album to sound like. [...] I just know that I'm excited to get into the studio again and actually have already been back recording.\"[214] In January 2017, Spears received four wins out of four nominations at the 43rd People's Choice Awards, including Favorite Pop Artist, Female Artist, Social Media celebrity as well as Comedic Collaboration for a skit with Ellen DeGeneres for The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[215] In March 2017, Spears announced that her residency concert would be performed abroad as a world tour, Britney: Live in Concert, with dates in select Asian cities.[216][217][218] In April 2017, the Israeli Labor Party announced that it would reschedule its July primary election to avoid conflict with Spears's sold-out Tel Aviv concert, citing traffic and security concerns.[219]\nSpears's manager Larry Rudolph also announced the residency would not be extended following her contract expiration with Caesars Entertainment at the end of 2017. On April 29, 2017, Spears became the first recipient of the Icon Award at the 2017 Radio Disney Music Awards.[220] On November 4, 2017, Spears attended the grand opening of the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas.[221] Later that month, Forbes announced that Spears was the 8th highest earning female musician, earning $34\u00a0million in 2017.[222] On December 31, 2017, Spears performed the final show of Britney: Piece of Me.[223] The final performance reportedly brought in $1.172\u00a0million, setting a new box office record for a single show in Las Vegas, and breaking the record previously held by Jennifer Lopez.[223] The last show was broadcast live with performances of \"Toxic\" and \"Work Bitch\" airing on ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to a record audience of 25.6\u00a0million.[224]\nIn January 2018, Spears released her 24th perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Sunset Fantasy,[225] and announced the Piece of Me Tour which took place in July 2018 in North American and Europe.[226] Tickets were sold out within minutes for major cities, and additional dates were added to meet the demand.[227] Pitbull was the supporting act  for the European leg.[228] The tour ranked at 86 and 30 on Pollstar's 2018 Year-End Top 100 Tours chart both in North America and worldwide, respectively. In total, the tour grossed $54.3 million with 260,531 tickets sold and was the sixth highest-grossing female tour of 2018, and was the United Kingdom's second best-selling female tour of 2018.[229][230] On March 20, 2018, Spears was announced as part of a campaign for French luxury fashion house Kenzo.[231] The company said it aimed to shake up the 'jungle' world of fashion with Spears's 'La Collection Memento No. 2' campaign.[232] On April 12, 2018, Spears was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[233] On April 27, 2018, Epic Rights announced a new partnership with Spears to debut her own fashion line in 2019, which would include clothing, fitness apparel, accessories, and electronics.[234] In July 2018, Spears released her first unisex fragrance, Prerogative.[235] On October 21, 2018, Spears performed at the Formula One Grand Prix in Austin, which ultimately served as the final performance of her Piece of Me Tour.[236]\nOn October 18, 2018, Spears announced her second Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Domination, which was set to launch at Park MGM's Park Theatre on February 13, 2019.[237] Spears was slated to make $507,000 per show, which would have made her the highest paid act on the Las Vegas Strip.[238][239] However, on January 4, 2019, she announced that the residency was cancelled after her father had a near-fatal colon rupture. Her team also announced that Spears would go on an indefinite work hiatus, putting all activities and commitments on hold, so that she can spend time with her family.[240] In March 2019, Spears's co-conservator Andrew Wallet resigned, and said \"Substantial detriment, irreparable harm and immediate danger will result to the conservatee and her estate if the relief requested herein in not granted on an ex parte basis.\"[241] The same month, Spears reportedly entered a psychiatric facility to focus on self-care amidst stress from her father's illness.[242] The podcast Britney's Gram alleged, according to information from an anonymous paralegal source, that Spears had been held against her will in the facility since January 2019. They claimed the hospitalization and Domination cancellation were ordered by Spears's father after she decided to not take her medication and violated rules in her conservatorship, specifically driving. Britney's Gram and several news outlets questioned the length of the conservatorship, as it was supposed to end after The Circus Tour in 2009.[243]\nFollowing the podcast, there was social media backlash to the alleged abuse of power and violation of human rights Spears has endured under a conservatorship by her father and the mismanagement of Lou Taylor, who was responsible for initiating the conservatorship.[244] TMZ later posted several conflicting stories, detailing in a video that although Spears had not been formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she is receiving medication for it, and justified this, which was later deleted.[245] On April 22, 2019, fans held a protest outside the West Hollywood City Hall, drawing attention towards the prolonged conservatorship, suggesting she was being detained against her will.[246][247][248] Spears posted a video Instagram account  on April 24, assuring fans all is well and also addressed leaked emails about Lou Taylor, claiming they were written by her ex-manager Sam Lutfi.\"[249][250] Spears left the facility the following day.[251] It was reported on April 24, 2019, that Spears would have a new conservatorship hearing for May 10, 2019.[252] Spears attended the hearing with her mother.[253][254] Following the hearing, an investigation was ordered into Spears's conservatorship.[255] According to alleged reports by TMZ, she stated in court that she was forcibly put into the mental health facility.[256][257]\nOn September 3, 2019, it was reported that Spears' father and conservator allegedly abused her thirteen year old son, Sean Preston. Law enforcement spoke to The Blast to report the incident, stating Kevin Federline filed a police report on August 25.[258] It was later reported that Jamie Spears was reportedly so enraged during an argument with his 13-year-old grandson that he broke down a door to get to the young boy, and the incident has sparked a child abuse investigation. Britney then sent her sons back to their father's home, despite it still being her custodial visit time.[259] Spears' two sons have since been granted a three year restraining order against their grandfather.[260]\nSpears has cited Madonna, Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston as being major influences in her career, her \"three favorite artists\" as a child, whom she would \"sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room\"; Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.[261] Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Jackson in particular, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence. According to Spears: \"I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was.\"[262] In the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: \"I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.\"[263]\nAfter meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: \"she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.\"[264] Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: \"I admire her talent as an artist [...] There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career\".[265] She has also named Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Brandy, Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Timberlake, Natalie Imbruglia, Cher, and Prince as sources of inspiration.[266][267][268][269][270] Spears also felt inspired by artists from younger generations, such as Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande.[271][272]\nSpears is described as a pop singer[17] and generally explores the genre in the form of dance-pop.[273][274][275] Following her debut, she was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s.[276] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock &amp; roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene.\"[277] In a review for ...Baby One More Time, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to her music as a \"blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry.\"[278] Oops!...I Did It Again saw Spears working with several contemporary R&amp;B producers, which led to \"a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga.\"[279] Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche \"[r]hythmically and melodically\", but was described as \"sharper, tougher than what came before\", incorporating genres such as R&amp;B, disco and funk.[61][280]\nSpears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop[281][282] and dance music in her records, as well as influences of urban and hip hop which are most present in In the Zone and Blackout.[282][283][284] Femme Fatale and Britney Jean were also heavily influenced by electronic music genres.[285][286]\nThe music found on ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again generally explores themes such as love and relationships from a teenager's point of view.[287][288] After the enormous success of her first two studio albums, Spears's team and producers wanted to maintain the formula that took her to the top of the charts.[287] Spears, however, was no longer satisfied with the sound and themes covered on her records. She cowrote five songs and choose each track's producer on Britney, her third studio album, which lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood, sexuality and self-discovery.[61][287][280] Sex, dancing, freedom and love continued to be Spears's music main subjects on her subsequent albums.[283][284][286][285] Her fifth studio album, Blackout, also address issues such as media scrutiny and fame, most notably in \"Piece of Me\".[284][289]\n Spears is a soprano.[294][295][296][297] Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung \"much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today\", with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears for her debut album ...Baby One More Time, being cited as \"[shaping] her voice over the course of a month\" upon being signed to Jive Records \"to where it is today\u2014distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[29] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, \"I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice.\"[298]\nGuy Blackman of The Age wrote that \"[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. [...] Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability.\"[299] Producer William Orbit, who collaborated with Spears on her album Britney Jean, stated regarding her vocals: \"[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing\".[300]\nSpears has also been criticized for her reliance on auto-tune[301] and her vocals being \"over-processed\" on records.[302] Erlewine criticized Spears's poor singing abilities in a review for Blackout, saying, \"Never the greatest vocalist, her thin squawk could be dismissed early in her career as an adolescent learning the ropes, but nearly a decade later her singing hasn't gotten any better, even if the studio tools to masquerade her weaknesses have.\"[284] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe remarked that \"Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.\"[303] The Michigan Daily's Kayla Upadhyaya provided a different point of view, saying, \"Auto-tuned and over-processed vocals define Britney's voice as an artist, and in her music, auto-tune isn't so much a gimmick as it is an instrument used to highlight, contort and make a statement.\"[304]\nSpears is known for her stage performances, particularly the elaborate dance routines which incorporate \"belly-dancing and tempered erotic moves\" that are credited for influencing \"dance-heavy acts\" such as Danity Kane and the Pussycat Dolls.[305][306] Rolling Stone magazine readers voted Spears as the second Favorite Dancing Musician.[307] Spears is described as being much more shy than what her stage persona suggests.[308][309][310] She claimed that performing is \"a boost to [her] confidence. It's like an alter-ego type thing. Something clicks and I go and turn into this different person. I think it's kind of a gift to be able to do that.\"[311] Her 2000, 2001, and 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performances received praise,[312] while her 2007 presentation was widely panned by critics, as she \"teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words\".[313] Billboard called her 2016 \"comeback\" performance at the show \"An effective, but not entirely glorious, bid to regain pop superstardom\".[296]\nAfter her knee injuries and personal struggles, Spears's \"showmanship\" and dance abilities came under criticism.[305][314] Serge F. Kovaleski of The New York Times watched her Las Vegas concert residency in 2016 and said: \"Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets.\"[315] Las Vegas Sun's Robin Leach seemed more impressed over Spears's efforts on the concert by saying that she delivered a \"flawless performance\" on the residency's opening night.[316]\nIt has been widely reported that Spears lip-syncs during live performances,[306][317][318] which often draws criticism from music critics and concert goers.[314][319][320] Some, however, claimed that, although she \"got plenty of digital support\", she \"doesn't merely lip-sync\" during her live shows.[321] In 2016, Sabrina Weiss of Refinery29 referred to her lip-syncing as a \"well-known fact that's not even taboo anymore.\"[322] Noting on the prevalence of lip-syncing, Los Angeles Daily News opined: \"In the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? [...] you [just] go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all\".[323] Spears spoke on the topic saying \"[...] Because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback.\" She added: \"It really pisses me off because I'm busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever gives me credit for it, you know?\"[317]\nSpears rose to fame as a bubblegum pop singer in the late 1990s and was labelled as a teen idol.[324][325] Rolling Stone magazine described Spears in her early years of fame as \"the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm.\"[326] The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing an open top revealing her bra, and shorts.[326] The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\" and called on \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.\" Spears responded to the outcry commenting, \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.\"[327] Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a virgin until marriage.[25][328]\nBillboard opined that, by the time she released her second album Oops!... I Did it Again, \"There was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image: She was sharper, sexier and singing about more grown-up fare, setting the stage for 2001\u2019s Britney\".[329] Britney's lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and its video were also credited for distancing her from her \"wholesome bubblegum star\" image of the past.[324][330] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, \"If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.\" Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated \"maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[283]\nSpears's erratic behavior and personal struggles during 2006\u20142008 were highly publicised[331] and affected both her career and public image.[284][332] Erlewine reflected on that time of her career by saying that \"each new disaster [was] stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image\".[284] Spears later received favorable media attention. Time's Cady Lang observed that she looked healthier during her appearance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards,[312] while Business Insider wrote an article about how Spears \"lost control of her life [...] and then made an incredible career comeback\".[333]\nIn September 2002, she was ranked eight on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list,[334] and, in December 2012, Complex ranked her 12 on its 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time list.[335] Spears commented on her sex symbol image by saying, \"[...] When I'm on stage, that's my time to do my thing and go there and be that \u2014 and it's fun. It's exhilarating just to be something that you're not. And people tend to believe it.\"[287] In 2003, People cited her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[336]\nSpears is also recognized as a gay icon. She was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[233] Billboard's Patrick Crowley reflected on her winning the award, \"While it's no secret that LGBTQ fans saw their struggle reflected in Spears' particularly rough mid-career slump, followed by her phoenix-like rise back to the top of the charts\u2014it's really her outstanding advocacy for the community that earned her this award.\"[337] Manuel Betancourt of Vice magazine wrote about the \"queer adoration\", especially of gay men, on Spears, and said that \"Where other gay icons exude self-possession, Spears's fragile resilience has made her an even more fascinating role model, closer to Judy Garland than to Lady Gaga [...] she's a glittering mirror ball, a fractured reflection of those men on the dance floor back onto themselves.\"[308]\nSince her early years of stardom, Spears become a tabloid fixture and a paparazzi target, which affected her personal life as well.[329][338][328] Steve Huey of AllMusic claimed that \"among female singers of [Spears's] era [...] her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez.\"[328] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[339] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[340] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000\u20132009.[341] E!'s Melanie Bromley described her 2007 highly publicised breakdown as \"one of the biggest public meltdowns in pop culture history.\"[338] She reflected on that time of her life in a 2017 interview, saying \"I think I had to give myself more breaks through my career and take responsibility for my mental health. [...] I wrote back then, that I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. I was trying to please everyone around me because that\u2019s who I am deep inside. There are moments where I look back and think: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"[342]\nAs a public figure, Spears \"has never been very publicly political\".[343] In October 2001, she registered as a Republican in Louisiana, according to public records.[343] In a September 2003 interview on CNN, she spoke about the then-U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, by saying that \"we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes [...] and be faithful in what happens\".[343][344] In 2016, she posted photos of a meeting with Hillary Clinton on her social media.[343]\nSpears was described by Rolling Stone magazine as \"One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 2000s\", which also pointed out that she, alongside other acts, \"spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop.\"[276] Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote in 2000: \"Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena\u00a0\u2014 a child with a full-time career. [...] Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry.\"[345] Billboard's Robert Kelly observed that Spears's \"sexy and coy\" vocals on her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\" \"kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come.\"[346] Spears has been recognised with a number of honorific nicknames, most notably the \"Princess of Pop.\"[347][348]\nBillboard claimed that she \"has earned her title as one of pop's reigning queens. Since her early days as a Mouseketeer, [Spears] has pushed the boundaries of 21st century sounds, paving the way for a generation of artists to shamelessly embrace glossy pop and redefine how one can accrue consistent success in the music industry.\"[329] In 2012, she was ranked as the fourth VH1's 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era show list.[349] VH1 also cited her among its choices on the 100 Greatest Women in Music in 2012[350] and the 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons in 2003.[351] NME critics ranked her single \"Toxic\" at number 92 on the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, writing that the song \"reinvented popular dance music.\"[352]\nIn 2011, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly commented on Spears's voice and music: \"We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer [...] we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. [...] She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. [...] Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls.\"[353]\nIn 2018, Rolling Stone included Spears on its Millennial 100 list and said that, following the release of her music career in the late 1990s, she \"quickly became the princess of pop, helping to usher in a new era for the genre that had gone dormant in the decade that followed New Kids on the Block. [...] Spears would lead an army of pop stars... built on slick Max Martin productions, plenty of sexual innuendo and dance-heavy performances. [She became] one of the most successful artists of all time \u2014 and a cautionary tale for a generation, whether they paid attention or not.\"[354]\nSpears's work has influenced artists including Taylor Swift,[355] Katy Perry,[356] Meghan Trainor,[357] Demi Lovato,[356] Kelly Key,[358] Kristinia DeBarge,[359] Little Boots,[360] Charli XCX,[361] Marina Diamandis,[362] Tegan and Sara,[363] Pixie Lott,[364] Grimes,[365] Selena Gomez,[366] Hailee Steinfeld,[367] Tinashe,[368] Victoria Justice,[369] Cassie,[370] Leah Wellbaum of Slothrust,[371] The Saturdays,[372] Normani,[373] Miley Cyrus,[374] Cheryl,[375] Lana Del Rey,[376] Ava Max,[377] and Billie Eilish.[378] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears \"taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.\"[379] Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her \"the most provocative performer of my time.\"[380] Before Spears joined The X Factor, Simon Cowell explained that he is \"fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about \u2013 not just pop stars \u2013 but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. [...] She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.\"[381] Marina Diamandis named Spears as the main influence behind her album Electra Heart.[382] Lana Del Rey has said that the music video for \"Toxic\" inspires her.[383] Spears has had a direct influence on singer Porcelain Black's work after growing up around her music as a child. Black describes her music as a \"love child between\" Marilyn Manson and Spears.[384]\nSpears's much-publicized personal struggles and her career comeback after this period has inspired some artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character in 2010 drama film Country Strong was inspired by the singer's treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, \"that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.\"[385] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears's comeback after her much-publicized personal issues as an inspiration.[386] Spears's hounding by paparazzi and personal struggles also contributed to inspiring Barry Manilow's album 15 Minutes. Manilow said: \"She couldn't have a life without them pulling up next to her car and following her and driving her crazy to the point where, that was around the time she shaved off her hair. [...] We all looked at it in horror [...] So it seemed like a thing to be writing an album about.\"[387] Bebo Norman wrote a song about Spears, called \"Britney\", which was inspired by \"culture's make-or-break treatment of celebrities.\"[388]\nSpears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award; the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; the GLAAD Media Award's Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nShe is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the \"Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist\" for her debut album ...Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.[389] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: \"She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide\".[390]\nAs of 2017[update], according to Billboard, she has sold 150 million records worldwide,[7] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time; and more than 70 million records in United States, including 36.9 million digital singles and 33.6 million digital albums.[8][9] Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s in the United States, as well as the fifth overall.[11] In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.[6] She is one of the few artists in history to have had a number one single and a number one studio album in the US during each of the three decades of her career.[391] With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.[144] In 2016, Spears ranked at number twenty on Billboard's Greatest Of All Time Top Dance Club Artists list.[392]\nIn 2000, the singer released a limited edition of sunglasses titled Shades of Britney.[393] In 2001, Spears signed a deal with shoe company Skechers,[394] and a $7\u20138\u00a0million promotional deal with Pepsi, their biggest entertainment deal at the time.[395] Aside from numerous commercials with the latter during that year, she also appeared in a 2004 Pepsi television commercial in the theme of \"Gladiators\" with singers Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[396] On June 19, 2002, she released her first multi-platform video game, Britney's Dance Beat, which received positive reviews.[397] In March 2009, Spears was announced as the new face of clothing brand Candie's.[398] Dari Marder, chief marketing officer for the brand, explained why they choose the singer, saying, \"everybody loves a comeback and nobody's doing it better than Britney. She's just poised for even greater success.\"[398] In 2010, Spears designed a limited edition line for the brand, which was released in stores in July 2010.[139] In 2011, she teamed up with Sony, Make Up For Ever and PlentyofFish to release her music video for \"Hold It Against Me\", earning her $500,000 for the product placement.[399] Spears also teamed up with Hasbro in 2012 to release an exclusive version of Twister Dance, which includes a remix of \"Till the World Ends\". The singer was also featured on a commercial, which was directed by Ray Kay, to promote the game. Spears was also featured on the commercial of \"Twister Rave\" and the game included a Twister remix of \"Circus\".[400] In March 2018, it was revealed that Spears would be the face of KENZO, a contemporary French luxury clothing house.[231]\nSpears's range of commercial deals and products also includes beauty care products and perfumes. She released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious in 2004, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[25] By 2009, she had released seven more perfumes including Fantasy.[401][402] In 2010, Spears released her eighth fragrance, Radiance. In March 2011, company Brand Sense filed a lawsuit against Spears and Elizabeth Arden seeking $10\u00a0million in damages, claiming that the singer and her father, Jamie, stopped paying their thirty-five percent commission that was agreed as part of the contract terms.[403] In July 2011, a Los Angeles judge denied the request by the company lawyers, claiming the fact that Spears is still under conservatorship.[404] Brand Sense, however, stated that they would appeal the decision.[404] In 2011, Radiance was re-issued as a new perfume titled Cosmic Radiance.[405] Worldwide, Spears sold over one million bottles in the first five years, with gross receipts of $1.5\u00a0billion. In 2016, Spears contacted Glu Mobile to create her own role-playing game, Britney Spears: American Dream. The app officially launched in May 2016 and is compatible with IOS and Android.[204] On June 17, 2016, Spears announced the release of her twentieth fragrance, Private Show.[406] As of January\u00a02018[update], Spears has released 24 fragrances through Elizabeth Arden.[407]\nThe singer founded The Britney Spears Foundation, a charitable entity set up to help children in need. The philosophy behind the Foundation was that music and entertainment has a healing quality that can benefit children.[408] The Foundation also supported the annual Britney Spears Camp for the Performing Arts, where campers had the opportunity to explore and develop their talents.[409] In April 2002, through the efforts of Spears and The Britney Spears Foundation, a grant of $1\u00a0million was made to the Twin Towers Fund to support the children of uniformed service heroes affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including New York City Fire Department and its Emergency Medical Services Command, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State Office of court Administration and other government offices.[410] However, it was reported in 2008 that the Foundation had a deficit of $200,000.[411] After the singer went through conservatorship, her father and lawyer Andrew Wallet zeroed out the effort, leading to its closure in 2011.[412]\nOn October 30, 2001, Spears, alongside Bono and other popular recording artists under the name \"Artists Against AIDS Worldwide\", released a single titled \"What's Going On\", with the intention to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and other impoverished regions.[413] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2006, Spears donated $350,000 to Music Rising.[414] Later in 2011, the singer raised $200,000 during An Evening of Southern Style at a private residence in Beverly Hills to benefit the St. Bernard Project, with the help of several celebrities, including Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Kellan Lutz and Kim Kardashian.[415] Spears has also helped several charities during her career, including Madonna's Kabbalah-based Spirituality for Kids,[416] cancer charity Gilda's Club Worldwide,[417] Promises Foundation, and United Way, with the latter two focused on giving families from various disadvantaged situations new hope and stable foundations for the future.[414]\nOn October 24, 2015, Spears donated $120,000 to the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.[418] In addition, $1 of each ticket sale for her Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, was donated to the nonprofit organization.[419] Spears also fundraised for the charity through social media, in addition to selling limited edition merchandise, with all proceeds going to the NCCF.[420] On October 27, 2016, Spears partnered with Zappos and XCYCLE to host the Britney Spears Piece of Me Charity Ride in Boca Park, Las Vegas to raise additional money toward her goal of $1\u00a0million for the NCCF, with $450,000 having already been raised from Spears's ticket sales and merchandise.[421] Participants were entered for a chance to win a spin class with Spears herself. The event ultimately went on to raise $553,130.[422] The fundraising ultimately led to the development of the NCCF Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas, which saw its grand opening on November 4, 2017.[423] Spears also regularly participates in Spirit Day to combat bullying of LGBTQ youth and bullying.[424]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nCourtney Michelle Love (n\u00e9e Harrison; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. A figure in the punk and grunge scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the lead vocalist of the alternative rock band Hole, which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. In 2020, NME named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"[1] Born to countercultural parents in San Francisco, Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in Portland, Oregon, where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in Dublin and Liverpool before returning to the United States and was cast in the Alex Cox films Sid and Nancy (1986) and Straight to Hell (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's 1991 debut album, produced by Kim Gordon. Hole's second release, Live Through This (1994), was met with critical accolades and multi-platinum sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance as Althea Leasure in Milo\u0161 Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), was nominated for three Grammy Awards. Love continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as Man on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, which resulted in a mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire. Love has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a manga, Princess Ai, between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love (2006). Courtney Michelle Harrison[a] was born on July 9, 1964, at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, California,[3] the first child of psychotherapist Linda Carroll (n\u00e9e Risi) and Hank Harrison, a publisher and road manager for the Grateful Dead.[4][5] Love's godfather is the founding Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh.[6][7] Her mother, who was adopted at birth and raised by a prominent Italian-Catholic family in San Francisco,[8] was later revealed to be the biological daughter of novelist Paula Fox;[9][10] Love's maternal great-grandmother was screenwriter Elsie Fox.[11] According to Love, she was named after Courtney Farrell, the protagonist of Pamela Moore's 1956 novel Chocolates for Breakfast.[12] She is of Cuban, English, German, Irish, and Welsh descent.[13] \u2013Love on her childhood[14] Love spent her early years in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco until her parents' 1969 divorce, spurred by her mother's allegations that her father had fed Courtney LSD when she was a toddler.[15][16] Though he denied the claim, full custody of Love was awarded to her mother.[17] In 1970, Carroll relocated with Love to the rural community of Marcola, Oregon where they lived along the Mohawk River[18] while she completed her psychology degree at the University of Oregon.[19] There, Love was adopted by her then-stepfather, Frank Rodriguez.[18] He and her mother had two daughters and a son who died in infancy of a heart defect when Love was ten; they also adopted a boy.[20] Love attended a Montessori school in Eugene, where she struggled academically and had trouble making friends.[21][22] At age nine, a psychologist noted that she exhibited signs of autism.[14][21][23] In 1972, Love's mother divorced Rodriguez, remarried, and moved the family to Nelson, New Zealand.[24] There, she enrolled Love at Nelson College for Girls,[25] from which she was soon expelled.[26] In 1973, she was sent back to live in the United States, where she was raised in Portland, Oregon[27] by her former stepfather and other family friends.[28][29] During this time, her mother gave birth to two of Love's other half-brothers.[18] At age fourteen, she was arrested for shoplifting a T-shirt from a Woolworth's,[30] and was sent to Hillcrest Correctional Facility, a juvenile hall in Salem, Oregon.[22][31] She was subsequently placed in foster care until she became legally emancipated at age 16.[16] She supported herself by working illegally as a topless dancer[32] at Mary's Club in downtown Portland[33] adopting the last name \"Love\" to conceal her identity; she later adopted \"Love\" as her surname.[18] She also worked various odd jobs, including picking berries at a farm in Troutdale, Oregon,[34][35] and as a disc jockey at a gay disco.[36] During this time, she enrolled at Portland State University, studying English and philosophy.[37][38] Love has said that she \"didn't have a lot of social skills,\"[39] and that she learned them while frequenting gay clubs and spending time with drag queens.[40] In 1981, she was granted a small trust fund that had been left by her adoptive grandparents, which she used to travel to Dublin, Ireland, where her biological father was living.[41] While there, she enrolled in courses at Trinity College, studying theology for two semesters.[42][43] She would later receive honorary patronage from Trinity's University Philosophical Society in 2010.[44] After leaving Trinity, Love relocated to Liverpool, where she became acquainted with musician Julian Cope and his band, The Teardrop Explodes, and briefly lived in his house.[45] \"They kind of took me in\", she recalled. \"I was sort of a mascot; I would get them coffee or tea during rehearsal.\"[46] In Cope's autobiography Head-On, Love is referred to as \"the adolescent.\"[47] After spending a year abroad, Love returned to Portland: \"I thought that [going to the United Kingdom] was my peak life experience,\" she said in 2011. \"\u2014that nothing else [would] happen to me again.\"[48] In 1983, she took short-lived jobs working as an erotic dancer in Japan and later Taiwan, but was deported after the club was shut down by the government.[49][50] Love began several music projects in the 1980s, first forming Sugar Babylon (later Sugar Babydoll)[b] in Portland with her friends Ursula Wehr and Robin Barbur.[52] In 1982, Love attended a Faith No More concert in San Francisco and convinced the members to let her join as a singer.[53][54] The group recorded material with Love as a vocalist, but she was subsequently kicked out of the band. According to the Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum, who remained Love's friend in the years after, the band wanted a \"male energy.\"[55] She later formed the Pagan Babies with friend Kat Bjelland, whom she met at the Satyricon club in Portland in 1984.[56] As Love later reflected, \"The best thing that ever happened to me in a way, was Kat.\"[57] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they recruited bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka.[58] According to Bjelland, \"[Courtney] didn't play an instrument at the time\" aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her.[22] The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985.[58][59] After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.[22] Drummer Lori Barbero and bassist Maureen Herman recalled Courtney's departure 'She lived in my house for a little while. And then we did a concert at the Orpheum. It was in 1988. It was called O-88 with Butthole Surfers, Cows & Bastards, Run Westy Run, and Babes in Toyland. And I guess Maureen took Courtney to the airport after she stole all the money'. 'She stayed and stayed, and then the next day she wanted me to take her to the airport. And so I drove her to the airport. She had just had some weird fight with the guy at the desk, and then she left. She said, \u201cI'm going to go to L.A. and I'm going to get my face done and I'm going to be famous.' - 'And then she did' [60] Deciding to shift her focus to acting, Love enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute[61] and studied film under experimental director George Kuchar.[62][63] Love was featured in one of his short films, titled Club Vatican.[64][65][66] In 1985 she submitted an audition tape for the role of Nancy Spungen in the Sid Vicious biopic Sid and Nancy (1986), and was given a minor supporting role by director Alex Cox.[67][68] After filming Sid and Nancy in New York City, she worked at a peep show in Times Square and squatted at the ABC No Rio social center and Pyramid Club in the East Village.[69][70] The same year, Cox cast her in a leading role in his film Straight to Hell (1987),[71] a spaghetti western starring Joe Strummer and Grace Jones filmed in Spain in 1986.[72] The film caught the attention of Andy Warhol, who featured Love in an episode of Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes.[73] She also had a part in the 1988 Ramones music video for \"I Wanna Be Sedated,\" appearing as a bride among dozens of party guests.[74][75][76] In 1988, Love aborted her acting career and left New York, returning to the West Coast, citing the \"celebutante\" fame she'd attained as the central reason.[77] She returned to stripping in the small town of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar.[78] This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to \"gather her thoughts,\" supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen.[79] \"I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work\", she said in retrospect. \"So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers.\"[80] \u2013Don Fleming, who co-produced Hole's debut album with Kim Gordon, on Love[81] At the end of 1988, Love taught herself to play guitar and relocated to Los Angeles,[82] where she placed an ad in a local music zine: \"I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, and Fleetwood Mac.\"[83] Love recruited lead guitarist Eric Erlandson; Lisa Roberts, her neighbor, as bassist; and drummer Caroline Rue, whom she met at a Gwar concert.[84] Love named the band Hole after a line from Euripides' Medea[85] (\"There is a hole that pierces right through me\")[86] as well as a conversation she had had with her mother, in which she told her that she couldn't live her life \"with a hole running through her.\"[87] Love's marriage to James Moreland (vocalist of The Leaving Trains) was brief, ending in an annulment.[88] After forming Hole, she and bandmate Eric Erlandson had a romantic relationship that lasted over a year.[89] In the band's formative stages, Love continued to work at strip clubs in Hollywood (including Jumbo's Clown Room and the Seventh Veil),[83]saving money to purchase backline equipment and a touring van,[90] while rehearsing at a studio in Hollywood that was loaned to her by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.[91] Hole played their first show in November 1989 at Raji's, a rock club in central Hollywood.[92] The band's debut single, \"Retard Girl\", was issued in April 1990 through the Long Beach indie label Sympathy for the Record Industry, and was given airtime by Rodney Bingenheimer's show on local rock station KROQ.[22] That fall, the band appeared on the cover of Flipside, a Los Angeles-based punk fanzine.[84] In early 1991, the band released their second single, \"Dicknail\", through Sub Pop Records.[93] With no wave, noise rock and grindcore bands being major influences on Love,[84] Hole's first studio album, Pretty on the Inside, captured a particularly abrasive sound and contained disturbing, graphic lyrics,[94][95] described by Q magazine as \"confrontational [and] genuinely uninhibited.\"[96] The record was released in September 1991 on Caroline Records, produced by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth with assistant production from Gumball's Don Fleming; Love and Gordon had initially met when Hole opened for Sonic Youth during their promotional tour for Goo at the Whisky a Go Go in November 1990.[97] In early 1991, Love sent Gordon a personal letter asking her to produce the record for the band, to which she agreed.[95][98] Though Love would later say Pretty on the Inside was \"unlistenable\" and \"[un]melodic,\"[99] the album received generally positive critical reception from indie and punk rock critics[100] and was labeled one of the twenty best albums of the year by Spin magazine.[101] It also gained a following in the United Kingdom, charting at 59 on the UK Albums Chart,[102] and its lead single, \"Teenage Whore\", entered the country's indie chart at number one.[103] The underlying feminist slant of some of the album's songs led many to mistakenly tag the band as being part of the riot grrrl movement,[104] a movement with which Love did not associate.[105][106] The band toured in support of the record, headlining with Mudhoney in Europe; in the United States, they opened for the Smashing Pumpkins,[107] and performed at CBGB in New York City.[108] During this tour, Love briefly dated Billy Corgan of the rock band the Smashing Pumpkins[109] before formally dating Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain.[110] It is uncertain when they first met, and there are varying accounts of how they came to know one another.[c] Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum.[112] According to Love, she first met him at a Dharma Bums show in Portland,[113][114] while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain in a parking lot after a Butthole Surfers/L7 concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991.[89] Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became re-acquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.[115][116] and were officially a couple by the close of 1991.[117][118] \u2013Love on her public image after marrying Kurt Cobain[119] Shortly after completing the tour for Pretty on the Inside, Love married Cobain on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 24, 1992.[120] She wore a satin and lace dress once owned by actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore plaid pajamas.[121] During Love's pregnancy, Hole recorded a cover of \"Over the Edge\" for a Wipers tribute album,[122] and recorded their fourth single, \"Beautiful Son\", which was released in April 1993. On August 18 of that year, the couple's only child, a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born in Los Angeles.[120] The couple subsequently relocated to Carnation, Washington and then to Seattle.[123][124] Love's first major media exposure came in a September 1992 profile of herself and Cobain for Vanity Fair by journalist Lynn Hirschberg, entitled \"Strange Love.\"[125] After being asked to participate in a cover story for the magazine, Love was urged by her manager to accept the request.[126] In the year prior, Love and Cobain had developed a heroin addiction, and the profile painted the couple in an unflattering light and suggested that Love had been addicted to heroin during her pregnancy.[127] The article ultimately resulted in the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigating, and custody of Love and Cobain's newborn daughter, Frances, was temporarily awarded to Love's sister, Jaimee.[128] Love claimed she was misquoted by Hirschberg, and asserted that she had immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant.[126][129][130] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state,[131][132][133] suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.[126][134] On September 8, 1993, Love and Cobain made their only public performance together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Hollywood, performing two acoustic duets of \"Pennyroyal Tea\" and \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night.\"[135] Love also performed electric versions of two new Hole songs, \"Doll Parts\" and \"Miss World,\" both written for the band's upcoming second album.[135] In October 1993, Hole recorded their second album, Live Through This, in Atlanta. The album featured a new lineup with bassist Kristen Pfaff and drummer Patty Schemel. Live Through This was released on Geffen's subsidiary label DGC in April 1994, four days after Cobain died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in their Seattle home while Love was in rehab in Los Angeles.[136] In the following months, Love was rarely seen in public, holing up in her Seattle home with friends and family members. After the cremation of Cobain's remains, Love divided portions of his ashes, keeping some in a teddy bear and some in an urn.[137] In June 1994, she traveled to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York, where she had his ashes ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks, and a portion were mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures.[137] On June 16, 1994, Hole's bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose in Seattle.[138] For the band's impending tour, Love recruited Canadian bassist Melissa Auf der Maur.[139] Live Through This was a commercial and critical success,[140][141][142] hitting platinum RIAA certification in April 1995 and receiving numerous critical accolades.[75] The success of the record combined with Cobain's suicide resulted in a high level of publicity for Love, and she was featured on Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People in 1995.[143] Simultaneously, her erratic onstage behavior and various legal troubles during Hole's 1994\u20131995 world tour compounded the media coverage of her.[144] Hole's performance on August 26, 1994 at the Reading Festival\u2014 Love's first public performance following Cobain's death[145][146]\u2014was described by MTV as \"by turns macabre, frightening and inspirational.\"[147] John Peel wrote in The Guardian that Love's disheveled appearance \"would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam\", and that her performance \"verged on the heroic\u00a0... Love steered her band through a set which dared you to pity either her recent history or that of the band\u00a0... the band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage.\"[148] The band performed a series of riotous concerts over the following year, with Love frequently appearing hysterical onstage, flashing crowds, stage diving, and getting into fights with audience members.[145][149] One journalist reported that at the band's show in Boston in December 1994, \"Love interrupted the music and talked about her deceased husband Kurt Cobain, and also broke out into Tourette syndrome-like rants. The music was great, but the raving was vulgar and offensive, and prompted some of the audience to shout back at her.\"[150] The tour was also marked by a series of legal troubles for Love: In January 1995, she was arrested in Melbourne for disrupting a Qantas Airways flight after getting into an argument with a stewardess.[151] On July 4, 1995, at the Lollapalooza Festival in George, Washington, Love threw a lit cigarette at musician Kathleen Hanna before punching her in the face, alleging that Hanna had made a joke about her daughter.[152] She pleaded guilty to an assault charge and was sentenced to anger management classes.[153][154] In November 1995, two male teenagers attempted to sue Love for allegedly punching them during a Hole concert they attended in Orlando, Florida in March 1995. The judge ultimately dismissed the case on grounds that the teens \"weren't exposed to any greater amount of violence than could reasonably be expected at an alternative rock concert.\"[155] Love would later say that she retained little memory of 1994\u20131995,[91] blaming the fact that she had been using large quantities of heroin and Rohypnol at the time.[91][156] \u2013Love on her role in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)[157] After Hole's world tour concluded in 1996, Love made a return to acting, first in small roles in the Jean-Michel Basquiat biopic Basquiat and the drama Feeling Minnesota (1996),[158] before landing the co-starring role of Larry Flynt's wife Althea in Milo\u0161 Forman's critically acclaimed 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt. In order to appear in the film, Love went through rehabilitation and quit using heroin at the insistence of Forman; she was ordered to take multiple urine tests under the supervision of Columbia Pictures while filming the movie, and passed all of them.[159][160] Despite Columbia Pictures' initial reluctance to hire Love due to her troubled past,[159] she received critical acclaim for her performance in the film after its release in December 1996, earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress,[161] and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress.[162] Critic Roger Ebert called her work in the film \"quite a performance; Love proves she is not a rock star pretending to act, but a true actress.\"[163] She won several other awards from various film critic associations for the film.[164][165] During this time, Love maintained what the media noted as a more decorous public image,[166] and she appeared in ad campaigns for Versace[167][168][169] and in a Vogue Italia spread.[170] Following the release of The People vs. Larry Flynt, she dated her co-star Edward Norton, with whom she remained until 1999.[171][172] In late 1997, Hole released a compilation album and extended play, both of which featured previously-recorded material. Love subsequently attracted media attention in May 1998 after punching journalist Belissa Cohen in the face at a party; the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.[173] In September 1998, Hole released their third studio album, Celebrity Skin, which featured a stark power pop sound that contrasted with the group's earlier punk influences.[174] Love divulged her ambition of making an album where \"art meets commerce\u00a0... there are no compromises made, it has commercial appeal, and it sticks to [our] original vision.\"[174] She said she was influenced by Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, and My Bloody Valentine when writing the album.[174][175] Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan co-wrote several songs on the album. Celebrity Skin was well received by critics; Rolling Stone called it \"accessible, fiery and intimate\u2014often at the same time\u00a0... a basic guitar record that's anything but basic\".[176] Celebrity Skin went multi-platinum, and topped \"Best of Year\" lists at Spin and The Village Voice.[75] The album garnered the band their only No.\u00a01 hit single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart with the title track \"Celebrity Skin\".[177] The band promoted the album through MTV performances and at the 1998 Billboard Music Awards,[178] and were subsequently nominated for three Grammy Awards at the 41st Grammy Awards ceremony.[179] Hole toured with Marilyn Manson on the Beautiful Monsters Tour in 1999, but dropped out of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over production costs between Love and Manson, in addition to the fact that Hole was forced to open for Manson under an agreement with Interscope Records.[180] Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen.[181][182] Love would later make claims that an additional reason the band left the tour was due to Manson and Korn's (whom they also toured with in Australia) sexualized treatment of teenage female audience members.[183] Love told interviewers at 99X.FM in Atlanta: \"What I really don't like\u2014there are certain girls that like us, or like me, who are really messed up... and they do not need to be\u2014they're very young\u2014and they do not need to be taken and raped, or filmed having enema contests... going out into the audience and picking up fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls who obviously cut themselves, and then having to see them in the morning... it's just uncool.\"[180] Before the release and promotion of Celebrity Skin, Love and Fender designed a low-priced Squier brand guitar, called Vista Venus.[184] The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, a little-known independent guitar manufacturer,[185] Stratocaster, and Rickenbacker's solid body guitars and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions.[185] In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: \"I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty\u00a0... And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted it real simple, with just one pickup switch.\"[184] In 1999, Love was awarded an Orville H. Gibson award for Best Female Rock Guitarist.[186] During this time, she also starred opposite Jim Carrey as his longtime partner Lynne Margulies in the Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon (1999), which was followed with a role as William S. Burroughs's wife Joan Vollmer in Beat (2000) alongside Kiefer Sutherland.[187] Love was cast as the lead in John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film Ghosts of Mars, but backed out of the role after injuring her foot.[188] She subsequently sued the ex-wife of her then-boyfriend, James Barber, whom Love alleged ran over her foot with her Volvo in a parking lot, causing the injury.[189] The following year, she returned to film opposite Lili Taylor in Julie Johnson (2001), a drama in which she played a woman who has a lesbian relationship; Love won an Outstanding Actress award at L.A.'s Outfest.[190] She was then cast in the thriller Trapped (2002), alongside Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron.[191] The film was a box office flop, earning $13 million against a $30 million budget.[192] In the interim, Hole had become dormant,[179][193] and in March 2001, Love began a \"punk rock femme supergroup\" called Bastard, enlisting Schemel, Veruca Salt co-frontwoman Louise Post, and bassist Gina Crosley.[194] Post recalled of the group: \"[Love] was like, 'Listen, you guys: I've been in my Malibu, manicure, movie star world for two years, alright? I wanna make a record. And let's leave all that grunge shit behind us, eh? We were being so improvisational, and singing together, and with a trust developing between us. It was the shit.\"[195] The group recorded a demo tape, but by September 2001, Post and Crosley had left the band, with Post citing \"unhealthy and unprofessional working conditions.\"[196][197] In May 2002, Hole formally announced their breakup amid continuing litigation with Universal Music Group over their record contract.[198] After the breakup of Hole, Love began composing material with songwriter Linda Perry, and in July 2003 signed a contract with Virgin Records.[199] She began recording her new album, titled America's Sweetheart, in France shortly after.[200] A total of 32 songs were recorded during these sessions.[199] A series of legal issues simultaneously occurred during this period: In February 2003, Love had been banned from Virgin Airlines after being arrested at Heathrow Airport for disrupting a flight.[201] In October of that year, she was arrested in Los Angeles after breaking several windows of her producer and then-boyfriend James Barber's home, and was charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance;[202] the ordeal resulted in her temporarily losing custody of her daughter.[203] Virgin Records released America's Sweetheart in February 2004, upon which it received mixed reviews.[204] Charles Aaron of Spin called it a \"jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This\" and awarded it eight out of ten stars,[205] while Amy Phillips of The Village Voice wrote: \"[Love is] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever wanted to have a glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?\"[206] The album sold less than 100,000 copies.[75] Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record,[207] reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame.[208] Shortly after the record was released, she told Kurt Loder on TRL: \"I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke.\"[209] On March 17, 2004, Love appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote the recently released America's Sweetheart.[210] Her appearance drew media coverage when, during the interview segment, she lifted her shirt multiple times,[211] flashed Letterman, and stood on his desk.[210] A New York Times article noted: \"The episode was not altogether surprising for Ms. Love, 39, whose most public moments have veered from extreme pathos\u2014like the time she read the suicide note of her famous husband, Kurt Cobain, on MTV\u2014to angry feminism to catfights to incoherent ranting.\"[212] Hours later, in the early morning of March 18, Love was arrested in Manhattan for allegedly striking a 23-year-old male fan with a microphone stand during a small concert she performed at an East Village venue.[212] She was released within hours of the incident, enabling her to perform a concert scheduled for the following evening at the Bowery Ballroom.[212] Four days later, on March 22, she called in multiple times to The Howard Stern Show, claiming in broadcast conversations with Stern that the incident had not occurred, and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest.[213][214] On July 9, 2004, Love's 40th birthday, she was arrested for failing to make a court appearance for the March 2004 charges, and taken to Bellevue Hospital, allegedly incoherent, where she was placed on a 72-hour watch.[215] According to police, she was believed to be a potential \"danger to herself,\" but was deemed mentally sound and released to a rehab facility two days later.[216][217] Amidst public criticism and press coverage, comedian Margaret Cho published an opinion piece on her official website in defense of Love, titled \"Courtney [Love] Deserves Better from Feminists,\" arguing that negative associations of Love with her drug and personal problems (including from feminists) overshadowed discussion of her music and, more importantly, her personal well-being.[218] Love would ultimately plead guilty in October 2004 to disorderly conduct over the alleged striking of the audience member.[219] Her appearance as a roaster on the Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson in August 2005 attracted Love further media attention due to her appearing visibly intoxicated and disheveled.[220] One review of the program noted that Love \"acted as if she belonged in a [psychiatric] institution.\"[220] Six days after the show's airing, she was sentenced to a 28-day lockdown rehab program for allegedly being under the influence of a controlled substance, violating her probation.[221] To avoid jail time, she accepted an additional 180-day rehab sentence in September 2005.[222] In November 2005, after successfully completing the program, Love was discharged from the rehab center under the provision that she complete further outpatient rehab.[223] In subsequent interviews in the following years, she would admit to having been dealing with various addictions during this time to prescription drugs, cocaine, and crack cocaine.[224][225] She has stated she has been sober since completing rehabilitation in 2007, and cited her Nichiren Buddhist practice (which she began in 1989)[226][227] as integral to her sobriety.[228][229] In the midst of her legal troubles, Love had endeavors in writing and publishing: She collaborated on a semi-autobiographical manga titled Princess Ai (Japanese: \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u00b7\u30a2\u30a4\u7269\u8a9e), which she co-wrote with Stu Levy. The manga was illustrated by Misaho Kujiradou and Ai Yazawa, and was released in three volumes in both the United States and Japan between 2004 and 2006.[230][231] Also in 2006, she published a memoir, Dirty Blonde, and began recording what would become her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean,[232] collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled \"Loser Dust\", during her time in rehab in 2005.[233] She told Billboard: \"My hand-eye coordination was so bad [after the drug use], I didn't even know chords anymore. It was like my fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise [in rehab]\u00a0... I never thought I would work again.\"[234] Tracks and demos for the album (planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled The Return of Courtney Love, detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network More4 in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of \"Never Go Hungry Again\", recorded during an interview for The Times in November, was also released. Incomplete audio clips of the song \"Samantha\", originating from an interview with NPR, were distributed on the internet in 2007.[235] In March 2009, fashion designer Dawn Simorangkir brought a libel suit against Love concerning a defamatory post Love made on her Twitter account,[236] which was eventually settled for $450,000.[237] Several months later, in June 2009, NME published an article detailing Love's plan to reunite Hole and release a new album, Nobody's Daughter.[238] In response, former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson stated in Spin magazine that contractually no reunion could take place without his involvement; therefore Nobody's Daughter would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a \"Hole\" record.[239] Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a Twitter post, claiming \"he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark\".[240] Nobody's Daughter was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist Micko Larkin, Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). Nobody's Daughter featured material written and recorded for Love's unfinished solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, including \"Pacific Coast Highway\", \"Letter to God\", \"Samantha\", and \"Never Go Hungry\", although they were re-produced in the studio with Larkin and engineer Michael Beinhorn.[241] The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk rock sound, and more acoustic guitar work than previous Hole albums.[242] The first single from Nobody's Daughter was \"Skinny Little Bitch\", released to promote the album in March 2010.[243] The album received mixed reviews.[244] Robert Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five, saying Love \"worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, America's Sweetheart\".[245] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also gave the album three out of five: \"It's Marianne Faithfull's substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like 'Honey' and 'For Once in Your Life'. The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date\u00a0... the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim.\"[246] Love and the band toured internationally from 2010 into late 2012 promoting the record, with their pre-release shows in London and at South by Southwest receiving critical acclaim.[207] In 2011, Love participated in Hit So Hard, a documentary chronicling bandmate Schemel's time in Hole.[99] In May 2012, Love debuted an art collection at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York titled \"And She's Not Even Pretty\",[247] which contained over forty drawings and paintings by Love composed in ink, colored pencil, pastels, and watercolors.[248][249] Later in the year, she collaborated with Michael Stipe on the track \"Rio Grande\" for Johnny Depp's sea shanty album Son of Rogues Gallery,[250] and in 2013, co-wrote and contributed vocals on \"Rat A Tat\" from Fall Out Boy's album Save Rock and Roll, also appearing in the song's music video.[251] After dropping the Hole name and performing as a solo artist[252] in late 2012,[253] Love appeared in spring 2013 advertisements for Yves Saint Laurent alongside Kim Gordon and Ariel Pink.[254] Love completed a solo tour of North America in mid-2013,[255][256] which was purported to be in promotion of an upcoming solo album; however, it was ultimately dubbed a \"greatest hits\" tour, and featured songs from Love's and Hole's back catalogue.[257] Love told Billboard at the time that she had recorded eight songs in the studio.[258] Love was subject of a second landmark libel lawsuit brought against her in January 2014 by her former attorney Rhonda Holmes, who accused Love of online defamation, seeking $8 million in damages.[259] It was the first case of alleged Twitter-based libel in U.S. history to make it to trial.[260] The jury, however, found in Love's favor.[259] A subsequent defamation lawsuit filed by fashion Simorangkir in February 2014, however, resulted in Love being ordered to pay a further $350,000 in recompense.[237] On April 22, 2014, Love debuted the song \"You Know My Name\" on BBC Radio 6 to promote her tour of the United Kingdom.[261] It was released as a double A-side single with the song \"Wedding Day\" on May 4, 2014, on her own label Cherry Forever Records via Kobalt Label Services.[262] The tracks were produced by Michael Beinhorn, and feature Tommy Lee on drums.[263] In an interview with the BBC, Love revealed that she and former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson had reconciled, and had been rehearsing new material together, along with former bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and drummer Patty Schemel, though she did not confirm a reunion of the band.[264] On May 1, 2014, in an interview with Pitchfork, Love commented further on the possibility of Hole reuniting, saying: \"I'm not going to commit to it happening, because we want an element of surprise. There's a lot of is to be dotted and ts to be crossed.\"[265][266] Love was cast in several television series in supporting parts throughout 2014 including the FX series Sons of Anarchy,[267] Revenge,[268] and Lee Daniels' network series Empire in a recurring guest role as Elle Dallas.[269] The track \"Walk Out on Me\" featuring Love was included on the Empire: Original Soundtrack from Season 1 album, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200.[270] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the track, saying: \"The idea of Courtney Love singing a ballad with a group of gospel singers seems faintly terrifying\u00a0... the reality is brilliant. Love's voice fits the careworn lyrics, effortlessly summoning the kind of ravaged darkness that Lana Del Rey nearly ruptures herself trying to conjure up.\"[271] In January 2015, Love starred in a New York City stage production titled Kansas City Choir Boy, a \"pop opera\" conceived by and co-starring Todd Almond.[272] Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised her performance, noting a \"soft-edged and bewitching\" stage presence, adding: \"Her voice, never the most supple or rangy of instruments, retains the singular sound that made her an electrifying front woman for the band Hole: a single sustained noted can seem to simultaneously contain a plea, a wound and a threat.\"[273] The show toured later in the year, with performances in Boston and Los Angeles.[274] Love saw further legal troubles in April 2015 when journalist Anthony Bozza sued her over an alleged contractual violation regarding his co-writing of her memoir.[275] Love subsequently joined Lana Del Rey on her Endless Summer Tour, performing as an opener on the tour's eight West Coast shows in May\u2013June 2015.[276] During her tenure on Del Rey's tour, Love debuted a new single, \"Miss Narcissist\", released on Wavves' independent label Ghost Ramp.[277] She also was cast in a supporting role in James Franco's film The Long Home, based on William Gay's novel of the same name, marking her first film role in over ten years.[278] In January 2016, Love released a clothing line in collaboration with Sophia Amoruso titled \"Love, Courtney\", featuring eighteen pieces reflecting her personal style.[279] In November 2016, she began filming the pilot for A Midsummer's Nightmare, a Shakespeare anthology series adapted for Lifetime.[280] She then starred as Kitty Menendez in Menendez: Blood Brothers, a biopic television film based on the lives of Lyle and Erik Menendez, which premiered on Lifetime in June 2017.[281] The same year, she was cast in Justin Kelly's biopic JT LeRoy, opposite Laura Dern, Kristen Stewart, Diane Kruger, and Kelvin Harrison Jr..[282] In March 2018, Love appeared in the music video for Marilyn Manson's \"Tattooed in Reverse,\"[283] which she followed with an April 5 guest-judge appearance on RuPaul's Drag Race.[284] In December 2018, Love filed and was awarded a restraining order against Sam Lutfi, who had acted as her manager for the previous six years, alleging verbal abuse and harassment.[285] Her daughter, Frances, and sister, Jaimee, were also awarded restraining orders against Lutfi.[285] In January 2019, a Los Angeles County judge extended the three-year duration of the order to a total of five years, citing Lutfi's apparent tendency to \"prey upon people.\"[286] On August 18, 2019, Love performed a solo set at the Yola D\u00eda festival in Los Angeles, which also featured performances by Cat Power and Lykke Li.[287] On September 9, Love garnered press attention when she publicly criticized Joss Sackler, an heiress to the Sackler family OxyContin fortune, after she allegedly offered Love $100,000 to attend her fashion show during New York Fashion Week.[288] In the same statement, Love indicated that she had relapsed into opioid addiction in 2018, stating that she had recently celebrated a year of sobriety.[288] On November 21, a new track, \"Mother,\" was released on the internet, as part of the soundtrack for the upcoming horror film The Turning (2020).[289] Love co-wrote the track with Lawrence Rothman, who also served as producer.[289] In January 2020, NME named Love as a recipient of the Icon Award, deeming her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"[1] Love has been candid about her diverse musical influences, the earliest being Patti Smith, The Runaways, and The Pretenders, artists she discovered while in juvenile hall at age fifteen.[290] As a child, her first exposure to music was records that her parents retrieved each month through Columbia Record Club.[291] The first record Love owned was Leonard Cohen's Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967), which she obtained from her mother: \"He was so lyric-conscious and morbid, and I was a pretty morbid kid,\" she recalled.[291] As a teenager, she named Flipper, Kate Bush, Soft Cell, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro,[292] Lou Reed, and Dead Kennedys among her favorite artists.[45] She has also spoken of her appreciation for new wave and post-punk bands she became acquainted with while living as a teenager in the United Kingdom, such as Echo and the Bunnymen,[293] The Smiths,[294] Siouxsie and the Banshees,[295] Television,[295] Bauhaus,[294] and Joy Division.[296] While in Dublin at age fifteen, Love attended a Virgin Prunes concert, an event she credited as being a pivotal influence: \"I had never seen so much sex, snarl, poetry, evil, restraint, grace, filth, raw power and the very essence of rock and roll,\" she recalled. \"[I had seen] U2 [who] gave me lashes of love and inspiration, and a few nights later the Virgin Prunes fucked\u2013me\u2013up.\"[297] Decades later, in 2009, Love introduced the band's frontman Gavin Friday at a Carnegie Hall event, and performed a song with him.[297] Love's diverse genre interests were illustrated in a 1991 interview with Flipside, in which she stated: \"There's a part of me that wants to have a grindcore band and another that wants to have a Raspberries-type pop band.\"[84] Discussing the abrasive sound of Hole's debut album, she said she felt she had to \"catch up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths.\"[292] She has also embraced the influence of experimental artists and punk rock groups, including Sonic Youth, Swans,[298] Big Black, Diamanda Gal\u00e1s,[299] the Germs, and The Stooges.[300] While writing Celebrity Skin, she drew influence from Neil Young and My Bloody Valentine.[174] She has also cited her contemporary PJ Harvey as an influence, saying: \"The one rock star that makes me know I'm shit is Polly Harvey. I'm nothing next to the purity that she experiences.\"[301] In 2014, she named \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" by The Verve as one of her favorite songs.[291] Literature and poetry have often been a major influence on her songwriting; Love said she had \"always wanted to be a poet, but there was no money in it.\"[302] She has named the works of T.S. Eliot and Charles Baudelaire as influential,[35][303] and referenced works by Dante Rossetti,[304] William Shakespeare,[305] Rudyard Kipling, and Anne Sexton in her lyrics.[306] Musically, Love's work with Hole and her solo efforts have been characterized as alternative rock;[307] Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock.[308] Spin's October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements.[309] In 1998, she stated that Hole had \"always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back\u00a0... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework.\"[174] Love's lyrical content is composed from a female's point of view,[310] and her lyrics have been described as \"literate and mordant\"[311] and noted by scholars for \"articulating a third-wave feminist consciousness.\"[312] Simon Reynolds, in reviewing Hole's debut album, noted: \"Ms. Love's songs explore the full spectrum of female emotions, from vulnerability to rage. The songs are fueled by adolescent traumas, feelings of disgust about the body, passionate friendships with women and the desire to escape domesticity. Her lyrical style could be described as emotional nudism.\"[310] Journalist and critic Kim France, in critiquing Love's lyrics, referred to her as a \"dark genius\" and likened her work to that of Anne Sexton.[313] Love has remarked that lyrics have always been the most important component of songwriting for her: \"The important thing for me...\u00a0 is it has to look good on the page. I mean, you can love Led Zeppelin and not love their lyrics...\u00a0 but I made a big effort in my career to have what's on the page mean something.\"[314] A great deal of her songwriting has been diaristic in nature.[315] Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with Everett True, she said: \"I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things\u00a0... I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space.\"[316] Critics have noted that Love's later musical work is more lyrically introspective.[317] Celebrity Skin and America's Sweetheart are lyrically centered on celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image. Nobody's Daughter was lyrically reflective of Love's past relationships and her struggle for sobriety, with the majority of its lyrics written while she was in rehab in 2006.[318] Love possesses a contralto vocal range.[319] According to Love, she never wanted to be a singer, but rather aspired to be a skilled guitarist: \"I'm such a lazy bastard though that I never did that,\" she said. \"I was always the only person with the nerve to sing, and so I got stuck with it.\"[35] She has been regularly noted by critics for her husky vocals as well as her \"banshee [-like]\" screaming abilities.[320][321] Her vocals have been compared to those of Johnny Rotten,[322][323] and David Fricke of Rolling Stone described them as \"lung-busting\" and \"a corrosive, lunatic wail.\"[322] Upon the release of Hole's 2010 album, Nobody's Daughter, Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork compared Love's raspy, unpolished vocals to those of Bob Dylan.[324] She has played a variety of Fender guitars throughout her career, including a Jaguar and a vintage 1965 Jazzmaster; the latter was purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe and is on display in New York City.[325] Between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a Rickenbacker 425[326] because she \"preferred the 3/4 neck,\"[184] but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins.[107] In the mid-1990s, she often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars,[185] as well as a Univox Hi-Flier.[327] Fender's Vista Venus, designed by Love in 1998, was partially inspired by Rickenbacker guitars as well as her Mercury.[185] During tours after the release of Nobody's Daughter (post-2010), Love has played a Rickenbacker 360 onstage.[328] Her setup has included Fender tube gear, Matchless, Ampeg, Silvertone and a solid-state 1976 Randall Commander.[184] Love has referred to herself as \"a shit guitar player,\" further commenting in a 2014 interview: \"I can still write a song, but [the guitar playing] sounds like shit\u00a0... I used to be a good rhythm player but I am no longer dependable.\"[329] Throughout her career, she has also garnered a reputation for unpredictable live shows.[149] In the 1990s, her performances with Hole were characterized by confrontational behavior, with Love stage diving, smashing guitars[107] or throwing them into the audience,[330] wandering into the crowd at the end of sets,[330] and engaging in sometimes incoherent rants.[150] Critics and journalists have noted Love for her comical, often stream-of-consciousness-like stage banter.[331][332] In a review of a live performance published in 2010, it was noted that Love's onstage \"one-liners [were] worthy of the Comedy Store.\"[332] In 1993, Love and husband Kurt Cobain performed an acoustic set together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Los Angeles, which raised awareness and provided resources for victims of sexual abuse.[135] In 2000, Love publicly advocated for reform of the record industry in a personal letter published by Salon.[333] In the letter, Love said: \"It's not piracy when kids swap music over the Internet using Napster or Gnutella or Freenet or iMesh or beaming their CDs into a My.MP3.com or MyPlay.com music locker. It's piracy when those guys that run those companies make side deals with the cartel lawyers and label heads so that they can be 'the label's' friend', and not the artists.\"[333] In a subsequent interview with Carrie Fisher, she said that she was interested in starting a union for recording artists,[13] and also discussed race relations in the music industry, advocating for record companies to \"put money back into the black community [whom] white people have been stealing from for years.\"[334] Love has been a long-standing supporter of LGBT causes.[335] She has frequently collaborated with Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, taking part in the center's \"An Evening with Women\" events.[336] The proceeds of the event help provide food and shelter for homeless youth; services for seniors; legal assistance; domestic violence services; health and mental health services, and cultural arts programs. Love participated with Linda Perry for the event in 2012, and performed alongside Aimee Mann and comedian Wanda Sykes. Speaking on her collaboration on the event, Love said: \"Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year go out on the street, and forty percent of those kids are gay, lesbian, or transgendered. They come out to their parents, and become homeless... for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations\u2014I've played many of them\u2014but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs.\"[337] She has also contributed to AIDS organizations, partaking in benefits for amfAR[338] and the RED Campaign.[339] In May 2011, she donated six of her husband Cobain's personal vinyl records for auction at Mariska Hargitay's Joyful Heart Foundation event for victims of child abuse, rape, and domestic violence.[340] She has also supported the Sophie Lancaster Foundation.[341] Love has had an impact on female-fronted alternative acts and performers.[343] She has been cited as influential on young female instrumentalists in particular,[344] having once infamously proclaimed: \"I want every girl in the world to pick up a guitar and start screaming...[345] I strap on that motherfucking guitar and you cannot fuck with me. That's my feeling.\"[346] In The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon, it is noted: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}[Love] truly lived up to Paul Westerberg's (The Replacements) assessment of pretty girls 'playing makeup/wearing guitar'\u00a0... She frequently stood on stage, microphone in hand and foot on monitor, and simply let her Fender guitar dangle around her neck. She truly embodied the empowerment that came with playing the electric guitar\u00a0... Love depended heavily upon her male lead guitar foil Eric Erlandson, but the rest of her band remained exclusively female throughout several lineup changes.[342] \u2013Love on having a cultural impact, 1997[347] With over 3 million records sold in the United States alone,[d] Hole became one of the most successful rock bands of all time fronted by a woman.[344][349] VH1 ranked Love no. 69 in their list of The 100 Greatest Women in Music History in 2012.[350] In 2015, the Phoenix New Times declared Love the number one greatest female rock star of all time, writing: \"To build a perfect rock star, there are several crucial ingredients: musical talent, physical attractiveness, tumultuous relationships, substance abuse, and public meltdowns, just to name a few. These days, Love seems to have rebounded from her epic tailspin and has leveled out in a slightly more normal manner, but there's no doubt that her life to date is the type of story people wouldn't believe in a novel or a movie.\"[351] Among the alternative musicians who have cited Love as an influence are Scout Niblett;[352] Brody Dalle of The Distillers;[353] Dee Dee Penny of Dum Dum Girls;[354] and Nine Black Alps.[355] Contemporary female pop artists Lana Del Rey,[356] Avril Lavigne,[357] Tove Lo,[358] and Sky Ferreira[359] have also cited Love as an influence. Love has frequently been recognized as the most high-profile contributor of feminist music during the 1990s,[360] and for \"subverting [the] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound.\"[361] According to music journalist Maria Raha, \"Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism.\"[362] Patti Smith, a major influence of Love's, also praised her, saying: \"I hate genderizing things\u00a0... [but] when I heard Hole, I was amazed to hear a girl sing like that. Janis Joplin was her own thing; she was into Big Mama Thornton and Bessie Smith. But what Courtney Love does, I'd never heard a girl do that.\"[363] She has also been a gay icon since the mid-1990s,[364] and has jokingly referred to her fanbase as consisting of \"females, gay guys, and a few advanced, evolved heterosexual men.\"[330] Love's aesthetic image, particularly in the early 1990s, also became influential, and was dubbed \"kinderwhore\" by critics and media. The subversive fashion mainly consisted of vintage babydoll dresses accompanied by smeared makeup and red lipstick.[94][365] MTV reporter Kurt Loder described Love as looking like \"a debauched rag doll\" onstage.[366][367] Love later said she had been influenced by the fashion of Chrissy Amphlett of the Divinyls.[368] Interviewed in 1994, Love commented \"I would like to think\u2013in my heart of hearts\u2013that I'm changing some psychosexual aspects of rock music. Not that I'm so desirable. I didn't do the kinder-whore thing because I thought I was so hot. When I see the look used to make one more appealing, it pisses me off. When I started, it was a What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? thing. My angle was irony.\" [369] Hole discography Solo discography Filmography Bibliography",

A figure in the punk and grunge scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the lead vocalist of the alternative rock band Hole, which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. In 2020, NME named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"[1]\nBorn to countercultural parents in San Francisco, Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in Portland, Oregon, where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in Dublin and Liverpool before returning to the United States and was cast in the Alex Cox films Sid and Nancy (1986) and Straight to Hell (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's 1991 debut album, produced by Kim Gordon. Hole's second release, Live Through This (1994), was met with critical accolades and multi-platinum sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance as Althea Leasure in Milo\u0161 Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), was nominated for three Grammy Awards.\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as Man on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, which resulted in a mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire.\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a manga, Princess Ai, between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love (2006).\nCourtney Michelle Harrison[a] was born on July 9, 1964, at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, California,[3] the first child of psychotherapist Linda Carroll (n\u00e9e Risi) and Hank Harrison, a publisher and road manager for the Grateful Dead.[4][5] Love's godfather is the founding Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh.[6][7] Her mother, who was adopted at birth and raised by a prominent Italian-Catholic family in San Francisco,[8] was later revealed to be the biological daughter of novelist Paula Fox;[9][10] Love's maternal great-grandmother was screenwriter Elsie Fox.[11] According to Love, she was named after Courtney Farrell, the protagonist of Pamela Moore's 1956 novel Chocolates for Breakfast.[12] She is of Cuban, English, German, Irish, and Welsh descent.[13]\n\u2013Love on her childhood[14]\nLove spent her early years in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco until her parents' 1969 divorce, spurred by her mother's allegations that her father had fed Courtney LSD when she was a toddler.[15][16] Though he denied the claim, full custody of Love was awarded to her mother.[17] In 1970, Carroll relocated with Love to the rural community of Marcola, Oregon where they lived along the Mohawk River[18] while she completed her psychology degree at the University of Oregon.[19] There, Love was adopted by her then-stepfather, Frank Rodriguez.[18] He and her mother had two daughters and a son who died in infancy of a heart defect when Love was ten; they also adopted a boy.[20] Love attended a Montessori school in Eugene, where she struggled academically and had trouble making friends.[21][22] At age nine, a psychologist noted that she exhibited signs of autism.[14][21][23]\nIn 1972, Love's mother divorced Rodriguez, remarried, and moved the family to Nelson, New Zealand.[24] There, she enrolled Love at Nelson College for Girls,[25] from which she was soon expelled.[26] In 1973, she was sent back to live in the United States, where she was raised in Portland, Oregon[27] by her former stepfather and other family friends.[28][29] During this time, her mother gave birth to two of Love's other half-brothers.[18] At age fourteen, she was arrested for shoplifting a T-shirt from a Woolworth's,[30] and was sent to Hillcrest Correctional Facility, a juvenile hall in Salem, Oregon.[22][31] She was subsequently placed in foster care until she became legally emancipated at age 16.[16] She supported herself by working illegally as a topless dancer[32] at Mary's Club in downtown Portland[33] adopting the last name \"Love\" to conceal her identity; she later adopted \"Love\" as her surname.[18] She also worked various odd jobs, including picking berries at a farm in Troutdale, Oregon,[34][35] and as a disc jockey at a gay disco.[36] During this time, she enrolled at Portland State University, studying English and philosophy.[37][38] Love has said that she \"didn't have a lot of social skills,\"[39] and that she learned them while frequenting gay clubs and spending time with drag queens.[40]\nIn 1981, she was granted a small trust fund that had been left by her adoptive grandparents, which she used to travel to Dublin, Ireland, where her biological father was living.[41] While there, she enrolled in courses at Trinity College, studying theology for two semesters.[42][43] She would later receive honorary patronage from Trinity's University Philosophical Society in 2010.[44] After leaving Trinity, Love relocated to Liverpool, where she became acquainted with musician Julian Cope and his band, The Teardrop Explodes, and briefly lived in his house.[45] \"They kind of took me in\", she recalled. \"I was sort of a mascot; I would get them coffee or tea during rehearsal.\"[46] In Cope's autobiography Head-On, Love is referred to as \"the adolescent.\"[47] After spending a year abroad, Love returned to Portland: \"I thought that [going to the United Kingdom] was my peak life experience,\" she said in 2011. \"\u2014that nothing else [would] happen to me again.\"[48] In 1983, she took short-lived jobs working as an erotic dancer in Japan and later Taiwan, but was deported after the club was shut down by the government.[49][50]\nLove began several music projects in the 1980s, first forming Sugar Babylon (later Sugar Babydoll)[b] in Portland with her friends Ursula Wehr and Robin Barbur.[52] In 1982, Love attended a Faith No More concert in San Francisco and convinced the members to let her join as a singer.[53][54] The group recorded material with Love as a vocalist, but she was subsequently kicked out of the band. According to the Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum, who remained Love's friend in the years after, the band wanted a \"male energy.\"[55]\nShe later formed the Pagan Babies with friend Kat Bjelland, whom she met at the Satyricon club in Portland in 1984.[56] As Love later reflected, \"The best thing that ever happened to me in a way, was Kat.\"[57] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they recruited bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka.[58] According to Bjelland, \"[Courtney] didn't play an instrument at the time\" aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her.[22] The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985.[58][59] After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.[22] Drummer Lori Barbero and bassist Maureen Herman recalled Courtney's departure 'She lived in my house for a little while. And then we did a concert at the Orpheum. It was in 1988. It was called O-88 with Butthole Surfers, Cows &amp; Bastards, Run Westy Run, and Babes in Toyland. And I guess Maureen took Courtney to the airport after she stole all the money'.  'She stayed and stayed, and then the next day she wanted me to take her to the airport. And so I drove her to the airport. She had just had some weird fight with the guy at the desk, and then she left. She said, \u201cI'm going to go to L.A. and I'm going to get my face done and I'm going to be famous.' - 'And then she did' [60]\nDeciding to shift her focus to acting, Love enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute[61] and studied film under experimental director George Kuchar.[62][63] Love was featured in one of his short films, titled Club Vatican.[64][65][66] In 1985 she submitted an audition tape for the role of Nancy Spungen in the Sid Vicious biopic Sid and Nancy (1986), and was given a minor supporting role by director Alex Cox.[67][68] After filming Sid and Nancy in New York City, she worked at a peep show in Times Square and squatted at the ABC No Rio social center and Pyramid Club in the East Village.[69][70] The same year, Cox cast her in a leading role in his film Straight to Hell (1987),[71] a spaghetti western starring Joe Strummer and Grace Jones filmed in Spain in 1986.[72] The film caught the attention of Andy Warhol, who featured Love in an episode of Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes.[73] She also had a part in the 1988 Ramones music video for \"I Wanna Be Sedated,\" appearing as a bride among dozens of party guests.[74][75][76]\nIn 1988, Love aborted her acting career and left New York, returning to the West Coast, citing the \"celebutante\" fame she'd attained as the central reason.[77] She returned to stripping in the small town of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar.[78] This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to \"gather her thoughts,\" supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen.[79] \"I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work\", she said in retrospect. \"So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers.\"[80]\n\u2013Don Fleming, who co-produced Hole's debut album with Kim Gordon, on Love[81]\nAt the end of 1988, Love taught herself to play guitar and relocated to Los Angeles,[82] where she placed an ad in a local music zine: \"I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, and Fleetwood Mac.\"[83] Love recruited lead guitarist Eric Erlandson; Lisa Roberts, her neighbor, as bassist; and drummer Caroline Rue, whom she met at a Gwar concert.[84] Love named the band Hole after a line from Euripides' Medea[85] (\"There is a hole that pierces right through me\")[86] as well as a conversation she had had with her mother, in which she told her that she couldn't live her life \"with a hole running through her.\"[87] Love's marriage to James Moreland (vocalist of The Leaving Trains) was brief, ending in an annulment.[88] After forming Hole, she and bandmate Eric Erlandson had a romantic relationship that lasted over a year.[89]\nIn the band's formative stages, Love continued to work at strip clubs in Hollywood (including Jumbo's Clown Room and the Seventh Veil),[83]saving money to purchase backline equipment and a touring van,[90] while rehearsing at a studio in Hollywood that was loaned to her by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.[91] Hole played their first show in November 1989 at Raji's, a rock club in central Hollywood.[92] The band's debut single, \"Retard Girl\", was issued in April 1990 through the Long Beach indie label Sympathy for the Record Industry, and was given airtime by Rodney Bingenheimer's show on local rock station KROQ.[22] That fall, the band appeared on the cover of Flipside, a Los Angeles-based punk fanzine.[84] In early 1991, the band released their second single, \"Dicknail\", through Sub Pop Records.[93]\nWith no wave, noise rock and grindcore bands being major influences on Love,[84] Hole's first studio album, Pretty on the Inside, captured a particularly abrasive sound and contained disturbing, graphic lyrics,[94][95] described by Q magazine as \"confrontational [and] genuinely uninhibited.\"[96] The record was released in September 1991 on Caroline Records, produced by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth with assistant production from Gumball's Don Fleming; Love and Gordon had initially met when Hole opened for Sonic Youth during their promotional tour for Goo at the Whisky a Go Go in November 1990.[97] In early 1991, Love sent Gordon a personal letter asking her to produce the record for the band, to which she agreed.[95][98]\nThough Love would later say Pretty on the Inside was \"unlistenable\" and \"[un]melodic,\"[99] the album received generally positive critical reception from indie and punk rock critics[100] and was labeled one of the twenty best albums of the year by Spin magazine.[101] It also gained a following in the United Kingdom, charting at 59 on the UK Albums Chart,[102] and its lead single, \"Teenage Whore\", entered the country's indie chart at number one.[103] The underlying feminist slant of some of the album's songs led many to mistakenly tag the band as being part of the riot grrrl movement,[104] a movement with which Love did not associate.[105][106] The band toured in support of the record, headlining with Mudhoney in Europe; in the United States, they opened for the Smashing Pumpkins,[107] and performed at CBGB in New York City.[108]\nDuring this tour, Love briefly dated Billy Corgan of the rock band the Smashing Pumpkins[109] before formally dating Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain.[110] It is uncertain when they first met, and there are varying accounts of how they came to know one another.[c] Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum.[112] According to Love, she first met him at a Dharma Bums show in Portland,[113][114] while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain in a parking lot after a Butthole Surfers/L7 concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991.[89] Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became re-acquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.[115][116] and were officially a couple by the close of 1991.[117][118]\n\u2013Love on her public image after marrying Kurt Cobain[119]\nShortly after completing the tour for Pretty on the Inside, Love married Cobain on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 24, 1992.[120] She wore a satin and lace dress once owned by actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore plaid pajamas.[121] During Love's pregnancy, Hole recorded a cover of \"Over the Edge\" for a Wipers tribute album,[122] and recorded their fourth single, \"Beautiful Son\", which was released in April 1993. On August 18 of that year, the couple's only child, a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born in Los Angeles.[120] The couple subsequently relocated to Carnation, Washington and then to Seattle.[123][124]\nLove's first major media exposure came in a September 1992 profile of herself and Cobain for Vanity Fair by journalist Lynn Hirschberg, entitled \"Strange Love.\"[125] After being asked to participate in a cover story for the magazine, Love was urged by her manager to accept the request.[126] In the year prior, Love and Cobain had developed a heroin addiction, and the profile painted the couple in an unflattering light and suggested that Love had been addicted to heroin during her pregnancy.[127] The article ultimately resulted in the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigating, and custody of Love and Cobain's newborn daughter, Frances, was temporarily awarded to Love's sister, Jaimee.[128] Love claimed she was misquoted by Hirschberg, and asserted that she had immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant.[126][129][130] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state,[131][132][133] suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.[126][134]\nOn September 8, 1993, Love and Cobain made their only public performance together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Hollywood, performing two acoustic duets of \"Pennyroyal Tea\" and \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night.\"[135] Love also performed electric versions of two new Hole songs, \"Doll Parts\" and \"Miss World,\" both written for the band's upcoming second album.[135] In October 1993, Hole recorded their second album, Live Through This, in Atlanta. The album featured a new lineup with bassist Kristen Pfaff and drummer Patty Schemel. Live Through This was released on Geffen's subsidiary label DGC in April 1994, four days after Cobain died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in their Seattle home while Love was in rehab in Los Angeles.[136] In the following months, Love was rarely seen in public, holing up in her Seattle home with friends and family members. After the cremation of Cobain's remains, Love divided portions of his ashes, keeping some in a teddy bear and some in an urn.[137] In June 1994, she traveled to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York, where she had his ashes ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks, and a portion were mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures.[137] On June 16, 1994, Hole's bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose in Seattle.[138] For the band's impending tour, Love recruited Canadian bassist Melissa Auf der Maur.[139]\nLive Through This was a commercial and critical success,[140][141][142] hitting platinum RIAA certification in April 1995 and receiving numerous critical accolades.[75] The success of the record combined with Cobain's suicide resulted in a high level of publicity for Love, and she was featured on Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People in 1995.[143] Simultaneously, her erratic onstage behavior and various legal troubles during Hole's 1994\u20131995 world tour compounded the media coverage of her.[144]\nHole's performance on August 26, 1994 at the Reading Festival\u2014 Love's first public performance following Cobain's death[145][146]\u2014was described by MTV as \"by turns macabre, frightening and inspirational.\"[147] John Peel wrote in The Guardian that Love's disheveled appearance \"would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam\", and that her performance \"verged on the heroic\u00a0... Love steered her band through a set which dared you to pity either her recent history or that of the band\u00a0... the band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage.\"[148] The band performed a series of riotous concerts over the following year, with Love frequently appearing hysterical onstage, flashing crowds, stage diving, and getting into fights with audience members.[145][149] One journalist reported that at the band's show in Boston in December 1994, \"Love interrupted the music and talked about her deceased husband Kurt Cobain, and also broke out into Tourette syndrome-like rants. The music was great, but the raving was vulgar and offensive, and prompted some of the audience to shout back at her.\"[150]\nThe tour was also marked by a series of legal troubles for Love: In January 1995, she was arrested in Melbourne for disrupting a Qantas Airways flight after getting into an argument with a stewardess.[151] On July 4, 1995, at the Lollapalooza Festival in George, Washington, Love threw a lit cigarette at musician Kathleen Hanna before punching her in the face, alleging that Hanna had made a joke about her daughter.[152] She pleaded guilty to an assault charge and was sentenced to anger management classes.[153][154] In November 1995, two male teenagers attempted to sue Love for allegedly punching them during a Hole concert they attended in Orlando, Florida in March 1995. The judge ultimately dismissed the case on grounds that the teens \"weren't exposed to any greater amount of violence than could reasonably be expected at an alternative rock concert.\"[155] Love would later say that she retained little memory of 1994\u20131995,[91] blaming the fact that she had been using large quantities of heroin and Rohypnol at the time.[91][156]\n\u2013Love on her role in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)[157]\nAfter Hole's world tour concluded in 1996, Love made a return to acting, first in small roles in the Jean-Michel Basquiat biopic Basquiat and the drama Feeling Minnesota (1996),[158] before landing the co-starring role of Larry Flynt's wife Althea in Milo\u0161 Forman's critically acclaimed 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt. In order to appear in the film, Love went through rehabilitation and quit using heroin at the insistence of Forman; she was ordered to take multiple urine tests under the supervision of Columbia Pictures while filming the movie, and passed all of them.[159][160] Despite Columbia Pictures' initial reluctance to hire Love due to her troubled past,[159] she received critical acclaim for her performance in the film after its release in December 1996, earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress,[161] and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress.[162] Critic Roger Ebert called her work in the film \"quite a performance; Love proves she is not a rock star pretending to act, but a true actress.\"[163] She won several other awards from various film critic associations for the film.[164][165] During this time, Love maintained what the media noted as a more decorous public image,[166] and she appeared in ad campaigns for Versace[167][168][169] and in a Vogue Italia spread.[170] Following the release of The People vs. Larry Flynt, she dated her co-star Edward Norton, with whom she remained until 1999.[171][172]\nIn late 1997, Hole released a compilation album and extended play, both of which featured previously-recorded material. Love subsequently attracted media attention in May 1998 after punching journalist Belissa Cohen in the face at a party; the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.[173] In September 1998, Hole released their third studio album, Celebrity Skin, which featured a stark power pop sound that contrasted with the group's earlier punk influences.[174] Love divulged her ambition of making an album where \"art meets commerce\u00a0... there are no compromises made, it has commercial appeal, and it sticks to [our] original vision.\"[174] She said she was influenced by Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, and My Bloody Valentine when writing the album.[174][175] Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan co-wrote several songs on the album. Celebrity Skin was well received by critics; Rolling Stone called it \"accessible, fiery and intimate\u2014often at the same time\u00a0... a basic guitar record that's anything but basic\".[176] Celebrity Skin went multi-platinum, and topped \"Best of Year\" lists at Spin and The Village Voice.[75] The album garnered the band their only No.\u00a01 hit single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart with the title track \"Celebrity Skin\".[177] The band promoted the album through MTV performances and at the 1998 Billboard Music Awards,[178] and were subsequently nominated for three Grammy Awards at the 41st Grammy Awards ceremony.[179]\nHole toured with Marilyn Manson on the Beautiful Monsters Tour in 1999, but dropped out of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over production costs between Love and Manson, in addition to the fact that Hole was forced to open for Manson under an agreement with Interscope Records.[180] Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen.[181][182] Love would later make claims that an additional reason the band left the tour was due to Manson and Korn's (whom they also toured with in Australia) sexualized treatment of teenage female audience members.[183] Love told interviewers at 99X.FM in Atlanta: \"What I really don't like\u2014there are certain girls that like us, or like me, who are really messed up... and they do not need to be\u2014they're very young\u2014and they do not need to be taken and raped, or filmed having enema contests... going out into the audience and picking up fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls who obviously cut themselves, and then having to see them in the morning... it's just uncool.\"[180]\nBefore the release and promotion of Celebrity Skin, Love and Fender designed a low-priced Squier brand guitar, called Vista Venus.[184] The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, a little-known independent guitar manufacturer,[185] Stratocaster, and Rickenbacker's solid body guitars and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions.[185] In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: \"I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty\u00a0... And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted it real simple, with just one pickup switch.\"[184] In 1999, Love was awarded an Orville H. Gibson award for Best Female Rock Guitarist.[186] During this time, she also starred opposite Jim Carrey as his longtime partner Lynne Margulies in the Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon (1999), which was followed with a role as William S. Burroughs's wife Joan Vollmer in Beat (2000) alongside Kiefer Sutherland.[187] Love was cast as the lead in John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film Ghosts of Mars, but backed out of the role after injuring her foot.[188] She subsequently sued the ex-wife of her then-boyfriend, James Barber, whom Love alleged ran over her foot with her Volvo in a parking lot, causing the injury.[189] The following year, she returned to film opposite Lili Taylor in Julie Johnson (2001), a drama in which she played a woman who has a lesbian relationship; Love won an Outstanding Actress award at L.A.'s Outfest.[190] She was then cast in the thriller Trapped (2002), alongside Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron.[191] The film was a box office flop, earning $13 million against a $30 million budget.[192]\nIn the interim, Hole had become dormant,[179][193] and in March 2001, Love began a \"punk rock femme supergroup\" called Bastard, enlisting Schemel, Veruca Salt co-frontwoman Louise Post, and bassist Gina Crosley.[194] Post recalled of the group: \"[Love] was like, 'Listen, you guys: I've been in my Malibu, manicure, movie star world for two years, alright? I wanna make a record. And let's leave all that grunge shit behind us, eh? We were being so improvisational, and singing together, and with a trust developing between us. It was the shit.\"[195] The group recorded a demo tape, but by September 2001, Post and Crosley had left the band, with Post citing \"unhealthy and unprofessional working conditions.\"[196][197] In May 2002, Hole formally announced their breakup amid continuing litigation with Universal Music Group over their record contract.[198]\nAfter the breakup of Hole, Love began composing material with songwriter Linda Perry, and in July 2003 signed a contract with Virgin Records.[199] She began recording her new album, titled America's Sweetheart, in France shortly after.[200] A total of 32 songs were recorded during these sessions.[199] A series of legal issues simultaneously occurred during this period: In February 2003, Love had been banned from Virgin Airlines after being arrested at Heathrow Airport for disrupting a flight.[201] In October of that year, she was arrested in Los Angeles after breaking several windows of her producer and then-boyfriend James Barber's home, and was charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance;[202] the ordeal resulted in her temporarily losing custody of her daughter.[203]\nVirgin Records released America's Sweetheart in February 2004, upon which it received mixed reviews.[204] Charles Aaron of Spin called it a \"jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This\" and awarded it eight out of ten stars,[205] while Amy Phillips of The Village Voice wrote: \"[Love is] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever wanted to have a glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?\"[206] The album sold less than 100,000 copies.[75] Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record,[207] reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame.[208] Shortly after the record was released, she told Kurt Loder on TRL: \"I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke.\"[209]\nOn March 17, 2004, Love appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote the recently released America's Sweetheart.[210] Her appearance drew media coverage when, during the interview segment, she lifted her shirt multiple times,[211] flashed Letterman, and stood on his desk.[210] A New York Times article noted: \"The episode was not altogether surprising for Ms. Love, 39, whose most public moments have veered from extreme pathos\u2014like the time she read the suicide note of her famous husband, Kurt Cobain, on MTV\u2014to angry feminism to catfights to incoherent ranting.\"[212] Hours later, in the early morning of March 18, Love was arrested in Manhattan for allegedly striking a 23-year-old male fan with a microphone stand during a small concert she performed at an East Village venue.[212] She was released within hours of the incident, enabling her to perform a concert scheduled for the following evening at the Bowery Ballroom.[212] Four days later, on March 22, she called in multiple times to The Howard Stern Show, claiming in broadcast conversations with Stern that the incident had not occurred, and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest.[213][214]\nOn July 9, 2004, Love's 40th birthday, she was arrested for failing to make a court appearance for the March 2004 charges, and taken to Bellevue Hospital, allegedly incoherent, where she was placed on a 72-hour watch.[215] According to police, she was believed to be a potential \"danger to herself,\" but was deemed mentally sound and released to a rehab facility two days later.[216][217] Amidst public criticism and press coverage, comedian Margaret Cho published an opinion piece on her official website in defense of Love, titled \"Courtney [Love] Deserves Better from Feminists,\" arguing that negative associations of Love with her drug and personal problems (including from feminists) overshadowed discussion of her music and, more importantly, her personal well-being.[218] Love would ultimately plead guilty in October 2004 to disorderly conduct over the alleged striking of the audience member.[219]\nHer appearance as a roaster on the Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson in August 2005 attracted Love further media attention due to her appearing visibly intoxicated and disheveled.[220] One review of the program noted that Love \"acted as if she belonged in a [psychiatric] institution.\"[220] Six days after the show's airing, she was sentenced to a 28-day lockdown rehab program for allegedly being under the influence of a controlled substance, violating her probation.[221] To avoid jail time, she accepted an additional 180-day rehab sentence in September 2005.[222] In November 2005, after successfully completing the program, Love was discharged from the rehab center under the provision that she complete further outpatient rehab.[223] In subsequent interviews in the following years, she would admit to having been dealing with various addictions during this time to prescription drugs, cocaine, and crack cocaine.[224][225] She has stated she has been sober since completing rehabilitation in 2007, and cited her Nichiren Buddhist practice (which she began in 1989)[226][227] as integral to her sobriety.[228][229]\nIn the midst of her legal troubles, Love had endeavors in writing and publishing: She collaborated on a semi-autobiographical manga titled Princess Ai (Japanese: \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u00b7\u30a2\u30a4\u7269\u8a9e), which she co-wrote with Stu Levy. The manga was illustrated by Misaho Kujiradou and Ai Yazawa, and was released in three volumes in both the United States and Japan between 2004 and 2006.[230][231] Also in 2006, she published a memoir, Dirty Blonde, and began recording what would become her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean,[232] collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled \"Loser Dust\", during her time in rehab in 2005.[233] She told Billboard: \"My hand-eye coordination was so bad [after the drug use], I didn't even know chords anymore. It was like my fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise [in rehab]\u00a0... I never thought I would work again.\"[234] Tracks and demos for the album (planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled The Return of Courtney Love, detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network More4 in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of \"Never Go Hungry Again\", recorded during an interview for The Times in November, was also released. Incomplete audio clips of the song \"Samantha\", originating from an interview with NPR, were distributed on the internet in 2007.[235]\nIn March 2009, fashion designer Dawn Simorangkir brought a libel suit against Love concerning a defamatory post Love made on her Twitter account,[236] which was eventually settled for $450,000.[237] Several months later, in June 2009, NME published an article detailing Love's plan to reunite Hole and release a new album, Nobody's Daughter.[238] In response, former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson stated in Spin magazine that contractually no reunion could take place without his involvement; therefore Nobody's Daughter would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a \"Hole\" record.[239] Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a Twitter post, claiming \"he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark\".[240] Nobody's Daughter was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist Micko Larkin, Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). Nobody's Daughter featured material written and recorded for Love's unfinished solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, including \"Pacific Coast Highway\", \"Letter to God\", \"Samantha\", and \"Never Go Hungry\", although they were re-produced in the studio with Larkin and engineer Michael Beinhorn.[241] The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk rock sound, and more acoustic guitar work than previous Hole albums.[242]\nThe first single from Nobody's Daughter was \"Skinny Little Bitch\", released to promote the album in March 2010.[243] The album received mixed reviews.[244] Robert Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five, saying Love \"worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, America's Sweetheart\".[245] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also gave the album three out of five: \"It's Marianne Faithfull's substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like 'Honey' and 'For Once in Your Life'. The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date\u00a0... the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim.\"[246] Love and the band toured internationally from 2010 into late 2012 promoting the record, with their pre-release shows in London and at South by Southwest receiving critical acclaim.[207] In 2011, Love participated in Hit So Hard, a documentary chronicling bandmate Schemel's time in Hole.[99]\nIn May 2012, Love debuted an art collection at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York titled \"And She's Not Even Pretty\",[247] which contained over forty drawings and paintings by Love composed in ink, colored pencil, pastels, and watercolors.[248][249] Later in the year, she collaborated with Michael Stipe on the track \"Rio Grande\" for Johnny Depp's sea shanty album Son of Rogues Gallery,[250] and in 2013, co-wrote and contributed vocals on \"Rat A Tat\" from Fall Out Boy's album Save Rock and Roll, also appearing in the song's music video.[251]\nAfter dropping the Hole name and performing as a solo artist[252] in late 2012,[253] Love appeared in spring 2013 advertisements for Yves Saint Laurent alongside Kim Gordon and Ariel Pink.[254] Love completed a solo tour of North America in mid-2013,[255][256] which was purported to be in promotion of an upcoming solo album; however, it was ultimately dubbed a \"greatest hits\" tour, and featured songs from Love's and Hole's back catalogue.[257] Love told Billboard at the time that she had recorded eight songs in the studio.[258]\nLove was subject of a second landmark libel lawsuit brought against her in January 2014 by her former attorney Rhonda Holmes, who accused Love of online defamation, seeking $8 million in damages.[259] It was the first case of alleged Twitter-based libel in U.S. history to make it to trial.[260] The jury, however, found in Love's favor.[259] A subsequent defamation lawsuit filed by fashion Simorangkir in February 2014, however, resulted in Love being ordered to pay a further $350,000 in recompense.[237]\nOn April 22, 2014, Love debuted the song \"You Know My Name\" on BBC Radio 6 to promote her tour of the United Kingdom.[261] It was released as a double A-side single with the song \"Wedding Day\" on May 4, 2014, on her own label Cherry Forever Records via Kobalt Label Services.[262] The tracks were produced by Michael Beinhorn, and feature Tommy Lee on drums.[263] In an interview with the BBC, Love revealed that she and former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson had reconciled, and had been rehearsing new material together, along with former bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and drummer Patty Schemel, though she did not confirm a reunion of the band.[264] On May 1, 2014, in an interview with Pitchfork, Love commented further on the possibility of Hole reuniting, saying:\n\"I'm not going to commit to it happening, because we want an element of surprise. There's a lot of is to be dotted and ts to be crossed.\"[265][266]\nLove was cast in several television series in supporting parts throughout 2014 including the FX series Sons of Anarchy,[267] Revenge,[268] and Lee Daniels' network series Empire in a recurring guest role as Elle Dallas.[269] The track \"Walk Out on Me\" featuring Love was included on the Empire: Original Soundtrack from Season 1 album, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200.[270] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the track, saying: \"The idea of Courtney Love singing a ballad with a group of gospel singers seems faintly terrifying\u00a0... the reality is brilliant. Love's voice fits the careworn lyrics, effortlessly summoning the kind of ravaged darkness that Lana Del Rey nearly ruptures herself trying to conjure up.\"[271]\nIn January 2015, Love starred in a New York City stage production titled Kansas City Choir Boy, a \"pop opera\" conceived by and co-starring Todd Almond.[272] Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised her performance, noting a \"soft-edged and bewitching\" stage presence, adding: \"Her voice, never the most supple or rangy of instruments, retains the singular sound that made her an electrifying front woman for the band Hole: a single sustained noted can seem to simultaneously contain a plea, a wound and a threat.\"[273] The show toured later in the year, with performances in Boston and Los Angeles.[274] Love saw further legal troubles in April 2015 when journalist Anthony Bozza sued her over an alleged contractual violation regarding his co-writing of her memoir.[275] Love subsequently joined Lana Del Rey on her Endless Summer Tour, performing as an opener on the tour's eight West Coast shows in May\u2013June 2015.[276] During her tenure on Del Rey's tour, Love debuted a new single, \"Miss Narcissist\", released on Wavves' independent label Ghost Ramp.[277] She also was cast in a supporting role in James Franco's film The Long Home, based on William Gay's novel of the same name, marking her first film role in over ten years.[278]\nIn January 2016, Love released a clothing line in collaboration with Sophia Amoruso titled \"Love, Courtney\", featuring eighteen pieces reflecting her personal style.[279] In November 2016, she began filming the pilot for A Midsummer's Nightmare, a Shakespeare anthology series adapted for Lifetime.[280] She then starred as Kitty Menendez in Menendez: Blood Brothers, a biopic television film based on the lives of Lyle and Erik Menendez, which premiered on Lifetime in June 2017.[281] The same year, she was cast in Justin Kelly's biopic JT LeRoy, opposite Laura Dern, Kristen Stewart, Diane Kruger, and Kelvin Harrison Jr..[282] In March 2018, Love appeared in the music video for Marilyn Manson's \"Tattooed in Reverse,\"[283] which she followed with an April 5 guest-judge appearance on RuPaul's Drag Race.[284]\nIn December 2018, Love filed and was awarded a restraining order against Sam Lutfi, who had acted as her manager for the previous six years, alleging verbal abuse and harassment.[285] Her daughter, Frances, and sister, Jaimee, were also awarded restraining orders against Lutfi.[285] In January 2019, a Los Angeles County judge extended the three-year duration of the order to a total of five years, citing Lutfi's apparent tendency to \"prey upon people.\"[286]\nOn August 18, 2019, Love performed a solo set at the Yola D\u00eda festival in Los Angeles, which also featured performances by Cat Power and Lykke Li.[287] On September 9, Love garnered press attention when she publicly criticized Joss Sackler, an heiress to the Sackler family OxyContin fortune, after she allegedly offered Love $100,000 to attend her fashion show during New York Fashion Week.[288] In the same statement, Love indicated  that she had relapsed into opioid addiction in 2018, stating that she had recently celebrated a year of sobriety.[288]\nOn November 21, a new track, \"Mother,\" was released on the internet, as part of the soundtrack for the upcoming horror film The Turning (2020).[289] Love co-wrote the track with Lawrence Rothman, who also served as producer.[289] In January 2020, NME named Love as a recipient of the Icon Award, deeming her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"[1]\nLove has been candid about her diverse musical influences, the earliest being Patti Smith, The Runaways, and The Pretenders, artists she discovered while in juvenile hall at age fifteen.[290] As a child, her first exposure to music was records that her parents retrieved each month through Columbia Record Club.[291] The first record Love owned was Leonard Cohen's Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967), which she obtained from her mother: \"He was so lyric-conscious and morbid, and I was a pretty morbid kid,\" she recalled.[291] As a teenager, she named Flipper, Kate Bush, Soft Cell, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro,[292] Lou Reed, and Dead Kennedys among her favorite artists.[45] She has also spoken of her appreciation for new wave and post-punk bands she became acquainted with while living as a teenager in the United Kingdom, such as Echo and the Bunnymen,[293] The Smiths,[294] Siouxsie and the Banshees,[295] Television,[295] Bauhaus,[294] and Joy Division.[296]\nWhile in Dublin at age fifteen, Love attended a Virgin Prunes concert, an event she credited as being a pivotal influence: \"I had never seen so much sex, snarl, poetry, evil, restraint, grace, filth, raw power and the very essence of rock and roll,\" she recalled. \"[I had seen] U2 [who] gave me lashes of love and inspiration, and a few nights later the Virgin Prunes fucked\u2013me\u2013up.\"[297] Decades later, in 2009, Love introduced the band's frontman Gavin Friday at a Carnegie Hall event, and performed a song with him.[297]\nLove's diverse genre interests were illustrated in a 1991 interview with Flipside, in which she stated: \"There's a part of me that wants to have a grindcore band and another that wants to have a Raspberries-type pop band.\"[84] Discussing the abrasive sound of Hole's debut album, she said she felt she had to \"catch up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths.\"[292] She has also embraced the influence of experimental artists and punk rock groups, including Sonic Youth, Swans,[298] Big Black, Diamanda Gal\u00e1s,[299] the Germs, and The Stooges.[300] While writing Celebrity Skin, she drew influence from Neil Young and My Bloody Valentine.[174] She has also cited her contemporary PJ Harvey as an influence, saying: \"The one rock star that makes me know I'm shit is Polly Harvey. I'm nothing next to the purity that she experiences.\"[301] In 2014, she named \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" by The Verve as one of her favorite songs.[291]\nLiterature and poetry have often been a major influence on her songwriting; Love said she had \"always wanted to be a poet, but there was no money in it.\"[302] She has named the works of T.S. Eliot and Charles Baudelaire as influential,[35][303] and referenced works by Dante Rossetti,[304] William Shakespeare,[305] Rudyard Kipling, and Anne Sexton in her lyrics.[306]\nMusically, Love's work with Hole and her solo efforts have been characterized as alternative rock;[307] Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock.[308] Spin's October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements.[309] In 1998, she stated that Hole had \"always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back\u00a0... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework.\"[174]\nLove's lyrical content is composed from a female's point of view,[310] and her lyrics have been described as \"literate and mordant\"[311] and noted by scholars for \"articulating a third-wave feminist consciousness.\"[312] Simon Reynolds, in reviewing Hole's debut album, noted: \"Ms. Love's songs explore the full spectrum of female emotions, from vulnerability to rage. The songs are fueled by adolescent traumas, feelings of disgust about the body, passionate friendships with women and the desire to escape domesticity. Her lyrical style could be described as emotional nudism.\"[310] Journalist and critic Kim France, in critiquing Love's lyrics, referred to her as a \"dark genius\" and likened her work to that of Anne Sexton.[313]\nLove has remarked that lyrics have always been the most important component of songwriting for her: \"The important thing for me...\u00a0 is it has to look good on the page. I mean, you can love Led Zeppelin and not love their lyrics...\u00a0 but I made a big effort in my career to have what's on the page mean something.\"[314] A great deal of her songwriting has been diaristic in nature.[315] Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with Everett True, she said: \"I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things\u00a0... I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space.\"[316]\nCritics have noted that Love's later musical work is more lyrically introspective.[317] Celebrity Skin and America's Sweetheart are lyrically centered on celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image. Nobody's Daughter was lyrically reflective of Love's past relationships and her struggle for sobriety, with the majority of its lyrics written while she was in rehab in 2006.[318]\nLove possesses a contralto vocal range.[319] According to Love, she never wanted to be a singer, but rather aspired to be a skilled guitarist: \"I'm such a lazy bastard though that I never did that,\" she said. \"I was always the only person with the nerve to sing, and so I got stuck with it.\"[35] She has been regularly noted by critics for her husky vocals as well as her \"banshee [-like]\" screaming abilities.[320][321] Her vocals have been compared to those of Johnny Rotten,[322][323] and David Fricke of Rolling Stone described them as \"lung-busting\" and \"a corrosive, lunatic wail.\"[322] Upon the release of Hole's 2010 album, Nobody's Daughter, Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork compared Love's raspy, unpolished vocals to those of Bob Dylan.[324]\nShe has played a variety of Fender guitars throughout her career, including a Jaguar and a vintage 1965 Jazzmaster; the latter was purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe and is on display in New York City.[325] Between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a Rickenbacker 425[326] because she \"preferred the 3/4 neck,\"[184] but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins.[107] In the mid-1990s, she often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars,[185] as well as a Univox Hi-Flier.[327] Fender's Vista Venus, designed by Love in 1998, was partially inspired by Rickenbacker guitars as well as her Mercury.[185] During tours after the release of Nobody's Daughter (post-2010), Love has played a Rickenbacker 360 onstage.[328] Her setup has included Fender tube gear, Matchless, Ampeg, Silvertone and a solid-state 1976 Randall Commander.[184]\nLove has referred to herself as \"a shit guitar player,\" further commenting in a 2014 interview: \"I can still write a song, but [the guitar playing] sounds like shit\u00a0... I used to be a good rhythm player but I am no longer dependable.\"[329] Throughout her career, she has also garnered a reputation for unpredictable live shows.[149] In the 1990s, her performances with Hole were characterized by confrontational behavior, with Love stage diving, smashing guitars[107] or throwing them into the audience,[330] wandering into the crowd at the end of sets,[330] and engaging in sometimes incoherent rants.[150] Critics and journalists have noted Love for her comical, often stream-of-consciousness-like stage banter.[331][332] In a review of a live performance published in 2010, it was noted that Love's onstage \"one-liners [were] worthy of the Comedy Store.\"[332]\nIn 1993, Love and husband Kurt Cobain performed an acoustic set together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Los Angeles, which raised awareness and provided resources for victims of sexual abuse.[135] In 2000, Love publicly advocated for reform of the record industry in a personal letter published by Salon.[333] In the letter, Love said: \"It's not piracy when kids swap music over the Internet using Napster or Gnutella or Freenet or iMesh or beaming their CDs into a My.MP3.com or MyPlay.com music locker. It's piracy when those guys that run those companies make side deals with the cartel lawyers and label heads so that they can be 'the label's' friend', and not the artists.\"[333] In a subsequent interview with Carrie Fisher, she said that she was interested in starting a union for recording artists,[13] and also discussed race relations in the music industry, advocating for record companies to \"put money back into the black community [whom] white people have been stealing from for years.\"[334]\nLove has been a long-standing supporter of LGBT causes.[335] She has frequently collaborated with Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, taking part in the center's \"An Evening with Women\" events.[336] The proceeds of the event help provide food and shelter for homeless youth; services for seniors; legal assistance; domestic violence services; health and mental health services, and cultural arts programs. Love participated with Linda Perry for the event in 2012, and performed alongside Aimee Mann and comedian Wanda Sykes. Speaking on her collaboration on the event, Love said: \"Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year go out on the street, and forty percent of those kids are gay, lesbian, or transgendered. They come out to their parents, and become homeless... for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations\u2014I've played many of them\u2014but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs.\"[337]\nShe has also contributed to AIDS organizations, partaking in benefits for amfAR[338] and the RED Campaign.[339] In May 2011, she donated six of her husband Cobain's personal vinyl records for auction at Mariska Hargitay's Joyful Heart Foundation event for victims of child abuse, rape, and domestic violence.[340] She has also supported the Sophie Lancaster Foundation.[341]\n\nLove has had an impact on female-fronted alternative acts and performers.[343] She has been cited as influential on young female instrumentalists in particular,[344] having once infamously proclaimed: \"I want every girl in the world to pick up a guitar and start screaming...[345] I strap on that motherfucking guitar and you cannot fuck with me. That's my feeling.\"[346] In The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon, it is noted: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}[Love] truly lived up to Paul Westerberg's (The Replacements) assessment of pretty girls 'playing makeup/wearing guitar'\u00a0... She frequently stood on stage, microphone in hand and foot on monitor, and simply let her Fender guitar dangle around her neck. She truly embodied the empowerment that came with playing the electric guitar\u00a0... Love depended heavily upon her male lead guitar foil Eric Erlandson, but the rest of her band remained exclusively female throughout several lineup changes.[342]\n\u2013Love on having a cultural impact, 1997[347]\nWith over 3 million records sold in the United States alone,[d] Hole became one of the most successful rock bands of all time fronted by a woman.[344][349] VH1 ranked Love no. 69 in their list of The 100 Greatest Women in Music History in 2012.[350] In 2015, the Phoenix New Times declared Love the number one greatest female rock star of all time, writing: \"To build a perfect rock star, there are several crucial ingredients: musical talent, physical attractiveness, tumultuous relationships, substance abuse, and public meltdowns, just to name a few. These days, Love seems to have rebounded from her epic tailspin and has leveled out in a slightly more normal manner, but there's no doubt that her life to date is the type of story people wouldn't believe in a novel or a movie.\"[351]\nAmong the alternative musicians who have cited Love as an influence are Scout Niblett;[352] Brody Dalle of The Distillers;[353] Dee Dee Penny of Dum Dum Girls;[354] and Nine Black Alps.[355] Contemporary female pop artists Lana Del Rey,[356] Avril Lavigne,[357] Tove Lo,[358] and Sky Ferreira[359] have also cited Love as an influence. Love has frequently been recognized as the most high-profile contributor of feminist music during the 1990s,[360] and for \"subverting [the] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound.\"[361] According to music journalist Maria Raha, \"Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism.\"[362] Patti Smith, a major influence of Love's, also praised her, saying: \"I hate genderizing things\u00a0... [but] when I heard Hole, I was amazed to hear a girl sing like that. Janis Joplin was her own thing; she was into Big Mama Thornton and Bessie Smith. But what Courtney Love does, I'd never heard a girl do that.\"[363]\nShe has also been a gay icon since the mid-1990s,[364] and has jokingly referred to her fanbase as consisting of \"females, gay guys, and a few advanced, evolved heterosexual men.\"[330] Love's aesthetic image, particularly in the early 1990s, also became influential, and was dubbed \"kinderwhore\" by critics and media. The subversive fashion mainly consisted of vintage babydoll dresses accompanied by smeared makeup and red lipstick.[94][365] MTV reporter Kurt Loder described Love as looking like \"a debauched rag doll\" onstage.[366][367] Love later said she had been influenced by the fashion of Chrissy Amphlett of the Divinyls.[368] Interviewed in 1994, Love commented \"I would like to think\u2013in my heart of hearts\u2013that I'm changing some psychosexual aspects of rock music. Not that I'm so desirable. I didn't do the kinder-whore thing because I thought I was so hot. When I see the look used to make one more appealing, it pisses me off. When I started, it was a What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? thing. My angle was irony.\" [369]\nHole discography\nSolo discography\nFilmography\nBibliography\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nCiara Princess Harris (/si\u02c8\u025br\u0259/ see-ERR-\u0259; born October 25, 1985)[1][2] is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and model. Born in Austin, Texas, she traveled around the world during her childhood, eventually moving to Atlanta, Georgia where she joined the girl group Hearsay. She later signed a publishing deal, and befriended producer Jazze Pha, who recorded demos that would appear on her debut album. With his help, Ciara signed a record deal with LaFace Records. In 2004, Ciara released her debut studio album Goodies, which spawned four singles: \"Goodies\", \"1, 2 Step\", \"Oh\" and \"And I\". \"Goodies\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and garnered four nominations at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. Ciara was also featured on Missy Elliott's \"Lose Control\" and Bow Wow's \"Like You\", both of which reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution, which spawned the hit singles \"Get Up\", \"Promise\", \"Like a Boy\" and \"Can't Leave 'em Alone\". The album reached number one in the U.S. and was certified platinum. Ciara's third studio album, Fantasy Ride (2009) was less successful than her first two albums. However, it produced the international top-ten single \"Love Sex Magic\", featuring Justin Timberlake, which received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. The following year, Ciara released her fourth studio album Basic Instinct, which included the R&B top-five single \"Ride\", but was met with low sales, continuing a downward trend in her commercial performance. Ciara signed a new record deal with Epic Records in 2011. In 2013, she released her fifth studio album, Ciara, which spawned the R&B top-ten single \"Body Party\". Her sixth album, Jackie (2015), included the singles \"I Bet\" and \"Dance like We're Making Love\". In 2006, Ciara made her film debut in All You've Got, and later appeared in the films Mama, I Want to Sing! (2012) and That's My Boy (2012). In 2013, she had a recurring role in the US TV series, The Game. In 2016, Ciara signed a signed a modeling contract with IMG.[3] That year, she became a Global Brand Ambassador for the cosmetics giant Revlon.[4] Since making her musical debut in 2004, Ciara has attained eight Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles. She has also received many awards, including three BET Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, three MOBO Awards, and one Grammy Award. As of 2015, Ciara has sold over 23 million records worldwide.[5] In 2016, she married quarterback Russell Wilson. Ciara Princess Harris was born in Austin, Texas, on October 25, 1985,[1] the only child of Jackie and Carlton Clay Harris.[6] An army brat, she grew up in Germany, New York, Utah, California, Arizona, and Nevada.[7] She was named after the Revlon fragrance \"Ciara\" which was introduced in 1973 and is still sold today.[8] During her teens, Ciara and her family settled in Atlanta, Georgia.[7] In her mid-teens, Ciara formed the all-girl group Hearsay with two of her friends.[who?] The group recorded demos, but as time went on, they began to have differences and eventually parted ways.[7] Despite this setback, Ciara was still determined to reach her goal and signed a publishing deal as a songwriter. Her first writing credit was on Blu Cantrell\u2019s debut album, So Blu for the song \u201c10,000 Times.\u201d She also wrote the song \"Got Me Waiting\" for R&B singer Fantasia Barrino's debut album, Free Yourself.[7] It was when she was writing songs that she met music producer, Jazze Pha, whom she called her \"music soulmate.\" In 2002, the two recorded four demos, \"1, 2 Step\", \"Thug Style,\" \"Pick Up the Phone,\" and \"Lookin' at You,\" which all appeared on her debut album, which was released two years later. \"1, 2 Step\" was the second single released from it and became a hit.[7] After graduating from Riverdale High School in Riverdale, Georgia in 2003, she was signed by LaFace Records executive, L.A. Reid, whom she was introduced to by Jazze Pha.[9] She began production on her debut album later that year. In early 2004, she wrote a demo with record producer, Sean Garrett, which came to the attention of Lil Jon and became her debut single \"Goodies\". Lil Jon stated later that he knew it would be big seeing how it sounded similar to Usher's international hit, \"Yeah!.\"[7] Ciara released her debut album Goodies on September 28, 2004. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 124,750 copies in its initial week[10] and topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Following the release of the album, Ciara was hailed as the \"First Lady of Crunk&B\". Goodies had a seventy-one-week run on the Billboard 200, and was certified three times-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 10, 2006.[11] The album has sold around nearly 3 million copies in the United States as of June 2010.[12] Charting at twenty-two on the Canadian Albums Chart, it was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.[13] The album charted at twenty-six on the UK Albums Chart, and spent twenty weeks on the chart.[14] It was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry, remaining to be Ciara's sole certified album in the UK.[14] Goodies' lead single, the title track, featuring Petey Pablo, was released on June 8, 2004. Conceived as a crunk female counterpart to Usher's \"Yeah!\", the lyrical content goes against the grain, speaking of abstinence, rejecting advances because \"the goodies will stay in the jar.\" Critics hailed it as an \"anthem of the summer\" and one of the best singles of the year, complementing its dance-feel and beat, and the irony of the \"clever\" lyrics. The single performed well worldwide, topping the charts in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, and charting in the top ten of other charts, receiving Platinum certification in the United States.[15][16] \"1, 2 Step\" featuring Missy Elliott was released as the album's second single.[17] The song peaked in the top ten of many countries, topping the charts in Canada, and went on to become Platinum or Gold in many countries.[15][16] \"Oh\" featuring Ludacris was released as the third single on March 5, 2005. The song performed well worldwide, appearing in the top ten of seven charts, and certified either Platinum or Gold in multiple regions.[15][16] Following the success of the album, Ciara released a CD/DVD entitled Goodies: The Videos & More in the United States on July 12, 2005 which featured remixes to \"1, 2 Step\" and \"Oh\", as well as two new songs. The release was certified platinum in the United States. She made guest appearances on Missy Elliott's single \"Lose Control\" and on Bow Wow's single \"Like You\", which both peaked at number three in the United States and obtained worldwide success. She was an opening act for Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005 and went on tour with Chris Brown and Bow Wow on the Holiday Jam Tour in December 2005. At the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, Ciara received four nominations for Best New Artist, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"1, 2 Step\", Best Rap Song for Missy Elliott's single \"Lose Control\", and won her last nomination, Best Short Form Music Video for Lose Control.[18] On December 5, 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution. According to the singer, the title of the album is \"about so much more than just my personal growth \u2013 it's about the evolution of music, the evolution of dance, the evolution of fashion.\"[19] The source of the album's creativity such as the sound and edge comes from Ciara in general.[20] Ciara: The Evolution became Ciara's first number one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and second on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts with sales of more than 338,000 becoming her highest first week of sales to date. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, within only five weeks of its release, and has sold 1.3\u00a0million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan.[12] It sold over two million copies worldwide.[21] The album's international lead single, \"Get Up\", which features Chamillionaire, reached number seven in the United States and gained a platinum accreditation. It reached number five in New Zealand.[22] The song was used for the film Step Up (2006) and featured on the film's soundtrack. The album's US lead single, \"Promise\", reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her third number one single on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Like a Boy\" was released as the second international single which reached within the top twenty in the UK,[23] Finland,[24] France, Ireland, Sweden[25] Switzerland, and also in the United States.[26] The fourth and final single from the album, \"Can't Leave 'em Alone\", reached number 10 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] The song became Ciara's fifth single to peak in the top in New Zealand, peaking at number 4.[28] The song achieved moderate success in other international markets. In support of the album, Ciara went on her first headlining tour in October 2006. The tour went to seventeen different clubs in cities throughout the United States. The tour was met with mixed to positive reviews; critics were divided regarding the pre-recorded backing tracks and remarked that Ciara was slightly under-prepared to host her own headlining tour, but ultimately praised her energetic choreography. In August 2007, she headlined the Screamfest '07 tour with fellow rapper, T.I.. Critics praised her performance for her gracious dancing and being able to command a sold-out arena.[29] Ciara, along with Chris Brown and Akon, was a support act for Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in the United Kingdom. She made a guest appearance on \"So What\" by Field Mob. The single went on to become a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. She also appeared on Tiffany Evans' single \"Promise Ring\". The song achieved little success on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In addition to her music, Ciara made her acting debut in the MTV Films production All You've Got in May 2006. In the movie she played Becca Whiley, a teenager who is competing in a volleyball tournament. The movie received mixed to positive reviews; critics said the movie was predictable but still enjoyable.[30] In October 2008, Ciara was honored as Billboard's \"Woman of the Year\", because of her success as a recording artist and leadership in embracing the changing music business.[31] Although her third album was originally scheduled for a September 2008 release, Fantasy Ride was released after a number of delays in May 2009. The album combines her R&B and hip hop sound from her previous albums along with a new pop and dance sound. While talking to MTV News, Ciara said, \"I'm having a bit more fun with my lyrics. I'm not afraid. In the beginning, I was conscious and really protective and somewhat scared in reference to doing some things. With this album I'm not holding back, there's a freedom. It's just the space I'm in right now.\"[32] It became Ciara's first top ten album in the UK and Canada. In the United States, Fantasy Ride debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, becoming Ciara's third consecutive album to debut within the top three on the chart. To date,[when?] it has sold 193,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[12] \"Go Girl\" was the first single released from the album. It was originally the lead single from the album, but the single achieved minimum success and was later deemed a promo single. However, the single managed to reach the top of the charts in Japan. The album's official lead single, \"Never Ever\", which features Young Jeezy, was released in the United States in January 2009 and reached a peak of number nine on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The second single, \"Love Sex Magic\", featuring Justin Timberlake, became a worldwide hit, peaking within the top ten in twenty countries including the U.S., where it peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. It went on to be certified platinum in Australia[33] and received a gold accreditation in New Zealand.[34] It received a nomination for \"Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals\" at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards and also for Best Choreography in a Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. \"Like A Surgeon\" was the fourth single from the album. The song received no promotion and no single cover nor music video was released. However, the song did manage to peak at number fifty-nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart from airplay alone.[35] \"Work\", the final single, achieved moderate success in international markets. In July 2009, Ciara headlined the Jay-Z & Ciara Live tour with Jay-Z. Her performance received mixed reviews; critics said although her dancing was top-notch, she seemed disconnected from the crowd.[36] She was also the support act for Britney Spears's Circus tour, where she performed eight nights at London's prestigious O2 Arena during June 2009.[37] Her performance received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, who noted her dancing skills as being spectacular and arguably better than Britney Spears'.[38] Ciara made a guest appearance on Nelly's single \"Stepped On My J'z\" from his album Brass Knuckles. The song achieved minimal success in the U.S.. Ciara was also featured on Enrique Iglesias' single, \"Takin' Back My Love\", from his Greatest Hits album. The song became an international hit, peaking in the top ten of over fifteen countries, and being certified Gold in Russia, with sales of over 100,000. In February 2010, Ciara along with Pitbull were featured on the remix to Ludacris' hit single \"How Low\". The following month, Ciara made a cameo appearance in the music video of Usher's single, \"Lil' Freak\". Ciara released her fourth studio album, Basic Instinct, on December 14, 2010. She told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul magazine that the album is about her trusting her instinct and going back to the R&B/urban basics, in the days of \"Goodies\" and \"1, 2 Step\".[39] It was executively produced by the singer alongside her A&R agent Mark Pitts and writing/production duo Tricky Stewart and The-Dream who also produced records for her previous album, Fantasy Ride. Basic Instinct debuted at number forty-four on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 37,000 copies, becoming her only album to not peak within the top three.[40] On the U.S. R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, the album opened at number eleven,[41] her only album to not peak within the top two of the chart. The lead single, \"Ride\", which features Ludacris, was released on April 26, 2010. It peaked at number forty-two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, number three on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,[42] becoming her twelfth top ten hit on the chart,[43] and number seventy-five on the UK Singles Chart.[44] The accompanying music video won the award for \"Best Dance Performance\" at the 2010 Soul Train Music Awards.[45] \"Speechless\" was released as the second single from the album and achieved minimal success, peaking at only number seventy-four on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[26] \"Gimmie Dat\", the third single from the album was praised by critics but failed to become a hit, peaking at only sixty-three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,[26] and number twenty-seven on the urban charts in the UK.[46] In November 2010, Ciara performed at the Summerbeatz tour alongside Flo Rida, Jay Sean, Akon, Travie McCoy and Ja Rule.[47] In the summer of 2011, Ciara was a part of the Malibu Rum Tour. She performed in seven shows across the US.[48] In February 2011, following rumors that Ciara had been dropped by Jive Records, she released an official statement to her Facebook page complaining of inadequate promotion and funding from the label. She stated that she received a lack of support from the label, and even paid for the promotion of some singles, such as \"Gimmie Dat\", herself. The frustration she felt while working with her third and fourth albums led her to request that she be released from her contract.[49] In May 2011, Ciara was removed from the Jive Records website roster.[50] On July 12, 2011, it was reported that she had reunited with L.A. Reid by signing with his record label Epic Records,[51] and was confirmed in September 2011.[52] During an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album, stating: \"It's just really about the vibe, and I'll just tell you that it's a good vibe going. It's really important for me to take my time with this record and it's important for the whole team. It's really, really good energy.\"[53] She has been working on the album with a number of producers and songwriters, including Hit-Boy, Soundz, Diane Warren, Tricky Stewart, and The Underdogs.[54][55][56] In an interview, Ciara said \"I worked with some people that are very fresh, which I'm excited about... When it comes to artists, when it comes to writers, when it comes to producers, I really wanted to push. We pretty much reached out and worked with a lot of people that I've never worked with before, which is really fun.\"[57] During a press conference with MTV in May 2012, Ciara announced her fifth studio album would be titled One Woman Army and said the lead single, \"Sweat\", would be out very soon.[58][59] The single, which features rapper 2 Chainz, premiered online on June 4, 2012, and was to be released via iTunes on June 19, 2012.[60] However, the release of the single was scrapped at the last minute for unknown reasons.

Instead, it was later announced that a new song titled \"Body Party\" would serve as the lead single. It was released in March 2013 and so far reaching number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the U.S. Billboard \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\" chart .

After claims of Future's infidelity during their relationship had surfaced, it was reported that the couple's engagement had been called off.[77] Following their very public break-up, Ciara's album release was further postponed to 2015,[76] and during this time the singer \"quietly\" recorded new music, while concentrating on motherhood.[78] \"I Bet\", the lead single from her upcoming album Jackie, was released on January 26, 2015.[79][80] In May 2015, Ciara embarked on her first headlining tour in six years.

Ciara's music is generally contemporary R&B, but it also incorporates other genres including hip hop, crunk, dance-pop, electropop and funk. Critics have described her singles \"Goodies\", \"1, 2 Step\", \"Get Up\", and \"Go Girl\" as club bangers.[99] Ciara's debut album featured production from Jazze Pha who discovered her. Critics compared the album to late singer Aaliyah[100][101] and said it had qualities of Destiny's Child.[101] On her second album, Ciara worked with one of her debut album collaborators Lil Jon on \"That's Right\", sampling Pretty Tony's \"Fix It in the Mix\".[102] She has also taken to sampling songs from other artist such as, Lyn Collins's \"Think (About It)\" and Rob Base's \"It Takes Two\" on \"Make It Last Forever\",[102] Jive Rhythm Trax's 80's electro cut \"122 BPM\" on \"C.R.U.S.H\"[103] and also Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes' \"If You Don't Know Me by Now\", sampling the chorus of the song onto \"Never Ever\".[96] Ciara said that watching Destiny's Child and Janet Jackson perform on television inspired her to pursue a career in music,[7] and cites Jackson and her brother Michael as her biggest inspirations.[104] Ciara considered herself to reach \"a career pinnacle\" when she featured on Janet Jackson's 2008 album Discipline. She has cited Beyonc\u00e9 as an influence, citing her career longevity as an influence continuing to say \"I have a lot of respect for her. I respect any woman that works hard and gets success from the hard work that they put into it\".[105] Ciara spoke of Michael Jackson's legacy, \"Whenever someone asks me who inspires me to do what I do, I always say Michael. That's it for me. He's everything to me. He's really a part of the reason why. He's going to be remembered in so many ways for me. I feel it's important for me to continue to let my generation know how important he was to music.\"[106] Ciara also cites Whitney Houston, Aaliyah, TLC, SWV, Monica and Salt-N-Pepa, as influences.[107] Her second studio album Ciara: The Evolution (2006) was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince, and pop singer Madonna.[108] During the recording of her fifth self-titled album Ciara (2013), she was inspired by Al Green and Missy Elliott.[109] \u2014 Ciara, speaking on her alter ego Super C.[110] Ciara has received praise for her stage presence and routines during live performances. Dalondo Moultrie of The Morning Call's praised Ciara's stage presence saying that she \"put on one of the best performances I have seen yet at [Crocodile Rock]\".[111] Moultrie continued to call her dance steps \"incredible\", noting that it was in sync with the music, \"each pelvic thrust or body-bending twist\" and the periodic bursts of light. In conclusion, Moultrie praised Ciara's live performances and their \"high-energy songs, sexy dance moves, flawless vocals and a top-flight light show\".[111] Sia Michel of The New York Times praised Ciara's relentless professional presence stating: \"Ciara led a squad of hip-hop dancers through stylishly choreographed routines. Striding about in a headset, she was a commanding and relentlessly professional presence.\"[112] At the time of the release of Fantasy Ride (2009) Ciara introduced her alter ego \"Super C\". Ciara said that Super C is her \"inner strength and aggressive persona\" \u2013 a futuristic, superhero-esque woman, loosely based on the robotic character Ciara portrayed in the \"Go Girl\" music video. Ciara described her reasoning for developing an alter ego, \"There's so much negative energy in the world, especially within the blogging world, they try so hard to tear you down. [With the superhero concept] it's like, 'I refuse to let you and that negative energy tear me down or stop any blessing that I know is there for me.' That's when the inner superhero comes out.\"[113] With the release of her debut single \"Goodies\", Ciara was referred to as the Princess of Crunk&B.[95] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post commented that she has a \"reedy, agile voice, capable of conveying the only three emotions (sexy, sassy, sad) an R&B singer needs.[96] Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times commented that \"Ciara has been the most synthetic of the R&B divas over the past decade, an electro-leaning vocalist whose instrumental palate has heavily favored stark 808 beats, sassy and seductive vocal lines.\"[114] In the early to mid-2000s, some crunk music hits like \"Get Low\", \"Goodies\", \"Yeah!\" and \"Freek-a-Leek\" produced by Lil Jon climbed to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Both \"Yeah!\" and \"Goodies\" were the first tracks to introduce the substyle of crunk music and contemporary R&B, called crunk&B, to the public. Both of those tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were the main mainstream hits of 2004.[115] Since then, crunk&B has been one of the most popular genres of sung African-American music, along with electropop, the genre that replaced crunk and crunk&B in the charts in 2008. After the album's lead single reached the summit of the US Billboard Hot 100, it spent seven weeks at number one, becoming the longest-running number-one debut single by a female artist since 1977[116] The album's lead single's success exemplified urban music's commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the Billboard charts by R&B and hip hop artists.[117] In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&B hits that year.[117] Along with Usher's streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&B charts were topped by OutKast's \"Hey Ya!\", Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", Terror Squad's \"Lean Back\", and Ciara's \"Goodies\".[117] Chris Molanphy of The Village Voice later remarked that \"by the early 2000s, urban music was pop music.\"[117] Ciara is married to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. They began dating in early 2015 and announced their engagement on March 11, 2016.[118][119] They were married on July 6, 2016, at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England.[120] Together, they have one child, a daughter, born on April 28, 2017.[121] In January 2020, Ciara announced they were expecting their second child together.[122] Ciara also has a son, born on May 19, 2014, from her previous relationship with Future.[123] Ciara and Future were engaged in October 2013, but ended the engagement in August 2014.[124] Ciara became the face of Jay-Z's Rocawear clothing line and spokesperson for the women campaign entitled \"I Will Not Lose\", which debuted in the summer of 2007. In the October issue of Vibe Magazine, she appeared, apparently nude, on the magazine cover but claimed Vibe had airbrushed her clothes off. She told MTV News that she was hurt by the photos and was quite shocked when she finally got her hands on the month's issue. She later confirmed that she was in fact clothed.[125] In September 2008, Ciara contributed to the song \"Just Stand Up!\" with fifteen other female artists, who shared the stage to perform the song live on September 5, 2008 during the \"Stand Up to Cancer\" television special.

After signing the deal she has been in many magazine spreads. In addition to that, she also has her eyes set on beginning a new clothing line. In June 2008, she was in talks with the department store Steve & Barry's to create an affordable clothing line,[130] but it never happened. On November 9, 2009, it was announced that Ciara would be modeling in the German edition of Vogue.[131] During that time, it was also announced that Ciara would be the new face of a major multimedia ad campaign for Verizon's smartphone the LG Chocolate Touch. Ciara filmed a commercial for the campaign, which features her dancing to her 2009 single, \"Work\".[132] In March 2010, it was officially confirmed and announced that Ciara was the spokesperson in the new ad campaign for Adidas Originals.

The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and garnered four nominations at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards.

Ciara signed a new record deal with Epic Records in 2011. In 2013, she released her fifth studio album, Ciara, which spawned the R&amp;B top-ten single \"Body Party\". Her sixth album, Jackie (2015), included the singles \"I Bet\" and \"Dance like We're Making Love\".\nIn 2006, Ciara made her film debut in All You've Got, and later appeared in the films Mama, I Want to Sing!

As of 2015, Ciara has sold over 23 million records worldwide.[5] In 2016, she married quarterback Russell Wilson.\nCiara Princess Harris was born in Austin, Texas, on October 25, 1985,[1] the only child of Jackie and Carlton Clay Harris.[6] An army brat, she grew up in Germany, New York, Utah, California, Arizona, and Nevada.[7] She was named after the Revlon fragrance \"Ciara\" which was introduced in 1973 and is still sold today.[8] During her teens, Ciara and her family settled in Atlanta, Georgia.[7]\nIn her mid-teens, Ciara formed the all-girl group Hearsay with two of her friends.[who?] The group recorded demos, but as time went on, they began to have differences and eventually parted ways.[7] Despite this setback, Ciara was still determined to reach her goal and signed a publishing deal as a songwriter.\nHer first writing credit was on Blu Cantrell\u2019s debut album, So Blu for the song \u201c10,000 Times.\u201d She also wrote the song \"Got Me Waiting\" for R&amp;B singer Fantasia Barrino's debut album, Free Yourself.[7] It was when she was writing songs that she met music producer, Jazze Pha, whom she called her \"music soulmate.\" In 2002, the two recorded four demos, \"1, 2 Step\", \"Thug Style,\" \"Pick Up the Phone,\" and \"Lookin' at You,\" which all appeared on her debut album, which was released two years later. \"1, 2 Step\" was the second single released from it and became a hit.[7]\nAfter graduating from Riverdale High School in Riverdale, Georgia in 2003, she was signed by LaFace Records executive, L.A. Reid, whom she was introduced to by Jazze Pha.[9] She began production on her debut album later that year. In early 2004, she wrote a demo with record producer, Sean Garrett, which came to the attention of Lil Jon and became her debut single \"Goodies\". Lil Jon stated later that he knew it would be big seeing how it sounded similar to Usher's international hit, \"Yeah!.\"[7]\nCiara released her debut album Goodies on September 28, 2004. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 124,750 copies in its initial week[10] and topped the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Following the release of the album, Ciara was hailed as the \"First Lady of Crunk&amp;B\". Goodies had a seventy-one-week run on the Billboard 200, and was certified three times-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 10, 2006.[11] The album has sold around nearly 3 million copies in the United States as of June 2010.[12] Charting at twenty-two on the Canadian Albums Chart, it was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.[13] The album charted at twenty-six on the UK Albums Chart, and spent twenty weeks on the chart.[14] It was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry, remaining to be Ciara's sole certified album in the UK.[14]\nGoodies' lead single, the title track, featuring Petey Pablo, was released on June 8, 2004. Conceived as a crunk female counterpart to Usher's \"Yeah!\", the lyrical content goes against the grain, speaking of abstinence, rejecting advances because \"the goodies will stay in the jar.\" Critics hailed it as an \"anthem of the summer\" and one of the best singles of the year, complementing its dance-feel and beat, and the irony of the \"clever\" lyrics. The single performed well worldwide, topping the charts in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, and charting in the top ten of other charts, receiving Platinum certification in the United States.[15][16] \"1, 2 Step\" featuring Missy Elliott was released as the album's second single.[17] The song peaked in the top ten of many countries, topping the charts in Canada, and went on to become Platinum or Gold in many countries.[15][16] \"Oh\" featuring Ludacris was released as the third single on March 5, 2005.

At the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, Ciara received four nominations for Best New Artist, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"1, 2 Step\", Best Rap Song for Missy Elliott's single \"Lose Control\", and won her last nomination, Best Short Form Music Video for Lose Control.[18]\nOn December 5, 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution. According to the singer, the title of the album is \"about so much more than just my personal growth \u2013 it's about the evolution of music, the evolution of dance, the evolution of fashion.\"[19] The source of the album's creativity such as the sound and edge comes from Ciara in general.[20] Ciara: The Evolution became Ciara's first number one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and second on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts with sales of more than 338,000 becoming her highest first week of sales to date. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, within only five weeks of its release, and has sold 1.3\u00a0million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan.[12] It sold over two million copies worldwide.[21]\nThe album's international lead single, \"Get Up\", which features Chamillionaire, reached number seven in the United States and gained a platinum accreditation. It reached number five in New Zealand.[22] The song was used for the film Step Up (2006) and featured on the film's soundtrack. The album's US lead single, \"Promise\", reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her third number one single on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Like a Boy\" was released as the second international single which reached within the top twenty in the UK,[23] Finland,[24] France, Ireland, Sweden[25] Switzerland, and also in the United States.[26] The fourth and final single from the album, \"Can't Leave 'em Alone\", reached number 10 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.[27] The song became Ciara's fifth single to peak in the top in New Zealand, peaking at number 4.[28] The song achieved moderate success in other international markets.\nIn support of the album, Ciara went on her first headlining tour in October 2006. The tour went to seventeen different clubs in cities throughout the United States. The tour was met with mixed to positive reviews; critics were divided regarding the pre-recorded backing tracks and remarked that Ciara was slightly under-prepared to host her own headlining tour, but ultimately praised her energetic choreography. In August 2007, she headlined the Screamfest '07 tour with fellow rapper, T.I.. Critics praised her performance for her gracious dancing and being able to command a sold-out arena.[29] Ciara, along with Chris Brown and Akon, was a support act for Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in the United Kingdom. She made a guest appearance on \"So What\" by Field Mob. The single went on to become a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. She also appeared on Tiffany Evans' single \"Promise Ring\". The song achieved little success on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\nIn addition to her music, Ciara made her acting debut in the MTV Films production All You've Got in May 2006.

The movie received mixed to positive reviews; critics said the movie was predictable but still enjoyable.[30]\nIn October 2008, Ciara was honored as Billboard's \"Woman of the Year\", because of her success as a recording artist and leadership in embracing the changing music business.[31]\nAlthough her third album was originally scheduled for a September 2008 release, Fantasy Ride was released after a number of delays in May 2009. The album combines her R&amp;B and hip hop sound from her previous albums along with a new pop and dance sound. While talking to MTV News, Ciara said, \"I'm having a bit more fun with my lyrics. I'm not afraid. In the beginning, I was conscious and really protective and somewhat scared in reference to doing some things. With this album I'm not holding back, there's a freedom. It's just the space I'm in right now.\"[32] It became Ciara's first top ten album in the UK and Canada. In the United States, Fantasy Ride debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, becoming Ciara's third consecutive album to debut within the top three on the chart. To date,[when?] it has sold 193,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[12]\n\"Go Girl\" was the first single released from the album. It was originally the lead single from the album, but the single achieved minimum success and was later deemed a promo single. However, the single managed to reach the top of the charts in Japan. The album's official lead single, \"Never Ever\", which features Young Jeezy, was released in the United States in January 2009 and reached a peak of number nine on the U.S. Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. The second single, \"Love Sex Magic\", featuring Justin Timberlake, became a worldwide hit, peaking within the top ten in twenty countries including the U.S., where it peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100.

The song received no promotion and no single cover nor music video was released. However, the song did manage to peak at number fifty-nine on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart from airplay alone.[35] \"Work\", the final single, achieved moderate success in international markets.\nIn July 2009, Ciara headlined the Jay-Z &amp; Ciara Live tour with Jay-Z. Her performance received mixed reviews; critics said although her dancing was top-notch, she seemed disconnected from the crowd.[36] She was also the support act for Britney Spears's Circus tour, where she performed eight nights at London's prestigious O2 Arena during June 2009.[37] Her performance received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, who noted her dancing skills as being spectacular and arguably better than Britney Spears'.[38] Ciara made a guest appearance on Nelly's single \"Stepped On My J'z\" from his album Brass Knuckles. The song achieved minimal success in the U.S.. Ciara was also featured on Enrique Iglesias' single, \"Takin' Back My Love\", from his Greatest Hits album. The song became an international hit, peaking in the top ten of over fifteen countries, and being certified Gold in Russia, with sales of over 100,000. In February 2010, Ciara along with Pitbull were featured on the remix to Ludacris' hit single \"How Low\". The following month, Ciara made a cameo appearance in the music video of Usher's single, \"Lil' Freak\".\nCiara released her fourth studio album, Basic Instinct, on December 14, 2010. She told Pete Lewis of Blues &amp; Soul magazine that the album is about her trusting her instinct and going back to the R&amp;B/urban basics, in the days of \"Goodies\" and \"1, 2 Step\".[39] It was executively produced by the singer alongside her A&amp;R agent Mark Pitts and writing/production duo Tricky Stewart and The-Dream who also produced records for her previous album, Fantasy Ride. Basic Instinct debuted at number forty-four on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 37,000 copies, becoming her only album to not peak within the top three.[40] On the U.S. R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, the album opened at number eleven,[41] her only album to not peak within the top two of the chart.\nThe lead single, \"Ride\", which features Ludacris, was released on April 26, 2010.

She performed in seven shows across the US.[48]\nIn February 2011, following rumors that Ciara had been dropped by Jive Records, she released an official statement to her Facebook page complaining of inadequate promotion and funding from the label. She stated that she received a lack of support from the label, and even paid for the promotion of some singles, such as \"Gimmie Dat\", herself. The frustration she felt while working with her third and fourth albums led her to request that she be released from her contract.[49] In May 2011, Ciara was removed from the Jive Records website roster.[50] On July 12, 2011, it was reported that she had reunited with L.A. Reid by signing with his record label Epic Records,[51] and was confirmed in September 2011.[52]\nDuring an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album, stating: \"It's just really about the vibe, and I'll just tell you that it's a good vibe going. It's really important for me to take my time with this record and it's important for the whole team. It's really, really good energy.\"[53] She has been working on the album with a number of producers and songwriters, including Hit-Boy, Soundz, Diane Warren, Tricky Stewart, and The Underdogs.[54][55][56] In an interview, Ciara said \"I worked with some people that are very fresh, which I'm excited about... When it comes to artists, when it comes to writers, when it comes to producers, I really wanted to push. We pretty much reached out and worked with a lot of people that I've never worked with before, which is really fun.\"[57]\nDuring a press conference with MTV in May 2012, Ciara announced her fifth studio album would be titled One Woman Army and said the lead single, \"Sweat\", would be out very soon.[58][59] The single, which features rapper 2 Chainz, premiered online on June 4, 2012, and was to be released via iTunes on June 19, 2012.[60] However, the release of the single was scrapped at the last minute for unknown reasons.

Ciara's music is generally contemporary R&amp;B, but it also incorporates other genres including hip hop, crunk, dance-pop, electropop and funk.

She has cited Beyonc\u00e9 as an influence, citing her career longevity as an influence continuing to say \"I have a lot of respect for her. I respect any woman that works hard and gets success from the hard work that they put into it\".[105]\nCiara spoke of Michael Jackson's legacy, \"Whenever someone asks me who inspires me to do what I do, I always say Michael. That's it for me. He's everything to me. He's really a part of the reason why. He's going to be remembered in so many ways for me. I feel it's important for me to continue to let my generation know how important he was to music.\"[106] Ciara also cites Whitney Houston, Aaliyah, TLC, SWV, Monica and Salt-N-Pepa, as influences.[107] Her second studio album Ciara: The Evolution (2006) was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince, and pop singer Madonna.[108]\nDuring the recording of her fifth self-titled album Ciara (2013), she was inspired by Al Green and Missy Elliott.[109]\n\u2014 Ciara, speaking on her alter ego Super C.[110]\nCiara has received praise for her stage presence and routines during live performances.

Striding about in a headset, she was a commanding and relentlessly professional presence.\"[112]\nAt the time of the release of Fantasy Ride (2009) Ciara introduced her alter ego \"Super C\". Ciara said that Super C is her \"inner strength and aggressive persona\" \u2013 a futuristic, superhero-esque woman, loosely based on the robotic character Ciara portrayed in the \"Go Girl\" music video. Ciara described her reasoning for developing an alter ego, \"There's so much negative energy in the world, especially within the blogging world, they try so hard to tear you down. [With the superhero concept] it's like, 'I refuse to let you and that negative energy tear me down or stop any blessing that I know is there for me.' That's when the inner superhero comes out.\"[113]\nWith the release of her debut single \"Goodies\", Ciara was referred to as the Princess of Crunk&amp;B.[95] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post commented that she has a \"reedy, agile voice, capable of conveying the only three emotions (sexy, sassy, sad) an R&amp;B singer needs.[96] Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times commented that \"Ciara has been the most synthetic of the R&amp;B divas over the past decade, an electro-leaning vocalist whose instrumental palate has heavily favored stark 808 beats, sassy and seductive vocal lines.\"[114]\nIn the early to mid-2000s, some crunk music hits like \"Get Low\", \"Goodies\", \"Yeah!\" and \"Freek-a-Leek\" produced by Lil Jon climbed to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Both \"Yeah!\" and \"Goodies\" were the first tracks to introduce the substyle of crunk music and contemporary R&amp;B, called crunk&amp;B, to the public. Both of those tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were the main mainstream hits of 2004.[115] Since then, crunk&amp;B has been one of the most popular genres of sung African-American music, along with electropop, the genre that replaced crunk and crunk&amp;B in the charts in 2008. After the album's lead single reached the summit of the US Billboard Hot 100, it spent seven weeks at number one, becoming the longest-running number-one debut single by a female artist since 1977[116]\nThe album's lead single's success exemplified urban music's commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the Billboard charts by R&amp;B and hip hop artists.[117] In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&amp;B hits that year.[117] Along with Usher's streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&amp;B charts were topped by OutKast's \"Hey Ya!\", Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", Terror Squad's \"Lean Back\", and Ciara's \"Goodies\".[117] Chris Molanphy of The Village Voice later remarked that \"by the early 2000s, urban music was pop music.\"[117]\nCiara is married to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. They began dating in early 2015 and announced their engagement on March 11, 2016.[118][119] They were married on July 6, 2016, at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England.[120] Together, they have one child, a daughter, born on April 28, 2017.[121] In January 2020, Ciara announced they were expecting their second child together.[122]\nCiara also has a son, born on May 19, 2014, from her previous relationship with Future.[123] Ciara and Future were engaged in October 2013, but ended the engagement in August 2014.[124]\nCiara became the face of Jay-Z's Rocawear clothing line and spokesperson for the women campaign entitled \"I Will Not Lose\", which debuted in the summer of 2007.

                "text": "no title\n\nAlicia Augello-Cook (born January 25, 1981), known professionally as Alicia Keys, is an American musician, singer and composer. A classically-trained pianist, Keys was composing songs by age 12 and was signed at 15 years old by Columbia Records. After disputes with the label, she signed with Arista Records, and later released her debut album, Songs in A Minor, with J Records in 2001. The album was critically and commercially successful, producing her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"Fallin'\" and selling over 16 million copies worldwide. The album earned Keys five Grammy Awards in 2002. Her second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys (2003), was also a critical and commercial success, spawning successful singles \"You Don't Know My Name\", \"If I Ain't Got You\", and \"Diary\", and selling eight million copies worldwide.[1] The album garnered her an additional four Grammy Awards.[2] Her duet \"My Boo\" with Usher became her second number-one single in 2004. Keys released her first live album, Unplugged (2005), and became the first woman to have an MTV Unplugged album debut at number one. Her third album, As I Am (2007), produced the Hot 100 number-one single \"No One\", selling 7 million copies worldwide and earning an additional three Grammy Awards. In 2007, Keys made her film debut in the action-thriller film Smokin' Aces. She, along with Jack White, recorded \"Another Way to Die\" (the title song to the 22nd official James Bond film, Quantum of Solace). Her fourth album, The Element of Freedom (2009), became her first chart-topping album in the UK, and sold 4 million copies worldwide. In 2009, Keys also collaborated with Jay Z on \"Empire State of Mind\", which became her fourth number-one single and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Girl on Fire (2012) was her fifth Billboard 200 topping album, spawning the successful title track, and won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album. In 2013, VH1 Storytellers was released as her second live album. Her sixth studio album, Here (2016), became her seventh US R&B/Hip-Hop chart topping album. Keys has received numerous accolades in her career, including 15 competitive Grammy Awards, 17 NAACP Image Awards, 12 ASCAP Awards, and an award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and National Music Publishers Association. She has sold over 65 million records worldwide. Considered a musical icon, Keys was named by Billboard the top R&B artist of the 2000s decade and placed number 10 on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years. VH1 also included her on their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 100 Greatest Women in Music lists, while Time has named her in their 100 list of most influential people in 2005 and 2017. Keys is also acclaimed for her humanitarian work, philanthropy and activism. She co-founded and is the Global Ambassador of the nonprofit HIV/AIDS-fighting organization Keep a Child Alive. Alicia Augello Cook was born on January 25, 1981, in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City's Manhattan borough.[3][4] She is the only child of Teresa (Augello), who was a paralegal and part-time actress, and one of three children of Craig Cook, who was a flight attendant.[5][6][7] Keys' father is African American of Jamaican descent and her mother is of Italian descent; her maternal grandparents came from Sciacca in Sicily.[8] Keys states she also has some Scottish or Irish ancestry.[9] Named after her Puerto Rican godmother,[10] Keys expressed that she was comfortable with her multiracial heritage because she felt she was able to \"relate to different cultures\".[3][11] Keys' father left when she was two and she was subsequently raised by her mother during her formative years in Hell's Kitchen.[12] Keys said her parents never had a relationship, and her father was not in her life.[13] Although she did not like to speak about her father in order to not feed stereotypes, Keys remarked in 2001: \"I'm not in contact with him. That's fine. When I was younger, I minded about that. [It] made me angry. But it helped show me what a strong woman my mother was, and made me want to be strong like her. Probably, it was better for me this way.\"[3] Keys and her mother lived in a one-room apartment.[12] Her mother often worked three jobs to provide for Keys, who \"learned how to survive\" from her mother's example of tenacity and self-reliance.[12][14] \u2014Keys[14][15] From a young age, Alicia struggled with self-esteem issues, \"hiding\" little by little when her differences made her vulnerable to judgement, and later uninvited sexual attention.[16][17][18] Living in the rough neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen,[12][13] she was, from an early age, regularly exposed to street violence, drugs, prostitution, and subjected to sexual propositions in the sex trade- and crime-riddled area.[18][19][20] \"I saw a variety of people growing up, and lifestyles, lows and highs. I think it makes you realise right away what you want and what you don't want\", Keys said.[21] Keys recalled feeling fearful early on of the \"animal instinct\" she witnessed, and eventually feeling \"high\" due to recurrent harassment.[16][22] Her experiences in the streets had led her to carry a homemade knife for protection.[23][24] She became very wary,[24][25] emotionally guarded, and she began wearing gender-neutral clothing and what would become her trademark cornrows.[28] Keys explained that she is grateful for growing up where she did as it prepared her for the parallels in the music industry, particularly as she was a teenager starting out; she could maintain a particular focus and not derail herself.[18][29] She credits her \"tough\" mother for anchoring her on a right path as opposed to many people she knew who ended up on the wrong path and in jail. Keys attributed her unusual maturity as a young girl to her mother, who depended on her to be responsible while she worked to provide for them and give Keys as many opportunities as possible.[24][25] Keys loved music and singing from early childhood. She recalled her mother playing jazz records of artists like Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong on Sunday mornings, early musical moments Keys considers influential in kindling her interest in and emotional connection to music.[3][14] In preschool, Keys sung in her school's production of the musical Cats and was cast as Dorothy Gale in a production of The Wizard of Oz.[30] Keys discovered she had a passion for the piano by age six, as she loved the sound and feel of the instrument and desired to play and learn it.[15][31] A friend had given her an old, upright piano, a pivotal gift for Keys as it allowed her to play and take lessons as a child.[13] Keys began receiving classical piano training by age seven,[32] practicing six hours a day,[31] learning the Suzuki method and playing composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, and Satie.[13][33] She was particularly drawn to \"blue, dark, shadowy\" and melancholic compositions, as well as the passionate romanticism of \"blue composers\" like Chopin.[34] Inspired by the film Philadelphia, Keys wrote her first song about her departed grandfather on her piano by age 12. The scene in the film where Tom Hanks's character listens to opera on a record player notably affected Keys, who \"never showed emotion very well\".[15] After seeing the film, Keys, \"for the first time, could express how [she] felt through the music.\"[13][31] \u2014Keys[15] Keys' mother had encouraged her to participate in different extracurricular activities, including music, dance, theater, and gymnastics, so she could \"find her muse\".[30][35] Her extracurricular activities gave her focus and drive, and helped keep her out of trouble.[23][31][33] Keys remained so occupied with her various pursuits that she experienced her first burnout before adolescence. Before her 13th birthday, she expressed to her mother that she was too overwhelmed and wanted to disengage, at which point her mother took some time off with her and encouraged her to keep focusing on piano.[30] Keys would continue studying classical music until the age of 18.[31] Keys regards her education in classical piano and dedication to classical music as vital for her stability in her youth and her development as a musician and songwriter.[3][15] Keys later said of her classical background: That type of studying, that type of discipline...after a while, I realized what it provided me \u2013 focus, the ability to pay attention for a long enough period of time to make progress; the work ethic; the actual knowledge of music, that then unlocked the ability to write my own music, put my own chords and things I heard in my own head to different lyrics that I maybe felt, and I never, ever had to wait for anybody to write something for me.[36] Keys enrolled in the Professional Performing Arts School at the age of 12, where she took music, dance, and theater classes and majored in choir.[5][18] In her preteen years, Keys and her bass-playing friend formed their first group, though neither \"knew too much about how pop songs worked\".[13][33] Keys would continue singing, writing songs, and performing in musical groups throughout junior high and high school.[14][30][32] She became an accomplished pianist, and after her classical music teacher had nothing left to teach her, she began studying jazz at age 14.[35][37] Living in the \"musical melting pot\" city, Keys had already been discovering other genres of music, including soul music, hip hop, R&B, and taken affinity to artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield. Keen on dissecting music, Keys continued developing her songwriting and finding her own 'flow and style\" through her exploration of the intricacies in different music.[15][33][38] Keys spent more time in Harlem during her teenage years. She connected with the cultural and racial diversity in the neighborhood, where she expanded upon her musical exploration, and her character was also solidified. \"Harlem raised me in a lot of ways,\" Keys remarked. \"[It] taught me how to think fast, how to play the game...taught me leadership, how to get out of bad situations when you need to, how to hold my own.\"[3][32] During this period, she met her friend and future collaborator Kerry Brothers Jr.[14][32] In 1994, manager Jeff Robinson met 13-year old Keys, who participated in his brother's youth organization called Teens in Motion.[30][39] Robinson's brother had been giving Keys vocal lessons in Harlem.[31] His brother had talked to him about Keys and advised him to go see her, but Robinson shrugged it off as he had \"heard that story 1,000 times\". At the time, Keys was part of a three-girl band that had formed in the Bronx and was performing in Harlem.[30][37] Robinson eventually agreed to his brother's request, and went to see Keys perform with her group at the Police Athletic League center in Harlem. He was soon taken by Keys, her soulful singing, playing contemporary and classical music and performing her own songs.[30][32] Robinson was excited by audiences' incredulous reactions to her. Impressed by her talents, charisma, image, and maturity, Robinson considered her to be the \"total package\", and took her under his wing.[35][37][39] By this time, Keys had already written two of the songs that she would later include on her debut album, \"Butterflyz\" and \"The Life\".[35][37] Robinson wanted Keys to be informed and prepared for the music industry, so he took her everywhere with him, including all the meetings with attorneys and negotiations with record labels, while the teenager often became disgruntled with the process.[30] Robinson had urged Keys to pursue a solo career, as she remained reluctant, preferring the musical interactions of a group. She took Robinson's advice after her group disbanded, and contacted Robinson who in 1995 introduced her to A&R executive Peter Edge. Edge later described his first impressions of Keys to HitQuarters: I remember that I felt, upon meeting her, that she was completely unique. I had never met a young R&B artist with that level of musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only to be part of hip-hop, but also to go way beyond that. She's a very accomplished musician, songwriter and vocalist and a rare and unique talent.[40] Robinson and Edge helped Keys assemble some demos of songs she had written and set up a showcases for label executives.[14][30][32] Keys performed on the piano for executives of various labels, and a bidding war ensued.[13][32] Edge was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company, Warner Bros. Records, to work at Clive Davis' Arista Records.[13][30][40] During this period, Columbia Records had approached Keys for a record deal, offering her a $26,000 white baby grand piano; after negotiations with her and her manager, she signed to the label, at age 15. Keys was also finishing high school, and her academic success had provided her opportunity for scholarship and early admission to university.[13][30][40] That year, Keys accepted a scholarship to study at Columbia University in Manhattan.[14] She graduated high school early as valedictorian, at the age of 16, and began attending Columbia University at that age while working on her music.[13][35] Keys attempted to manage a difficult schedule between university and working in the studio into the morning, compounding stress and a distant relationship with her mother. She often stayed away from home, and wrote some of the most \"depressing\" poems of her life during this period. Keys decided to drop out of college after a month to pursue music full-time.[14][27][35] Columbia Records had recruited a team of songwriters, producers and stylists to work on Keys and her music. They wanted Keys to submit to their creative and image decisions.[14] Keys said they were not receptive to her contributions and being a musician and music creator.[35][36] While Keys worked on her songs, Columbia executives attempted to change her material; they wanted her to sing and have others create the music, forcing big-name producers on her who demanded she also write with people with whom she was not comfortable.[3][31] She would go into sessions already prepared with music she had composed, but the label would dismiss her work in favor of their vision.[36] \"It was a constant battle, it was a lot of -isms\", Keys recalled. \"There was the sexism, but it was more the ageism \u2013 you're too young, how could you possibly know what you want to do? \u2013 and oh God, that just irked me to death, I hated that.\"[14] \"The music coming out was very disappointing\", she recalled. \"You have this desire to have something good, and you have thoughts and ideas, but when you finish the music it's shit, and it keeps on going like that.\"[32] Keys would be in \"perpetual music industry purgatory\" under Columbia, while they ultimately \"relegated [her] to the shelf\".[37] She had performed \"Little Drummer Girl\" for So So Def's Christmas compilation in 1996,[37] and later co-wrote the song \"Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)\" for the Men in Black (1997) film soundtrack, the only released recording Keys made with Columbia.[27][31] Keys \"hated\" the experience of writing with the people Columbia brought in. \"I remember driving to the studio one day with dread in my chest\", she recalled.[13] Keys said the producers would also sexually proposition her.[3][18][35] \"It's all over the place. And it's crazy. And it's very difficult to understand and handle\", she said.[35] Keys had already built a \"protect yourself\" mentality from growing up in Hell's Kitchen, which served her as a young teen then in the industry having to rebuff the advances of producers and being around people who \"just wanted to use [her]\".[18][29] Keys felt like she could not show weakness.[18] Executives at Columbia also wanted to manufacture her image, with her \"hair blown out and flowing\", short dresses, and asking her to lose weight; \"they wanted me to be the same as everyone else\", Keys felt.[13] \"I had horrible experiences,\" she recalled. \"They were so disrespectful...I started figuring, 'Hey, nothing's worth all this.'\"[3] As months passed, Keys had grown more frustrated and depressed with the situation, while the label requested the finished tracks.[13][32][35] Keys recalled, \"it was around that time that I realized that I couldn't do it with other people. I had to do it more with myself, with the people that I felt comfortable with or by myself with my piano.\"[35] Keys decided to sit in with some producers and engineers to ask questions and watch them technically work on other artists' music.[32] \"The only way it would sound like anything I would be remotely proud of is if I did it\", Keys determined. \"I already knew my way around the keyboard, so that was an advantage. And the rest was watching people work on other artists and watching how they layer things\".[32] Her friend Kerry Brothers Jr. suggested to Keys she buy her own equipment and record on her own.[35] Keys began working separately from the label, exploring more production and engineering on her own with her own equipment.[32] She had moved out of her mother's apartment and into a sixth-floor walk-up apartment in Harlem, where she fit a recording studio into her bedroom and worked on her music.[35] Keys felt being on her own was \"necessary\" for her sanity. She was \"going through a lot\" with herself and with her mother, and she \"needed the space\"; \"I needed to have my own thoughts, to do my own thing.\"[32] Keys later moved to Queens and turned the basement into KrucialKeys Studios with Brothers.[35] Keys would return to her mother's house periodically, particularly when she felt \"lost or unbalanced or alone\". \"She would probably be working and I would sit at the piano\", she reminisced.[35] During this time, she composed the song \"Troubles\", which started as \"a conversation with God\", working on it further in Harlem. Around this time the album \"started coming together\", and she composed and recorded most of the songs that would appear on her album.[25][32][35] \"Finally, I knew how to structure my feelings into something that made sense, something that can translate to people\", Keys recalled. \"That was a changing point. My confidence was up, way up.\"[32] The different experience reinvigorated Keys and her music.[35] While the album was nearly completed, Columbia's management changed and more creative differences emerged with the new executives. Keys brought her songs to the executives, who rejected her work, saying it \"sounded like one long demo\". They wanted Keys to sing over loops,[32] and told Keys they will bring in a \"top\" team and get her \"a more radio-friendly sound\". Keys would not allow it; \"they already had set the monster loose\", she recalled. \"Once I started producing my own stuff there wasn't any going back.\"[35] Keys stated that Columbia had the \"wrong vision\" for her. \"They didn't want me to be an individual, didn't really care\", Keys concluded. \"They just wanted to put me in a box.\"[3] Control over her creative process was \"everything\" to Keys.[36] Keys had wanted to leave Columbia since they began \"completely disrespecting [her] musical creativity\".[13] Leaving Columbia was \"a hell of a fight\", she recalled. \"Out of spite, they were threatening to keep everything I'd created even though they hated it. I thought I'd have to start over again just to get out, but I didn't care.\"[13] Keys said in 2001: \"It's been one trial, one test of confidence and faith after the next.\" To Keys, \"success doesn't just mean that I'm the singer, and you give me my 14 points, and that's all. That's not how it's going to go down.\"[41] Edge, who was by that time head of A&R at Arista Records,[14] said, \"I didn't see that there was much hands-on development at Columbia, and she was smart enough to figure that out and to ask to be released from her contract, which was a bold move for a new artist.\"[35] Edge introduced Keys to Arista's then-president, Clive Davis, in 1998.[14][42] Davis recalled: My only familiarity with [Keys] was that I had asked for any visuals and material on her, so, of course, I was blown away. I saw a panel show she had done on TV. I had heard some cuts she had been recording, and I honestly couldn't believe she could be free. She was still under contract. I left that to her. It took a few months before I got the call that she was able to get out of her contract and enter into one with us.\"[30] After hearing some of her songs, Davis thought Keys had \"a very natural talent as a songwriter and a vocalist, sufficient to warrant a personal meeting...one of those no-brainers \u2013 her beauty is stunning, and all her talent as an arranger, a producer\".[14] Regarding her first meeting with Davis, Keys said that she had \"never had anyone of his stature ask me how I saw myself, and what I wanted to do.\"[13] Davis had asked Keys \"what the creative visions were that she had for herself.\"[30] She came across then, from that very first meeting, the way she comes across today, which is really as a young Renaissance woman of enormous musical talent, but really matured way beyond her young years. When I saw her sit down and play the piano and sing, it just took my breath...Everything about her was unique and special.[30] Robinson and Keys, with Davis' help, were able to negotiate out of the Columbia contract and she signed to Arista Records in late 1998.[31][35][40] Keys was also able to leave with the music she had created.[13] Davis gave Keys the creative freedom and control she wanted, and encouraged her to be herself.[3][42] Keys said of Davis' instinct: \"he knows which artists are the ones that maybe are needing to craft their own sound and style and songs, and you just have to let an artist go and find that space. And I think he somehow knew that and saw that in me and really just let me find that.\"[37] After signing with Davis, Keys continued honing her songs.[3] Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name at the age of 16 until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. She felt that name embodied her both as a performer and person.[43] Keys contributed her songs \"Rock wit U\" and \"Rear View Mirror\" to the soundtracks of the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively.[44][45] In 2000, Davis was ousted from Arista and the release of Keys' album was put on hold. Later that year, Davis formed J Records and immediately signed Keys to the label.[13] \"He didn't try to divert me to something else\", Keys said on following Davis to his new label. He understood that she wants to be herself and not \"made into what somebody else thinks I should be.\"[27] Keys played small shows across America, performed at industry showcases for months and then on television.[32][42] Davis thought \"pop station might feel she's too urban. Urban might feel she's too traditional\", and as he felt Keys was a \"compelling, hypnotic performer\" best experienced in person, he had Keys perform her music to different crowds in different places to spread the word.[30][32][42] \"I created opportunities for those who saw her to spread the word\", Davis recalled. \"She is her own ambassador.\"[30] Davis wanted to \"let people discover her, and you can only do that with a few artists.\"[14][38] Keys later performed on The Tonight Show in promotion for her upcoming debut.[32] Davis wrote a letter to Oprah asking her to have Keys, Jill Scott, and India.Arie perform on her show to promote new women in music.[32] Oprah booked Keys the day she heard her song \"Fallin'\", her debut single.[3][30] Keys performed the song on Oprah's show the week prior to the release of her debut album.[37] \"Fallin'\", released as a single in April, went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and stayed atop the chart for six consecutive weeks.[37][46] Ebony magazine wrote that at the time \"the music that was pumping on the airwaves was hip-hop and rap \u2013 not Alicia's unique blend of classical meets soul, meets hip-hop, meets, well, Alicia. What could have been a recipe for disaster...turned into the opportunity of a lifetime.\"[30] Keys as an artist since her early days, Davis said, \"does her own thing. She has set out her own vision. That's the way it is for artists of her ilk...They don't try to fit in. They try to establish their own paths...[she has] sure natural instinct and sure vision\" and \"a respect for musical history.\"[14][30] Songs in A Minor, which included material that Columbia Records had rejected, was released on June 5, 2001,[35][37] to critical acclaim.[49][50][51] Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&B, soul and jazz-fused album.[52] Jam! described the music as \"old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals\".[53] USA Today wrote that Keys \"taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk\".[54] Songs in A Minor would be \"lauded for its mix of traditional soul values and city-girl coolness\", wrote The Guardian.[25] PopMatters wrote that \"Keys's Songs in A Minor is a testament to her desire (and patience) to create a project that most reflects her sensibilities as a 20-year-old woman and as a musical, cultural, and racial hybrid.\"[38] Songs in A Minor debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number one, selling 236,000 in its first week at retail.[12][37] On its second week, word of mouth and exposure from television performances was so significant that record stores requested another 450,000 copies.[32] The album went on to sell over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 12 million internationally.[55][56] It was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[57][58] Songs in A Minor established Keys' popularity both inside and outside of the United States where she became the best-selling new artist and R&B artist of the year.[37][59] The album's second single, \"A Woman's Worth\", was released in February 2002 and peaked at seven on the Hot 100 and number three on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; becoming her second top ten single on both charts.[60] Released in June, \"How Come You Don't Call Me\", Keys' cover of Prince's song, served as the album's third single, peaking at 59 on the Hot 100. The album's fourth single \"Girlfriend\" was released in the United Kingdom where it peaked at 82. The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.[citation needed] Songs in A Minor received six Grammy Award nominations, including Record of the Year for \"Fallin'\". At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Keys won five Grammys Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song for \"Fallin'\", Best New Artist, and Best R&B Album.[61] Keys tied Lauryn Hill's record for the most Grammy wins for a female solo artist in a year.[13][62] That year, Keys wrote and produced the song \"Impossible\" for Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2002), also providing background vocals and piano.[63][64] During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.[65] Keys followed up her debut with The Diary of Alicia Keys, which was released in December 2003. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 618,000 copies its first week of release, becoming the largest first-week sales for a female artist in 2003.[66] It sold 4.4\u00a0million copies in the United States and was certified four times Platinum by the RIAA.[57][67] It sold eight million copies worldwide,[68] becoming the sixth-biggest-selling album by a female artist and the second-biggest-selling album by a female R&B artist.[69] The album's lead single, \"You Don't Know My Name\", peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for eight consecutive weeks, her first Top 10 single in both charts since 2002's \"A Woman's Worth\". The album's second single, \"If I Ain't Got You\", was released in February 2004 and peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for six weeks. The album's third single, \"Diary\", peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, being their third consecutive Top 10 single in both charts. The album's fourth and final single, \"Karma\", which peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 17 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, first release to fail to achieve top ten status on both charts. \"If I Ain't Got You\" became the first single by a female artist to remain on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for over a year.[70][71][72][73][74] Keys also collaborated with recording artist Usher on the song \"My Boo\" from his 2004 album, Confessions (Special Edition).

Not only was she mean on the ivories, but she showed true musicianship, writing and performing her material\", and Keys continued developing her artistry with subsequent albums.[240] Rolling Stone remarked that Keys broke into the music world as a singer \"with hip-hop swagger, an old-school soul sound and older school (as in Chopin) piano chops\", her appeal \"bridging the generation gap\".[241] On MSN's list of \"Contemporary R&B, hip hop and rap icons\", it was stated that Keys achieved prominence by \"drawing from her classical technique as a pianist, enhanced by her ease as a multi-instrumentalist...and songwriting steeped in her formal studies.\"[234] Keys is also distinguished for being in control of her artistic output and image and having fought for creative independence since getting signed at 15 years old.[244] PopMatters called Keys an artist who \"clearly has a fine sense of her creative talents and has struggled to make sure they are represented in the best way.\"[38] Rolling Stone wrote that, with her classical training, Keys \"reintroduced the idea of a self-reliant (but still pop-friendly) R&B singer-songwriter \u2013 a type that stretches back to Stevie Wonder\", crossing generational lines in the process.[245] Blender magazine expressed that Keys emerged as a \"singer-songwriter-instrumentalist-producer with genuine urban swagger\", and her largely self-produced second album showcased her growing \"deftness and explorative verve\".[246] In 2016, NPR stated that Keys \"stood apart from pop trends while forging a remarkable career\" and \"sustained her focus on artistry\".[36] MOBO described Keys as an accomplished pianist, singer, songwriter and producer who \"has made a consistent and indelible contribution\" to the music industry, her \"unique approach\" making classical music more accessible and \"diffusing barriers between traditional and contemporary\" while \"keeping musical excellence at the core of her art\".[247] In 2003, The Guardian wrote that Keys' largely self-created work is an \"indication of how much power she wields\", and described her as \"an uncompromising artist\" who \"bears little resemblance\" to contemporary stars.[12] Keys has been praised for her expressive vocals and emotive delivery. In a review of Songs in A Minor, Jam! complimented her \"crooning\" and \"warm\" vocals as well as her belting \"gospel-style\".[232] CMJ New Music Monthly commended her \"deep soulful voice and heartfelt delivery\" of her songs.[248] Q magazine compared her vocal talent to Mary J Blige's and acknowledged her \"sincerity\" as \"another plus\" to her musical instincts.[249] PopMatters noted her \"deep purple vocals\" and considered that Keys is \"less concerned about technical proficiency\" and more interested in \"rendering musical moments as authentic and visceral as possible\".[38] The Guardian wrote that Keys \"sings with devastating allure\".[3] Reviewing a live performance, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Keys has a \"commanding voice\" and the \"style and vision to convey the character and detail of the songs\", and praised \"the range and taste of her musical instincts\".[42] NPR described her voice as \"yearning and ready to break, even as it remains in control\", considering it one of the elements integral to her music.[36] Rolling Stone wrote that her \"dynamic\" vocal tone extends \"from a soft croon to a raspy, full-throated roar\".[250] Keys has a three octave contralto vocal range.[247][251] Keys has cited several artists as her inspirations, including Whitney Houston, John Lennon, Sade, Aretha Franklin, Bob Marley, Carole King, Prince, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye, Quincy Jones, Donny Hathaway, Curtis Mayfield, Barbra Streisand, and Stevie Wonder.[255] An accomplished classical pianist, Keys incorporates piano into a majority of her songs.[3][35] Keys was described by New York Daily News as \"one of the most versatile musicians of her generation\".[70] Keys' music is influenced by vintage soul music rooted in gospel,[256] while she heavily incorporates classical piano with R&B, jazz, blues and hip hop into her music.[257] The Guardian noted that Keys is skilled at fusing the \"ruff hip-hop rhythms she absorbed during her New York youth\" into her \"heartfelt, soulful R&B stylings\".[3] The Songwriters Hall of Fame stated that Keys broke onto the music scene with \"her unmistakable blend of soul, hip-hop, jazz and classical music\".[258] She began experimenting with other genres, including pop and rock, in her third studio album, As I Am,[256][259][260] transitioning from neo soul to a 1980s and 1990s R&B sound with her fourth album, The Element of Freedom.[261][262] In 2005, The Independent described her musical style as consisting of \"crawling blues coupled with a hip-hop backbeat, and soul melodies enhanced with her raw vocals\".[263] The New York Daily News stated that her incorporation of classical piano riffs contributed to her breakout success.[70] Jet magazine stated she \"thrives\" by touching fans with \"piano mastery, words and melodious voice\".[264] In 2002, The New York Times wrote that on stage Keys \"invariably starts with a little Beethoven\" and \"moves into rhythm-and-blues that's accessorized with hip-hop scratching, jazz scat-singing and glimmers of gospel.\"[35] Keys's debut album, PopMatters wrote, reflects her sensibilities as young woman and as a \"musical, cultural, and racial hybrid.\"[38] NPR stated in 2016 that Keys' overall work consists of notable \"diversity to style and form\".[36] Salon wrote that the diversity of Keys' music is \"representative of her own border-breaking background and also emblematic of the variety responsible for the excitement and energy of American culture.\"[265] Keys' lyrical content has included themes of love, heartbreak, female empowerment, hope, her philosophy of life and struggles, inner city life experiences, and social and political commentary.[3][12][21][38][237][265][266] John Pareles of The New York Times noted that Keys presents herself as a musician first, and lyrically, her songs \"plunge into the unsettled domain of female identity in the hip-hop era, determined to work their way through conflicting imperatives\", while she plays multiple roles in her songs, expressing loyalty, jealousy, rejection, sadness, desire, fear, uncertainty, and tenacity.[35] Pareles considered in 2007 that Keys did not \"offer private details in her songs\" and that her musical compositions make up for a lack of lyrical refinement.[256][259] Gregory Stephen Tate of The Village Voice compared Keys' writing and production to 1970s music.[267] NPR described a few foundational elements in Key's music: \"heartache or infatuation\", a \"tenderness and emotion made heavy with wisdom\", a \"patiently unfurling melody\", and her \"yearning\" voice.[36] In 2016, referencing her sixth album, Here, Salon noted a \"hypnotic tension\" in Keys' lyrical expression and complimented her \"sense of rhythmic timing\" and socio-political consciousness.[265] Keys has been referred to as the \"Queen of R&B\" by various media outlets.[273] Time has listed her in its list of 100 most influential people twice. Journalist Christopher John Farley wrote: \"Her musicianship raises her above her peers. She doesn't have to sample music's past like a DJ scratching his way through a record collection; she has the chops to examine it, take it apart and create something new and personal with what she has found\" in 2005.[274] In 2017, Kerry Washington also wrote \"Songs in A Minor infused the landscape of hip-hop with a classical sensibility and unfolded the complexity of being young, gifted, female and black for a new generation. Alicia became an avatar for millions of people, always remaining true to herself\" in 2017.[275] Rolling Stone named Songs in A Minor as one of the \"100 Greatest Albums\",[276] and its single \"Fallin'\" in their \"100 greatest songs\" of the 2000s decade.[277] VH1 have listed Keys in their \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\",[278] 14th on \"100 Greatest Women\",[279] and 33rd on \"50 Greatest Women of the Video Era\" lists.[280] Considered a music icon,[284] Keys was placed at number 27 on Billboard's \"35 Greatest R&B Artists of All Time\" list in 2015.[285] The BET Honors honored Keys for her contributions to music with the Entertainment Award in 2008.[286] In 2009, ASCAP honored Keys with its Golden Note Award, presented \"to songwriters, composers, and artists who have achieved extraordinary career milestones.\"[287][288] ASCAP President Paul Williams stated: \"Since joining the ASCAP family at the age of 17, Alicia has grown into one of the most highly recognized and influential songwriter/performers of the past decade, whose artistry puts her in league with many of her musical idols\".[287] In 2011, Keys was honored at the Gala celebration of the 40th anniversary of Woodie King Jr.'s New Federal Theatre, as one of \"13 individuals that changed the cultural life of our nation\", including Sidney Poitier, Ntozake Shange, Ruby Dee, David Dinkins, and Malcolm Boyd.[289][290] In 2015, The Recording Academy honored Keys in Washington D.C., with the Recording Artists' Coalition Award for \"her artistry, philanthropy and her passion for creators' rights as a founding member of the Academy's brand-new GRAMMY Creators Alliance\".[291] In 2018, she was honored by The Recording Academy's Producers & Engineers Wing for her \"outstanding artistic contributions\" and accomplishments.[292] The Recording Academy stated: Keys exemplifies versatility, making her mark in the music world as a singer/songwriter and producer, as well as an actress, author, activist, and philanthropist. [...] her impact on music and culture reaches far beyond sales tallies. The New York native's message of female empowerment and her authentic songwriting process have made her an inspiration for women and aspiring creatives worldwide.[293] In 2018, The National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) honored Keys with the Songwriter Icon award for her \"credits as a music creator\" and her \"role as an inspirational figure to millions\". NMPA president David Israelite wrote about Keys: \"She's a songwriter icon, but she is also an icon of confidence and encouragement to all. Through her writing, performing, philanthropy, mentoring and advocacy for fair compensation for her fellow songwriters, she is a true force for good in our industry and beyond\".[294] Rolling Stone wrote that Keys was \"something new\" in contemporary popular music, \"bridging the generation gap\" with \"hip-hop swagger, an old-school soul sound and older school (as in Chopin) piano chops.\"[241] Key's debut, Billboard stated, \"introduced a different kind of pop singer. Not only was she mean on the ivories, but she showed true musicianship, writing and performing her material\".[240] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone wrote that Keys \"reintroduced the idea of a self-reliant (but still pop-friendly) R&B singer-songwriter \u2013 a type that stretches back to Stevie Wonder\", crossing generational lines in the process.[245] On MSN's list of \"Contemporary R&B, hip hop and rap icons\", it was stated that Keys \"set a high bar\" from the outset of her career, \"drawing from her classical technique as a pianist, enhanced by her ease as a multi-instrumentalist...and songwriting steeped in her formal studies.\"[234] AllMusic wrote that her debut \"kicked off a wave of ambitious new neo-soul songsters\" and \"fit neatly into the movement of ambitious yet classicist new female singer/songwriters that ranged from the worldbeat-inflected pop of Nelly Furtado to the jazzy Norah Jones, whose success may not have been possible if Keys hadn't laid the groundwork\".[295] Keys transcends genres, The Recording Academy also stated, incorporating her \"classical background into her music and including gospel, jazz, blues and vintage soul, rock, and pop influences\", and she is \"one of the most respected musicians of today.\"[281] Jet said that in 2001, Keys \"ushered in a marriage between classical and soul music.\"[27] BBC's Babita Sharma stated in 2016 that Keys has had a significant impact \"on the R&B-soul-jazz sound of the last two decades\".[243] MOBO described Keys as an accomplished pianist, singer, songwriter and producer who is \"responsible for the emergence of vintage R&B imbibed with a post-modernist twist where genres divinely melt\" and \"has made a consistent and indelible contribution\" to the music industry, her \"unique approach\" making classical music more accessible and \"diffusing barriers between traditional and contemporary\".[247] ASCAP stated that Keys' \"innovative and enduring contributions to rhythm & soul music have earned her an Extraordinary Place in American Popular Music.\"[288] Keys has been credited with inspiring and influencing many artists,[37][296] including a younger generation of artists like Adele,[297] Bruno Mars,[298] Rihanna,[299][300] Janelle Mon\u00e1e,[301] Emeli Sand\u00e9,[302] H.E.R.,[303] Jessie Ware,[304][305] James Bay,[306] Ella Mai,[307]

the 2000s decade,[325] and placed her at number 10 in their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years.[326] Keys was the best-selling new artist and best-selling R&B artist of 2001.[59]

also amongst the list of best-selling singles worldwide.[331][332] Keys is one of three female artists included on Billboard magazine's list of the \"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters, 2000\u20132011\" for

co-founder and Global Ambassador of Keep a Child Alive, a non-profit organization that provides medicine, orphan care, and social support to families with HIV and AIDS in Africa and India.[339][340] Keys was born during a time when the AIDS epidemic was gaining a lot of attention in the United States. She was first affected by the HIV/AIDs crisis at 8 years old when her mother's friend died from the disease. She discovered first-hand the extensive impact of the AIDS epidemic years later on a visit to South Africa, a trip that was the impetus to cofounding Keep a Child Alive. Keys had befriended AIDS activist Leigh Blake, who had reached out to her and helped raise her awareness to the global impact of HIV/AIDS. Keys and Leigh visited South African clinics with HIV-infected mothers and children, where Keys encountered the lack of resources and education on the disease present in the communities.[341] Keys visited other African countries such as Uganda and Kenya to promote care for children affected by AIDS.[342][343][344] Her work in Africa was recorded in the documentary Alicia in Africa: Journey to the Motherland which was released in April 2008.[345] Keys hosts and is the musical director of Keep A Child Alive's annual fundraising gala called the Black Ball.[288][346][347] Every year, artists and other celebrities come together to support and perform to raise funds for the cause.[347][348][349] The Black Ball has featured performances from an array of artists including David Bowie, Bono, Pattie Smith, Annie Lennox, Mary J. Blige, Jay-Z, John Mayer, Beyonce, Adele, Justin Timberlake, Carole King, and Roy Ayers.[352] Activists and philanthropists have also been honored at the Black Ball, including Oprah, former President Bill Clinton, Clive Davis, Youssou N'Dour, Sir Richard Branson, and Bono.[348][353] According to Keys, the Black Ball held in 2014 raised around 2.4\u00a0million dollars.[341] Keys and U2 lead singer Bono recorded a cover version of Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush's \"Don't Give Up\" to raise funds for Keep a Child Alive. Their version of the song was retitled \"Don't Give Up (Africa)\" to reflect the nature of the charity it was benefiting.[354][355] In 2005, Keys performed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as part of the worldwide Live 8 concerts to raise awareness of the poverty in Africa and to pressure the G8 leaders to take action.[356] In November 2006, Keys joined David Bowie for what would turn out to be his final live performance at a fundraising event in New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, where they sang a three-song set which included \"Changes\".[357][358] In June 2011, Keys spoke alongside musician Annie Lennox at the United Nations AIDS conference in New York. She participated in a panel titled \"HIV Priorities for Positive Change: In Women's Words\", in which she calls on supporting organizations that provide treatment and care for families affected by AIDS.[359] Empowering the next generation of women, she says, would greatly aid in the end to the disease.[360] Keys performed Donny Hathaway's 1973 song \"Someday We'll All Be Free\" at the America: A Tribute to Heroes televised benefit concert following the September 11 attacks.[361] Keys protested at the New York City Hall against proposed budget cuts for students' education in June 2002.[362] Keys has also donated to Frum tha Ground Up, a non-profit organization that aids children and teenagers with scholarships.[363][364] In 2005, Keys performed on ReAct Now: Music & Relief and Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast, two benefit programs that raised money for those affected by Hurricane Katrina.[365][366] In July 2007, Keys and Keith Urban performed The Rolling Stones' 1969 song \"Gimme Shelter\" at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey at the American leg of the Live Earth concerts.[367][368] She participated in the Nobel Peace Prize Concert which took place at the Oslo Spektrum in Oslo, Norway, on December 11, 2007, along with other artists.[369] She recorded a theme song for Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.

It also provided much-needed employment opportunities to the community.[379] In 2011, the Producer's Guild of America honored Keys at its \"Digital 25: Leaders in Emerging Entertainment\" awards, which recognizes \"individuals or teams who have made exceptional contributions to the advancement of digital entertainment and storytelling.\" She was awarded for her work with her foundation Keep A Child Alive.[380] In 2014, Keys was honored by Unite 4 Humanity with the Music Visionary Award for \"her work as an activist and Founder of Keep A Child Alive\".[381] In 2017, Keys received and shared the award for the Ambassador of Conscience from Amnesty International alongside Canadian Indigenous rights activists. The award is bestowed on activists \"who have stood up to injustice, inspired others and furthered the cause of human rights\", showing \"exceptional leadership and courage in championing human rights\". Amnesty said that Keys \"has used her career and platform as a 15-time Grammy award-winning artist to inspire and campaign for change ... [and] has increasingly interwoven her activism with her art.[382][383] Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International, stated: Both Alicia Keys and the Indigenous rights movement of Canada have in their own ways made inspirational and meaningful contributions to advancing human rights and towards ensuring brighter possibilities for future generations. Crucially, they remind us never to underestimate how far passion and creativity can take us in fighting injustice.[383] In 2018, Keys was honored at Variety's Power of Women luncheon for her work with Keep A Child Alive.[384][385] Keys and her husband, Kasseem Dean (professionally known as Swizz Beatz) are also avid art collectors.

A classically-trained pianist, Keys was composing songs by age 12 and was signed at 15 years old by Columbia Records. After disputes with the label, she signed with Arista Records, and later released her debut album, Songs in A Minor, with J Records in 2001. The album was critically and commercially successful, producing her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"Fallin'\" and selling over 16 million copies worldwide. The album earned Keys five Grammy Awards in 2002. Her second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys (2003), was also a critical and commercial success, spawning successful singles \"You Don't Know My Name\", \"If I Ain't Got You\", and \"Diary\", and selling eight million copies worldwide.[1] The album garnered her an additional four Grammy Awards.[2] Her duet \"My Boo\" with Usher became her second number-one single in 2004. Keys released her first live album, Unplugged (2005), and became the first woman to have an MTV Unplugged album debut at number one.\nHer third album, As I Am (2007), produced the Hot 100 number-one single \"No One\", selling 7 million copies worldwide and earning an additional three Grammy Awards. In 2007, Keys made her film debut in the action-thriller film Smokin' Aces. She, along with Jack White, recorded \"Another Way to Die\" (the title song to the 22nd official James Bond film, Quantum of Solace). Her fourth album, The Element of Freedom (2009), became her first chart-topping album in the UK, and sold 4 million copies worldwide. In 2009, Keys also collaborated with Jay Z on \"Empire State of Mind\", which became her fourth number-one single and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Girl on Fire (2012) was her fifth Billboard 200 topping album, spawning the successful title track, and won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album. In 2013, VH1 Storytellers was released as her second live album. Her sixth studio album, Here (2016), became her seventh US R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart topping album.\nKeys has received numerous accolades in her career, including 15 competitive Grammy Awards, 17 NAACP Image Awards, 12 ASCAP Awards, and an award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and National Music Publishers Association. She has sold over 65 million records worldwide. Considered a musical icon, Keys was named by Billboard the top R&amp;B artist of the 2000s decade and placed number 10 on their list of Top 50 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years. VH1 also included her on their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 100 Greatest Women in Music lists, while Time has named her in their 100 list of most influential people in 2005 and 2017. Keys is also acclaimed for her humanitarian work, philanthropy and activism. She co-founded and is the Global Ambassador of the nonprofit HIV/AIDS-fighting organization Keep a Child Alive.\nAlicia Augello Cook was born on January 25, 1981, in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City's Manhattan borough.[3][4] She is the only child of Teresa (Augello), who was a paralegal and part-time actress, and one of three children of Craig Cook, who was a flight attendant.[5][6][7] Keys' father is African American of Jamaican descent and her mother is of Italian descent; her maternal grandparents came from Sciacca in Sicily.[8] Keys states she also has some Scottish or Irish ancestry.[9] Named after her Puerto Rican godmother,[10] Keys expressed that she was comfortable with her multiracial heritage because she felt she was able to \"relate to different cultures\".[3][11] Keys' father left when she was two and she was subsequently raised by her mother during her formative years in Hell's Kitchen.[12] Keys said her parents never had a relationship, and her father was not in her life.[13] Although she did not like to speak about her father in order to not feed stereotypes, Keys remarked in 2001: \"I'm not in contact with him. That's fine. When I was younger, I minded about that. [It] made me angry. But it helped show me what a strong woman my mother was, and made me want to be strong like her. Probably, it was better for me this way.\"[3] Keys and her mother lived in a one-room apartment.[12] Her mother often worked three jobs to provide for Keys, who \"learned how to survive\" from her mother's example of tenacity and self-reliance.[12][14]\n\u2014Keys[14][15]\nFrom a young age, Alicia struggled with self-esteem issues, \"hiding\" little by little when her differences made her vulnerable to judgement, and later uninvited sexual attention.[16][17][18] Living in the rough neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen,[12][13] she was, from an early age, regularly exposed to street violence, drugs, prostitution, and subjected to sexual propositions in the sex trade- and crime-riddled area.[18][19][20] \"I saw a variety of people growing up, and lifestyles, lows and highs. I think it makes you realise right away what you want and what you don't want\", Keys said.[21] Keys recalled feeling fearful early on of the \"animal instinct\" she witnessed, and eventually feeling \"high\" due to recurrent harassment.[16][22] Her experiences in the streets had led her to carry a homemade knife for protection.[23][24] She became very wary,[24][25] emotionally guarded, and she began wearing gender-neutral clothing and what would become her trademark cornrows.[28] Keys explained that she is grateful for growing up where she did as it prepared her for the parallels in the music industry, particularly as she was a teenager starting out; she could maintain a particular focus and not derail herself.[18][29] She credits her \"tough\" mother for anchoring her on a right path as opposed to many people she knew who ended up on the wrong path and in jail. Keys attributed her unusual maturity as a young girl to her mother, who depended on her to be responsible while she worked to provide for them and give Keys as many opportunities as possible.[24][25]\nKeys loved music and singing from early childhood. She recalled her mother playing jazz records of artists like Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong on Sunday mornings, early musical moments Keys considers influential in kindling her interest in and emotional connection to music.[3][14] In preschool, Keys sung in her school's production of the musical Cats and was cast as Dorothy Gale in a production of The Wizard of Oz.[30] Keys discovered she had a passion for the piano by age six, as she loved the sound and feel of the instrument and desired to play and learn it.[15][31] A friend had given her an old, upright piano, a pivotal gift for Keys as it allowed her to play and take lessons as a child.[13] Keys began receiving classical piano training by age seven,[32] practicing six hours a day,[31] learning the Suzuki method and playing composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, and Satie.[13][33] She was particularly drawn to \"blue, dark, shadowy\" and melancholic compositions, as well as the passionate romanticism of \"blue composers\" like Chopin.[34] Inspired by the film Philadelphia, Keys wrote her first song about her departed grandfather on her piano by age 12. The scene in the film where Tom Hanks's character listens to opera on a record player notably affected Keys, who \"never showed emotion very well\".[15] After seeing the film, Keys, \"for the first time, could express how [she] felt through the music.\"[13][31]\n\u2014Keys[15]\nKeys' mother had encouraged her to participate in different extracurricular activities, including music, dance, theater, and gymnastics, so she could \"find her muse\".[30][35] Her extracurricular activities gave her focus and drive, and helped keep her out of trouble.[23][31][33] Keys remained so occupied with her various pursuits that she experienced her first burnout before adolescence. Before her 13th birthday, she expressed to her mother that she was too overwhelmed and wanted to disengage, at which point her mother took some time off with her and encouraged her to keep focusing on piano.[30] Keys would continue studying classical music until the age of 18.[31] Keys regards her education in classical piano and dedication to classical music as vital for her stability in her youth and her development as a musician and songwriter.[3][15] Keys later said of her classical background:\nThat type of studying, that type of discipline...after a while, I realized what it provided me \u2013 focus, the ability to pay attention for a long enough period of time to make progress; the work ethic; the actual knowledge of music, that then unlocked the ability to write my own music, put my own chords and things I heard in my own head to different lyrics that I maybe felt, and I never, ever had to wait for anybody to write something for me.[36]\nKeys enrolled in the Professional Performing Arts School at the age of 12, where she took music, dance, and theater classes and majored in choir.[5][18] In her preteen years, Keys and her bass-playing friend formed their first group, though neither \"knew too much about how pop songs worked\".[13][33] Keys would continue singing, writing songs, and performing in musical groups throughout junior high and high school.[14][30][32] She became an accomplished pianist, and after her classical music teacher had nothing left to teach her, she began studying jazz at age 14.[35][37] Living in the \"musical melting pot\" city, Keys had already been discovering other genres of music, including soul music, hip hop, R&amp;B, and taken affinity to artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield. Keen on dissecting music, Keys continued developing her songwriting and finding her own 'flow and style\" through her exploration of the intricacies in different music.[15][33][38]\nKeys spent more time in Harlem during her teenage years. She connected with the cultural and racial diversity in the neighborhood, where she expanded upon her musical exploration, and her character was also solidified. \"Harlem raised me in a lot of ways,\" Keys remarked. \"[It] taught me how to think fast, how to play the game...taught me leadership, how to get out of bad situations when you need to, how to hold my own.\"[3][32] During this period, she met her friend and future collaborator Kerry Brothers Jr.[14][32]\nIn 1994, manager Jeff Robinson met 13-year old Keys, who participated in his brother's youth organization called Teens in Motion.[30][39] Robinson's brother had been giving Keys vocal lessons in Harlem.[31] His brother had talked to him about Keys and advised him to go see her, but Robinson shrugged it off as he had \"heard that story 1,000 times\". At the time, Keys was part of a three-girl band that had formed in the Bronx and was performing in Harlem.[30][37] Robinson eventually agreed to his brother's request, and went to see Keys perform with her group at the Police Athletic League center in Harlem. He was soon taken by Keys, her soulful singing, playing contemporary and classical music and performing her own songs.[30][32] Robinson was excited by audiences' incredulous reactions to her. Impressed by her talents, charisma, image, and maturity, Robinson considered her to be the \"total package\", and took her under his wing.[35][37][39] By this time, Keys had already written two of the songs that she would later include on her debut album, \"Butterflyz\" and \"The Life\".[35][37]\nRobinson wanted Keys to be informed and prepared for the music industry, so he took her everywhere with him, including all the meetings with attorneys and negotiations with record labels, while the teenager often became disgruntled with the process.[30] Robinson had urged Keys to pursue a solo career, as she remained reluctant, preferring the musical interactions of a group. She took Robinson's advice after her group disbanded, and contacted Robinson who in 1995 introduced her to A&amp;R executive Peter Edge. Edge later described his first impressions of Keys to HitQuarters:\nI remember that I felt, upon meeting her, that she was completely unique. I had never met a young R&amp;B artist with that level of musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only to be part of hip-hop, but also to go way beyond that. She's a very accomplished musician, songwriter and vocalist and a rare and unique talent.[40]\nRobinson and Edge helped Keys assemble some demos of songs she had written and set up a showcases for label executives.[14][30][32] Keys performed on the piano for executives of various labels, and a bidding war ensued.[13][32] Edge was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company, Warner Bros. Records, to work at Clive Davis' Arista Records.[13][30][40] During this period, Columbia Records had approached Keys for a record deal, offering her a $26,000 white baby grand piano; after negotiations with her and her manager, she signed to the label, at age 15. Keys was also finishing high school, and her academic success had provided her opportunity for scholarship and early admission to university.[13][30][40] That year, Keys accepted a scholarship to study at Columbia University in Manhattan.[14] She graduated high school early as valedictorian, at the age of 16, and began attending Columbia University at that age while working on her music.[13][35] Keys attempted to manage a difficult schedule between university and working in the studio into the morning, compounding stress and a distant relationship with her mother. She often stayed away from home, and wrote some of the most \"depressing\" poems of her life during this period. Keys decided to drop out of college after a month to pursue music full-time.[14][27][35]\nColumbia Records had recruited a team of songwriters, producers and stylists to work on Keys and her music. They wanted Keys to submit to their creative and image decisions.[14] Keys said they were not receptive to her contributions and being a musician and music creator.[35][36] While Keys worked on her songs, Columbia executives attempted to change her material; they wanted her to sing and have others create the music, forcing big-name producers on her who demanded she also write with people with whom she was not comfortable.[3][31] She would go into sessions already prepared with music she had composed, but the label would dismiss her work in favor of their vision.[36] \"It was a constant battle, it was a lot of -isms\", Keys recalled. \"There was the sexism, but it was more the ageism \u2013 you're too young, how could you possibly know what you want to do? \u2013 and oh God, that just irked me to death, I hated that.\"[14] \"The music coming out was very disappointing\", she recalled. \"You have this desire to have something good, and you have thoughts and ideas, but when you finish the music it's shit, and it keeps on going like that.\"[32] Keys would be in \"perpetual music industry purgatory\" under Columbia, while they ultimately \"relegated [her] to the shelf\".[37] She had performed \"Little Drummer Girl\" for So So Def's Christmas compilation in 1996,[37] and later co-wrote the song \"Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)\" for the Men in Black (1997) film soundtrack, the only released recording Keys made with Columbia.[27][31]\nKeys \"hated\" the experience of writing with the people Columbia brought in. \"I remember driving to the studio one day with dread in my chest\", she recalled.[13] Keys said the producers would also sexually proposition her.[3][18][35] \"It's all over the place. And it's crazy. And it's very difficult to understand and handle\", she said.[35] Keys had already built a \"protect yourself\" mentality from growing up in Hell's Kitchen, which served her as a young teen then in the industry having to rebuff the advances of producers and being around people who \"just wanted to use [her]\".[18][29] Keys felt like she could not show weakness.[18] Executives at Columbia also wanted to manufacture her image, with her \"hair blown out and flowing\", short dresses, and asking her to lose weight; \"they wanted me to be the same as everyone else\", Keys felt.[13] \"I had horrible experiences,\" she recalled. \"They were so disrespectful...I started figuring, 'Hey, nothing's worth all this.'\"[3] As months passed, Keys had grown more frustrated and depressed with the situation, while the label requested the finished tracks.[13][32][35] Keys recalled, \"it was around that time that I realized that I couldn't do it with other people. I had to do it more with myself, with the people that I felt comfortable with or by myself with my piano.\"[35] Keys decided to sit in with some producers and engineers to ask questions and watch them technically work on other artists' music.[32] \"The only way it would sound like anything I would be remotely proud of is if I did it\", Keys determined. \"I already knew my way around the keyboard, so that was an advantage. And the rest was watching people work on other artists and watching how they layer things\".[32]\nHer friend Kerry Brothers Jr. suggested to Keys she buy her own equipment and record on her own.[35] Keys began working separately from the label, exploring more production and engineering on her own with her own equipment.[32] She had moved out of her mother's apartment and into a sixth-floor walk-up apartment in Harlem, where she fit a recording studio into her bedroom and worked on her music.[35] Keys felt being on her own was \"necessary\" for her sanity. She was \"going through a lot\" with herself and with her mother, and she \"needed the space\"; \"I needed to have my own thoughts, to do my own thing.\"[32] Keys later moved to Queens and turned the basement into KrucialKeys Studios with Brothers.[35] Keys would return to her mother's house periodically, particularly when she felt \"lost or unbalanced or alone\". \"She would probably be working and I would sit at the piano\", she reminisced.[35] During this time, she composed the song \"Troubles\", which started as \"a conversation with God\", working on it further in Harlem. Around this time the album \"started coming together\", and she composed and recorded most of the songs that would appear on her album.[25][32][35] \"Finally, I knew how to structure my feelings into something that made sense, something that can translate to people\", Keys recalled. \"That was a changing point. My confidence was up, way up.\"[32] The different experience reinvigorated Keys and her music.[35] While the album was nearly completed, Columbia's management changed and more creative differences emerged with the new executives. Keys brought her songs to the executives, who rejected her work, saying it \"sounded like one long demo\". They wanted Keys to sing over loops,[32] and told Keys they will bring in a \"top\" team and get her \"a more radio-friendly sound\". Keys would not allow it; \"they already had set the monster loose\", she recalled. \"Once I started producing my own stuff there wasn't any going back.\"[35] Keys stated that Columbia had the \"wrong vision\" for her. \"They didn't want me to be an individual, didn't really care\", Keys concluded. \"They just wanted to put me in a box.\"[3] Control over her creative process was \"everything\" to Keys.[36]\nKeys had wanted to leave Columbia since they began \"completely disrespecting [her] musical creativity\".[13] Leaving Columbia was \"a hell of a fight\", she recalled. \"Out of spite, they were threatening to keep everything I'd created even though they hated it. I thought I'd have to start over again just to get out, but I didn't care.\"[13] Keys said in 2001: \"It's been one trial, one test of confidence and faith after the next.\" To Keys, \"success doesn't just mean that I'm the singer, and you give me my 14 points, and that's all. That's not how it's going to go down.\"[41] Edge, who was by that time head of A&amp;R at Arista Records,[14] said, \"I didn't see that there was much hands-on development at Columbia, and she was smart enough to figure that out and to ask to be released from her contract, which was a bold move for a new artist.\"[35] Edge introduced Keys to Arista's then-president, Clive Davis, in 1998.[14][42] Davis recalled: \nMy only familiarity with [Keys] was that I had asked for any visuals and material on her, so, of course, I was blown away. I saw a panel show she had done on TV. I had heard some cuts she had been recording, and I honestly couldn't believe she could be free. She was still under contract. I left that to her. It took a few months before I got the call that she was able to get out of her contract and enter into one with us.\"[30]\nAfter hearing some of her songs, Davis thought Keys had \"a very natural talent as a songwriter and a vocalist, sufficient to warrant a personal meeting...one of those no-brainers \u2013 her beauty is stunning, and all her talent as an arranger, a producer\".[14] Regarding her first meeting with Davis, Keys said that she had \"never had anyone of his stature ask me how I saw myself, and what I wanted to do.\"[13] Davis had asked Keys \"what the creative visions were that she had for herself.\"[30]\nShe came across then, from that very first meeting, the way she comes across today, which is really as a young Renaissance woman of enormous musical talent, but really matured way beyond her young years. When I saw her sit down and play the piano and sing, it just took my breath...Everything about her was unique and special.[30]\nRobinson and Keys, with Davis' help, were able to negotiate out of the Columbia contract and she signed to Arista Records in late 1998.[31][35][40] Keys was also able to leave with the music she had created.[13] Davis gave Keys the creative freedom and control she wanted, and encouraged her to be herself.[3][42] Keys said of Davis' instinct: \"he knows which artists are the ones that maybe are needing to craft their own sound and style and songs, and you just have to let an artist go and find that space. And I think he somehow knew that and saw that in me and really just let me find that.\"[37] After signing with Davis, Keys continued honing her songs.[3] Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name at the age of 16 until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. She felt that name embodied her both as a performer and person.[43] Keys contributed her songs \"Rock wit U\" and \"Rear View Mirror\" to the soundtracks of the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively.[44][45]\nIn 2000, Davis was ousted from Arista and the release of Keys' album was put on hold. Later that year, Davis formed J Records and immediately signed Keys to the label.[13] \"He didn't try to divert me to something else\", Keys said on following Davis to his new label. He understood that she wants to be herself and not \"made into what somebody else thinks I should be.\"[27]\nKeys played small shows across America, performed at industry showcases for months and then on television.[32][42] Davis thought \"pop station might feel she's too urban. Urban might feel she's too traditional\", and as he felt Keys was a \"compelling, hypnotic performer\" best experienced in person, he had Keys perform her music to different crowds in different places to spread the word.[30][32][42] \"I created opportunities for those who saw her to spread the word\", Davis recalled. \"She is her own ambassador.\"[30] Davis wanted to \"let people discover her, and you can only do that with a few artists.\"[14][38] Keys later performed on The Tonight Show in promotion for her upcoming debut.[32] Davis wrote a letter to Oprah asking her to have Keys, Jill Scott, and India.Arie perform on her show to promote new women in music.[32] Oprah booked Keys the day she heard her song \"Fallin'\", her debut single.[3][30] Keys performed the song on Oprah's show the week prior to the release of her debut album.[37] \"Fallin'\", released as a single in April, went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and stayed atop the chart for six consecutive weeks.[37][46] Ebony magazine wrote that at the time \"the music that was pumping on the airwaves was hip-hop and rap \u2013 not Alicia's unique blend of classical meets soul, meets hip-hop, meets, well, Alicia. What could have been a recipe for disaster...turned into the opportunity of a lifetime.\"[30] Keys as an artist since her early days, Davis said, \"does her own thing. She has set out her own vision. That's the way it is for artists of her ilk...They don't try to fit in. They try to establish their own paths...[she has] sure natural instinct and sure vision\" and \"a respect for musical history.\"[14][30]\nSongs in A Minor, which included material that Columbia Records had rejected, was released on June 5, 2001,[35][37] to critical acclaim.[49][50][51] Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&amp;B, soul and jazz-fused album.[52] Jam! described the music as \"old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals\".[53] USA Today wrote that Keys \"taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk\".[54] Songs in A Minor would be \"lauded for its mix of traditional soul values and city-girl coolness\", wrote The Guardian.[25] PopMatters wrote that \"Keys's Songs in A Minor is a testament to her desire (and patience) to create a project that most reflects her sensibilities as a 20-year-old woman and as a musical, cultural, and racial hybrid.\"[38]\nSongs in A Minor debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number one, selling 236,000 in its first week at retail.[12][37] On its second week, word of mouth and exposure from television performances was so significant that record stores requested another 450,000 copies.[32] The album went on to sell over 6.2 million copies in the United States and 12 million internationally.[55][56] It was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[57][58] Songs in A Minor established Keys' popularity both inside and outside of the United States where she became the best-selling new artist and R&amp;B artist of the year.[37][59]\nThe album's second single, \"A Woman's Worth\", was released in February 2002 and peaked at seven on the Hot 100 and number three on Billboard's Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs; becoming her second top ten single on both charts.[60] Released in June, \"How Come You Don't Call Me\", Keys' cover of Prince's song, served as the album's third single, peaking at 59 on the Hot 100. The album's fourth single \"Girlfriend\" was released in the United Kingdom where it peaked at 82. The following year, the album was reissued as Remixed &amp; Unplugged in A Minor, which included eight remixes and seven unplugged versions of the songs from the original.[citation needed]\nSongs in A Minor received six Grammy Award nominations, including Record of the Year for \"Fallin'\". At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Keys won five Grammys Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, and Best R&amp;B Song for \"Fallin'\", Best New Artist, and Best R&amp;B Album.[61] Keys tied Lauryn Hill's record for the most Grammy wins for a female solo artist in a year.[13][62] That year, Keys wrote and produced the song \"Impossible\" for Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2002), also providing background vocals and piano.[63][64] During the early 2000s, Keys also made small cameos in television series Charmed and American Dreams.[65]\nKeys followed up her debut with The Diary of Alicia Keys, which was released in December 2003. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 618,000 copies its first week of release, becoming the largest first-week sales for a female artist in 2003.[66] It sold 4.4\u00a0million copies in the United States and was certified four times Platinum by the RIAA.[57][67] It sold eight million copies worldwide,[68] becoming the sixth-biggest-selling album by a female artist and the second-biggest-selling album by a female R&amp;B artist.[69] The album's lead single, \"You Don't Know My Name\", peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for eight consecutive weeks, her first Top 10 single in both charts since 2002's \"A Woman's Worth\". The album's second single, \"If I Ain't Got You\", was released in February 2004 and peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs for six weeks. The album's third single, \"Diary\", peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, being their third consecutive Top 10 single in both charts. The album's fourth and final single, \"Karma\", which peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 17 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, first release to fail to achieve top ten status on both charts. \"If I Ain't Got You\" became the first single by a female artist to remain on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for over a year.[70][71][72][73][74] Keys also collaborated with recording artist Usher on the song \"My Boo\" from his 2004 album, Confessions (Special Edition). The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs for three weeks, became her first number-one single on the Hot 100 since 2001's \"Fallin'\".\nKeys won Best R&amp;B Video for \"If I Ain't Got You\" at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards; she performed the song and \"Higher Ground\" with Lenny Kravitz and Stevie Wonder.[75][76] Later that year, Keys released her novel Tears for Water: Songbook of Poems and Lyrics, a collection of unreleased poems from her journals and lyrics. The title derived from one of her poems, \"Love and Chains\" from the line: \"I don't mind drinking my tears for water.\"[77] She said the title is the foundation of her writing because \"everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question\".[78] The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys made The New York Times bestseller list in 2005.[21][79] The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&amp;B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video \"Karma\".[80] Keys performed \"If I Ain't Got You\" and then joined Jamie Foxx and Quincy Jones in a rendition of \"Georgia on My Mind\", the Hoagy Carmichael song made famous by Ray Charles in 1960 at the 2005 Grammy Awards.[81] That evening, she won four Grammy Awards: Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for \"If I Ain't Got You\", Best R&amp;B Song for \"You Don't Know My Name\", Best R&amp;B Album for The Diary of Alicia Keys, and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals\" for \"My Boo\" with Usher.[82]\nKeys performed and taped her installment of the MTV Unplugged series in July 2005 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.[83] During this session, Keys added new arrangements to her original songs and performed a few choice covers.[84] The session was released on CD and DVD in October 2005. Simply titled Unplugged, the album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with 196,000 units sold in its first week of release.[85] The album sold one million copies in the United States, where it was certified Platinum by the RIAA, and two million copies worldwide.[57][65][86] The debut of Keys' Unplugged was the highest for an MTV Unplugged album since Nirvana's 1994 MTV Unplugged in New York and the first Unplugged by a female artist to debut at number one.[59] The album's first single, \"Unbreakable\", peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs.[87] It remained at number one on the Billboard Hot Adult R&amp;B Airplay for 11 weeks.[88] The album's second and final single, \"Every Little Bit Hurts\", was released in January 2006, it failed to enter the U.S. charts.\nKeys opened a recording studio in Long Island, New York, called The Oven Studios, which she co-owns with her production and songwriting partner Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers.[89] The studio was designed by renowned studio architect John Storyk of WSDG, designer of Jimi Hendrix' Electric Lady Studios. Keys and Brothers are the co-founders of KrucialKeys Enterprises, a production and songwriting team who have assisted Keys in creating her albums as well as creating music for other artists.[90]\nIn 2006, Keys won three NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Female Artist and Outstanding Song for \"Unbreakable\".[91] She also received the Starlight Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[92] In October 2006, she played the voice of Mommy Martian in the \"Mission to Mars\" episode of the children's television series The Backyardigans, in which she sang an original song, \"Almost Everything Is Boinga Here\".[93] That same year, Keys nearly suffered a mental breakdown. Her grandmother had died and her family was heavily dependent on her. She felt she needed to \"escape\" and went to Egypt for three weeks. She explained: \"That trip was definitely the most crucial thing I've ever done for myself in my life to date. It was a very difficult time that I was dealing with, and it just came to the point where I really needed to\u2014basically, I just needed to run away, honestly. And I needed to get as far away as possible.\"[94]\nKeys made her film debut in early 2007 in the crime film Smokin' Aces, co-starring as an assassin named Georgia Sykes opposite Ben Affleck and Andy Garc\u00eda. Keys received much praise from her co-stars in the film; Ryan Reynolds called her \"so natural\" and said she would \"blow everybody away.\" Smokin' Aces was a moderate hit at the box office, earning $57,103,895 worldwide during its theatrical run.[95][96] In the same year, Keys earned further praise for her second film, The Nanny Diaries, based on the 2002 novel of the same name, where she co-starred alongside Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans. The Nanny Diaries had a hit moderate performance at the box office, earning only $44,638,886 worldwide during its theatrical run.[97] She also guest starred as herself in the \"One Man Is an Island\" episode of the drama series Cane.[98]\nKeys released her third studio album, As I Am, in November 2007; it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 742,000 copies in its first week.

In a review of Songs in A Minor, Jam! complimented her \"crooning\" and \"warm\" vocals as well as her belting \"gospel-style\".[232] CMJ New Music Monthly commended her \"deep soulful voice and heartfelt delivery\" of her songs.[248] Q magazine compared her vocal talent to Mary J Blige's and acknowledged her \"sincerity\" as \"another plus\" to her musical instincts.[249] PopMatters noted her \"deep purple vocals\" and considered that Keys is \"less concerned about technical proficiency\" and more interested in \"rendering musical moments as authentic and visceral as possible\".[38] The Guardian wrote that Keys \"sings with devastating allure\".[3] Reviewing a live performance, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Keys has a \"commanding voice\" and the \"style and vision to convey the character and detail of the songs\", and praised \"the range and taste of her musical instincts\".[42] NPR described her voice as \"yearning and ready to break, even as it remains in control\", considering it one of the elements integral to her music.[36] Rolling Stone wrote that her \"dynamic\" vocal tone extends \"from a soft croon to a raspy, full-throated roar\".[250] Keys has a three octave contralto vocal range.[247][251]\nKeys has cited several artists as her inspirations, including Whitney Houston, John Lennon, Sade, Aretha Franklin, Bob Marley, Carole King, Prince, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye, Quincy Jones, Donny Hathaway, Curtis Mayfield, Barbra Streisand, and Stevie Wonder.[255] An accomplished classical pianist, Keys incorporates piano into a majority of her songs.[3][35] Keys was described by New York Daily News as \"one of the most versatile musicians of her generation\".[70] Keys' music is influenced by vintage soul music rooted in gospel,[256] while she heavily incorporates classical piano with R&amp;B, jazz, blues and hip hop into her music.[257] The Guardian noted that Keys is skilled at fusing the \"ruff hip-hop rhythms she absorbed during her New York youth\" into her \"heartfelt, soulful R&amp;B stylings\".[3] The Songwriters Hall of Fame stated that Keys broke onto the music scene with \"her unmistakable blend of soul, hip-hop, jazz and classical music\".[258] She began experimenting with other genres, including pop and rock, in her third studio album, As I Am,[256][259][260] transitioning from neo soul to a 1980s and 1990s R&amp;B sound with her fourth album, The Element of Freedom.[261][262] In 2005, The Independent described her musical style as consisting of \"crawling blues coupled with a hip-hop backbeat, and soul melodies enhanced with her raw vocals\".[263]  The New York Daily News stated that her incorporation of classical piano riffs contributed to her breakout success.[70] Jet magazine stated she \"thrives\" by touching fans with \"piano mastery, words and melodious voice\".[264] In 2002, The New York Times wrote that on stage Keys \"invariably starts with a little Beethoven\" and \"moves into rhythm-and-blues that's accessorized with hip-hop scratching, jazz scat-singing and glimmers of gospel.\"[35] Keys's debut album, PopMatters wrote, reflects her sensibilities as young woman and as a \"musical, cultural, and racial hybrid.\"[38] NPR stated in 2016 that Keys' overall work consists of notable \"diversity to style and form\".[36] Salon wrote that the diversity of Keys' music is \"representative of her own border-breaking background and also emblematic of the variety responsible for the excitement and energy of American culture.\"[265]\nKeys' lyrical content has included themes of love, heartbreak, female empowerment, hope, her philosophy of life and struggles, inner city life experiences, and social and political commentary.[3][12][21][38][237][265][266] John Pareles of The New York Times noted that Keys presents herself as a musician first, and lyrically, her songs \"plunge into the unsettled domain of female identity in the hip-hop era, determined to work their way through conflicting imperatives\", while she plays multiple roles in her songs, expressing loyalty, jealousy, rejection, sadness, desire, fear, uncertainty, and tenacity.[35] Pareles considered in 2007 that Keys did not \"offer private details in her songs\" and that her musical compositions make up for a lack of lyrical refinement.[256][259] Gregory Stephen Tate of The Village Voice compared Keys' writing and production to 1970s music.[267] NPR described a few foundational elements in Key's music: \"heartache or infatuation\", a \"tenderness and emotion made heavy with wisdom\", a \"patiently unfurling melody\", and her \"yearning\" voice.[36] In 2016, referencing her sixth album, Here, Salon noted a \"hypnotic tension\" in Keys' lyrical expression and complimented her \"sense of rhythmic timing\" and socio-political consciousness.[265]\nKeys has been referred to as the \"Queen of R&amp;B\" by various media outlets.[273] Time has listed her in its list of 100 most influential people twice. Journalist Christopher John Farley wrote: \"Her musicianship raises her above her peers. She doesn't have to sample music's past like a DJ scratching his way through a record collection; she has the chops to examine it, take it apart and create something new and personal with what she has found\" in 2005.[274] In  2017, Kerry Washington also wrote \"Songs in A Minor infused the landscape of hip-hop with a classical sensibility and unfolded the complexity of being young, gifted, female and black for a new generation. Alicia became an avatar for millions of people, always remaining true to herself\" in 2017.[275] Rolling Stone named Songs in A Minor as one of the \"100 Greatest Albums\",[276] and its single \"Fallin'\" in their \"100 greatest songs\" of the 2000s decade.[277]\nVH1 have listed Keys in their \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\",[278] 14th on \"100 Greatest Women\",[279] and 33rd on \"50 Greatest Women of the Video Era\" lists.[280] Considered a music icon,[284] Keys was placed at number 27 on Billboard's \"35 Greatest R&amp;B Artists of All Time\" list in 2015.[285] The BET Honors honored Keys for her contributions to music with the Entertainment Award in 2008.[286] In 2009, ASCAP honored Keys with its Golden Note Award, presented \"to songwriters, composers, and artists who have achieved extraordinary career milestones.\"[287][288] ASCAP President Paul Williams stated: \"Since joining the ASCAP family at the age of 17, Alicia has grown into one of the most highly recognized and influential songwriter/performers of the past decade, whose artistry puts her in league with many of her musical idols\".[287] In 2011, Keys was honored at the Gala celebration of the 40th anniversary of Woodie King Jr.'s New Federal Theatre, as one of \"13 individuals that changed the cultural life of our nation\", including Sidney Poitier, Ntozake Shange, Ruby Dee, David Dinkins, and Malcolm Boyd.[289][290]\nIn 2015, The Recording Academy honored Keys in Washington D.C., with the Recording Artists' Coalition Award for \"her artistry, philanthropy and her passion for creators' rights as a founding member of the Academy's brand-new GRAMMY Creators Alliance\".[291] In 2018, she was honored by The Recording Academy's Producers &amp; Engineers Wing for her \"outstanding artistic contributions\" and accomplishments.[292] The Recording Academy stated:\nKeys exemplifies versatility, making her mark in the music world as a singer/songwriter and producer, as well as an actress, author, activist, and philanthropist. [...] her impact on music and culture reaches far beyond sales tallies. The New York native's message of female empowerment and her authentic songwriting process have made her an inspiration for women and aspiring creatives worldwide.[293]\nIn 2018, The National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) honored Keys with the Songwriter Icon award for her \"credits as a music creator\" and her \"role as an inspirational figure to millions\". NMPA president David Israelite wrote about Keys: \"She's a songwriter icon, but she is also an icon of confidence and encouragement to all. Through her writing, performing, philanthropy, mentoring and advocacy for fair compensation for her fellow songwriters, she is a true force for good in our industry and beyond\".[294]\nRolling Stone wrote that Keys was \"something new\" in contemporary popular music, \"bridging the generation gap\" with \"hip-hop swagger, an old-school soul sound and older school (as in Chopin) piano chops.\"[241]  Key's debut, Billboard stated, \"introduced a different kind of pop singer. Not only was she mean on the ivories, but she showed true musicianship, writing and performing her material\".[240] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone wrote that Keys \"reintroduced the idea of a self-reliant (but still pop-friendly) R&amp;B singer-songwriter \u2013 a type that stretches back to Stevie Wonder\", crossing generational lines in the process.[245] On MSN's list of \"Contemporary R&amp;B, hip hop and rap icons\", it was stated that Keys \"set a high bar\" from the outset of her career, \"drawing from her classical technique as a pianist, enhanced by her ease as a multi-instrumentalist...and songwriting steeped in her formal studies.\"[234] AllMusic wrote that her debut \"kicked off a wave of ambitious new neo-soul songsters\" and \"fit neatly into the movement of ambitious yet classicist new female singer/songwriters that ranged from the worldbeat-inflected pop of Nelly Furtado to the jazzy Norah Jones, whose success may not have been possible if Keys hadn't laid the groundwork\".[295]\nKeys transcends genres, The Recording Academy also stated, incorporating her \"classical background into her music and including gospel, jazz, blues and vintage soul, rock, and pop influences\", and she is \"one of the most respected musicians of today.\"[281] Jet said that in 2001, Keys \"ushered in a marriage between classical and soul music.\"[27] BBC's Babita Sharma stated in 2016 that Keys has had a significant impact \"on the R&amp;B-soul-jazz sound of the last two decades\".[243] MOBO described Keys as an accomplished pianist, singer, songwriter and producer who is \"responsible for the emergence of vintage R&amp;B imbibed with a post-modernist twist where genres divinely melt\" and \"has made a consistent and indelible contribution\" to the music industry, her \"unique approach\" making classical music more accessible and \"diffusing barriers between traditional and contemporary\".[247] ASCAP stated that Keys' \"innovative and enduring contributions to rhythm &amp; soul music have earned her an Extraordinary Place in American Popular Music.\"[288]\nKeys has been credited with inspiring and influencing many artists,[37][296] including a younger generation of artists like Adele,[297] Bruno Mars,[298] Rihanna,[299][300] Janelle Mon\u00e1e,[301] Emeli Sand\u00e9,[302] H.E.R.,[303] Jessie Ware,[304][305] James Bay,[306] Ella Mai,[307] Wyvern Lingo,[296] Anuhea Jenkins,[308] Jorja Smith,[309][310] Lauren Jauregui,[311][312] Normani,[311] Alessia Cara,[313][314] Ruth-Anne Cunningham,[315] Lianne La Havas,[316][317][318] Heather Russell,[319] Grimes,[320] and Sophie Delila.[321]\nKeys is listed on the Recording Industry Association of America's best-selling artists in the United States, selling over 17.8\u00a0million albums and 21.9\u00a0million digital songs.[322] She has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.[323][324] Billboard ranked Keys as the fifth-most successful artist of the 2000s decade,[132] top R&amp;B artist of the 2000s decade,[325] and placed her at number 10 in their list of Top 50 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years.[326] Keys was the best-selling new artist and best-selling R&amp;B artist of 2001.[59] She has attained 4 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles from 9 top-ten singles.[327] She has also attained 8 Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and Airplay number-one singles,[328][329] and set a Guinness World Record on the former in 2008, when she became the first artist to replace herself at number one with \"No One\" and \"Like You'll Never See Me Again\".[330] \"No One\" and \"Empire State of Mind\" are also amongst the list of best-selling singles worldwide.[331][332] Keys is one of three female artists included on Billboard magazine's list of the \"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters, 2000\u20132011\" for writing songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[333]\nKeys has earned numerous awards including 15 competitive Grammy Awards,[334] 17 NAACP Image Awards, 9 Billboard Music Awards and 7 BET Awards.[335] Keys received 5 Grammy Awards in 2002, becoming the second female artist to win as many in one night.[336] In 2005, Keys was awarded the Songwriters Hall of Fame Hal David Starlight Award, which honors \"gifted songwriters who are at an apex in their careers and are making a significant impact in the music industry via their original songs\".[15][258] That year, ASCAP awarded Keys Songwriter of the Year at its Rhythm &amp;

She was first affected by the HIV/AIDs crisis at 8 years old when her mother's friend died from the disease. She discovered first-hand the extensive impact of the AIDS epidemic years later on a visit to South Africa, a trip that was the impetus to cofounding Keep a Child Alive. Keys had befriended AIDS activist Leigh Blake, who had reached out to her and helped raise her awareness to the global impact of HIV/AIDS. Keys and Leigh visited South African clinics with HIV-infected mothers and children, where Keys encountered the lack of resources and education on the disease present in the communities.[341] Keys visited other African countries such as Uganda and Kenya to promote care for children affected by AIDS.[342][343][344] Her work in Africa was recorded in the documentary Alicia in Africa: Journey to the Motherland which was released in April 2008.[345]\nKeys hosts and is the musical director of Keep A Child Alive's annual fundraising gala called the Black Ball.[288][346][347] Every year, artists and other celebrities come together to support and perform to raise funds for the cause.[347][348][349] The Black Ball has featured performances from an array of artists including David Bowie, Bono, Pattie Smith, Annie Lennox, Mary J.

She participated in a panel titled \"HIV Priorities for Positive Change: In Women's Words\", in which she calls on supporting organizations that provide treatment and care for families affected by AIDS.[359] Empowering the next generation of women, she says, would greatly aid in the end to the disease.[360]\nKeys performed Donny Hathaway's 1973 song \"Someday We'll All Be Free\" at the America: A Tribute to Heroes televised benefit concert following the September 11 attacks.[361] Keys protested at the New York City Hall against proposed budget cuts for students' education in June 2002.[362] Keys has also donated to Frum tha Ground Up, a non-profit organization that aids children and teenagers with scholarships.[363][364] In 2005, Keys performed on ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief and Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast, two benefit programs that raised money for those affected by Hurricane Katrina.[365][366] In July 2007, Keys and Keith Urban performed The Rolling Stones' 1969 song \"Gimme Shelter\" at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey at the American leg of the Live Earth concerts.[367][368]\nShe participated in the Nobel Peace Prize Concert which took place at the Oslo Spektrum in Oslo, Norway, on December 11, 2007, along with other artists.[369] She recorded a theme song for Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.

As of 2019, he is the most recent Republican governor of California. Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15. He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times, remaining a prominent presence in bodybuilding and writing many books and articles on the sport. The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second most important professional bodybuilding event in recent years,[3] is named after him. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, as well as the sport's most charismatic ambassador.[4] Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, a box-office hit that resulted in a sequel.[5] In 1984, he appeared in the title role of James Cameron's critically and commercially successful science fiction action film The Terminator. He subsequently played a similar Terminator character in most of the franchise's later installments, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Genisys (2015),[5][6][7] and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019). He has appeared in a number of other successful films, such as Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Twins (1988), Total Recall (1990), Kindergarten Cop (1990), and True Lies (1994). Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver, a niece of the 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy and daughter of the 1972 Democratic vice presidential candidate and former Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with another woman in 1997;[8] the divorce was finalized in 2017. As a Republican, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He was sworn in on November 17, to serve the remainder of Davis' term. He was then re-elected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor.[9] In 2011, he completed his second term as governor and returned to acting. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed \"the Austrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" or \"Schwarzy\" during his acting career, \"The Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"Terminator\") during his political career, and is commonly known in Japan as \"Shuwa-chan\" (\u30b7\u30e5\u30ef\u3061\u3083\u3093). Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947 in Thal, Styria[10] to Aurelia (n\u00e9e Jadrny; 1922\u20131998) and Gustav Schwarzenegger (1907\u20131972). His father was the local chief of police and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938.[11] He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad,[12] but was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. He married Schwarzenegger's mother on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Arnold Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: \"Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.\"[13] He grew up in a Catholic family who attended Mass every Sunday.[14][15] Gustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.[16] His favoritism was \"strong and blatant\", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.[17] Schwarzenegger has said that his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems.\"[14] He had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death.[18] In later life, he commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Center to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of Gustav being involved in atrocities, despite his membership in the Nazi Party and Sturmabteilung (SA).[16] Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California recall campaign.[19] At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average, but stood out for his \"cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant\" character.[14] Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.[17] As a boy, he played several sports, heavily influenced by his father.[14] He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym.[10] At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career.[5][6] He later said, \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start olympic lifting.\"[13] However, his official website biography claims that \"at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\"[20] During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\"[21] Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen.[13] When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz.[10] He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, so that he could train even when it was closed. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.\"[13] Schwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971.[10] He was driving drunk and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named Patrick. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S.[17] Gustav died on December 13, 1972, from a stroke.[10] In Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film.[22] However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.[23] Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.[17] In an interview with Fortune in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what \"would now be called child abuse\" at the hands of his father: \"My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'\"[11] Schwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.[10][20] During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.[6] He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: \"Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.\" He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted \"best-built man of Europe\", which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. \"The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America\u2014the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.\"[21] Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London.[20] He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton.[20] Charles \"Wag\" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.[24][25] Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: \"Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.\"[26] Also in 1966, while at Bennett's home, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor.[26][27] The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20.[20] He would go on to win the title a further three times.[6] Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, where he attended a business school and worked in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym, where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title.[20] He frequently told Roger C. Field, his English coach and friend in Munich at that time, \"I'm going to become the greatest actor!\"[28] Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the U.S. since the age of 10, and saw bodybuilding as the avenue through which to do so,[29] realized his dream by moving to the United States in October 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English.[6][10] There he trained at Gold's Gym in Venice, Los Angeles, California, under Joe Weider's supervision. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was Ric Drasin, a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973.[30] Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler Superstar Billy Graham. In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first Mr. Olympia title in New York, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.[20] The immigration law firm Siskind & Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an illegal immigrant at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his visa.[31] LA Weekly would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who \"overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s\".[29] In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder became a huge success.[10] In 1977 he posed for the gay magazine After Dark.[32][33] Due to taking an assortment of courses at Santa Monica College in California (including English classes), as well as further upper division classes at the University of California, Los Angeles as part of UCLA's extension program, Schwarzenegger had by then accumulated enough credits so as to be \"within striking distance\" of graduation. In 1979 he enrolled in the University of Wisconsin\u2013Superior as a distance education student, completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior in order to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980, he formally graduated and received his bachelor's degree in business administration and marketing. He got his United States citizenship in 1983.[34] Schwarzenegger said that during this time he encountered a friend who told him he was teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM), which prompted Schwarzenegger to reveal that he had been struggling with anxiety for the first time in his life: \"Even today, I still benefit from [the year of TM] because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem.\"[35] Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,[3] and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows. For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.[37] Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.[37] American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.[37] One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.[10] He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.[10][20] He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4\u00a0\u2013 NABBA [England], 1\u00a0\u2013 IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991. Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.[38] During Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963[39] and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.[36] In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254\u00a0kg / 560\u00a0lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests. Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia.[10][20] His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.[20] He continued his winning streak in the 1971\u201374 competitions.[20] In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,[20] beating Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.[20] Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron. Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges. Although significantly taller and heavier, Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.[10] Schwarzenegger was training for his role in Conan, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory (subject of the documentary \"The Comeback\") was highly controversial, though, as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass (especially in his thighs)[42] and subpar conditioning shouldn't have allowed him to go ahead of a very competitive lineup that year;[3] Mike Mentzer, in particular, felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest.[43][44] Schwarzenegger has acknowledged using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1977 that \"steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up.\"[45] He has called the drugs \"tissue building\".[46] In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his later heart problems. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court.[47] In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with Globe, a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.[48] Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1969's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name \"Arnold Strong\", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production.[6] His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: \"It was very difficult for me in the beginning\u00a0\u2013 I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.\"[13] Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron (1977),[5][6] elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.[52] In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the ABC sitcom The San Pedro Beach Bums and the ABC police procedural The Streets of San Francisco. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of The Incredible Hulk, but did not win the role because of his height. Later, Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy The Villain. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress Jayne Mansfield as Mansfield's husband, Mickey Hargitay. Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which was a box-office hit.[5] This was followed by a sequel, Conan the Destroyer, in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.[53] In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, Carnival in Rio. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in James Cameron's science fiction thriller film The Terminator.[5][6][7] Following this, Schwarzenegger made Red Sonja in 1985.[53] During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars.[6] Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), and Red Heat (1988). Twins (1988), a comedy with Danny DeVito, also proved successful. Total Recall (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10\u00a0million (equivalent to $19.6 million today) and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\". Kindergarten Cop (1990) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman, who directed him in Twins. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt, entitled \"The Switch\",[54] and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut.[55] He has not directed since. Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the \"International Star of the Decade\".[10] His next film project, the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero, was released opposite Jurassic Park, and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama True Lies (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron. That same year, the comedy Junior was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller Eraser (1996), the Christmas comedy Jingle All The Way (1996), and the comic book-based Batman & Robin (1997), in which he played the villain Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of Batman & Robin, his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller End of Days (1999), later followed by the action films The 6th Day (2000) and Collateral Damage (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which went on to earn over $150\u00a0million domestically (equivalent to $208 million today).[56] In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter-tall (80\u00a0ft) Terminator statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics.[57] His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in The Rundown, and the 2004 remake of Around the World in 80 Days. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film The Kid & I. He voiced Baron von Steuben in the Liberty's Kids episode \"Valley Forge\". He had been rumored to be appearing in Terminator Salvation as the original T-800; he denied his involvement,[58] but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first Terminator movie.[59][60] Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables, where he made a cameo appearance. In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama With Wings as Eagles, written by Randall Wallace, based on a true story.[61][62] On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the Arnold Classic, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to The Terminator and remakes of Predator and The Running Man, and that he was \"packaging\" a comic book character.[63] The character was later revealed to be the Governator, star of the comic book and animated series of the same name. Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with Stan Lee, who would have produced the series. Schwarzenegger would have voiced the Governator.[64][65][66][67] On May 20, 2011, Schwarzenegger's entertainment counsel announced that all movie projects currently in development were being halted: \"Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines.\"[68] On July 11, 2011, it was announced that Schwarzenegger was considering a comeback film, despite the legal problems related to his divorce.[69] He appeared in The Expendables 2 (2012),[70] and starred in The Last Stand (2013), his first leading role in 10 years, and Escape Plan (2013), his first co-starring role alongside Sylvester Stallone. He starred in Sabotage, released in March 2014, and appeared in The Expendables 3, released in August 2014. He starred in the fifth Terminator movie Terminator Genisys in 2015[71] and would reprise his role as Conan the Barbarian in The Legend of Conan,[72][73] later renamed Conan the Conqueror.[74] However, in April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there was a possibility of a TV show. The story of the film was supposed to be set 30 years after the first, with some inspiration from Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.[75] In August 2016, his filming of action-comedy Why We're Killing Gunther was temporarily interrupted by bank robbers near filming location in Surrey, British Columbia.[76] He was announced to star and produce in a film about the ruins of Sanxingdui called The Guest of Sanxingdui, as an ambassador.[77] On February 6, 2018, Amazon Studios announced they were working with Schwarzenegger to develop a new series entitled Outrider in which he will star and executive produce. The western-drama set in the Oklahoma Indian Territory in the late 1800s will follow a deputy (portrayed by Schwarzenegger) who is tasked with apprehending a legendary outlaw in the wilderness but is forced to partner with a ruthless Federal Marshal to make sure justice is properly served. The series will also mark as Schwarzenegger's first major scripted TV role.[78] Schwarzenegger returned to the Terminator franchise with Terminator: Dark Fate, which was released on November 1, 2019. It was produced by the series' co-creator James Cameron, who directed him previously in the first two films in the series and in True Lies.[79][80] It was shot in Almer\u00eda, Hungary and the US.[81] In September 2015, the media announced that Schwarzenegger was to replace Donald Trump as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice.[82] This show, the 15th season of The Apprentice, aired during the 2016\u20132017 TV season. In the show, he used the phrases \"you're terminated\" and \"get to the choppa\", which are quotes from some of his famous roles (The Terminator and Predator, respectively), when firing the contestants.[83][84] In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. Schwarzenegger had reacted to Trump's most recent remarks in January 2017 via an Instagram clip: \"Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV because you're such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.\"[85]Schwarzenegger has been a registered Republican for many years. When he was an actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a liberal and Democratic-leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained he was a Republican because the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.[86] I finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The presidential campaign was in full swing. I remember watching the Nixon\u2013Humphrey presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left. But then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, \"What party is he?\" My friend said, \"He's a Republican.\" I said, \"Then I am a Republican.\" And I have been a Republican ever since. In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in \"Stop the Madness\", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 presidential election, accompanying then-Vice President George H. W. Bush at a campaign rally.[87] Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993.[10] He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him \"Conan the Republican\". He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson. Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio public service announcements to donate blood. In an interview with Talk magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, \"I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside.\" The Hollywood Reporter claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, \"I'm in show business\u00a0\u2013 I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?\"[88] Arnold Schwarzenegger is a moderate Republican.[89] He says he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal.[90] On the issue of abortion, he describes himself as pro-choice, but supports parental notification for minors and a ban on partial-birth abortion.[91] He has supported gay rights, such as domestic partnerships, and he performed a same-sex marriage as Governor.[92] Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003, episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.[6] Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the \"Governator\" (referring to The Terminator movies, see above) and \"The Running Man\" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election \"Total Recall\" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.[93] On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4% of the Yes vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3\u00a0million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862. Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up political gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch \"Hans and Franz\" from Saturday Night Live (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians \"girlie men\".[94] Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that \"no one could win if the opposition raised 160\u00a0million dollars to defeat you\". The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000.[95] Schwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election. Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat Phil Angelides, the California State Treasurer, in the 2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes.[96] Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast, in which Schwarzenegger said, in part \"How wrong I was when I said everyone has an equal opportunity to make it in America [...] the state of California does not provide (equal) education for all of our children\", San Francisco mayor & future governor of California Gavin Newsom said that \"[H]e's becoming a Democrat [... H]e's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left\".[97] Some speculated that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. Such rumors turned out to be false.[98][99] Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as the means to escape a depressing home.[16] Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, \"I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential\u00a0\u2013 I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.\"[16] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, \"I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes.\"[29] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger cannot run for U.S. President as he is not a natural-born citizen of the United States. Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian and United States citizen.[100] He has held Austrian citizenship since birth and U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007 European Voice campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU.[101] Because of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year.[102] Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the Republican primary of the 2008 U.S. presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, \"It's Rudy's fault!\" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.[103] In its April 2010 report, Progressive ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of 11 \"worst governors\" in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor.[104][105] Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intensive campaign[106] against Proposition 66.[107] He stated that \"it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists\".[108] Although he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings (as high as 65% in May 2004),[109] he left office with a record low 23%,[110] only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis, when he was recalled in October 2003. In May 2010, Esteban N\u00fa\u00f1ez pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the death of Louis Santos. N\u00fa\u00f1ez is the son of Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, then California Assembly Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger.[111][112][113][114] As a personal favor to \"a friend\", just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger commuted N\u00fa\u00f1ez's sentence by more than half, to seven years.[113][115][116] Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos' family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.[116] The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated Marsy's Law. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, \"Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state.\" However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor.[111] Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that allows offender's victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days notice for any commutations.[117] N\u00fa\u00f1ez was released from prison after serving less than six years.[118] During his initial campaign for governor in 2003, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger.[119] Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the Los Angeles Times recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories.[120] Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.[119] Schwarzenegger replied in 2004 that he has \"behaved badly sometimes\" and apologized, but also stated that \"a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true\". This led to a resurfacing of an interview in adult magazine Oui from 1977, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as marijuana.[121] Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film Pumping Iron. In an interview with GQ magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, \"[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me.\"[122] His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.[122] British television personality Anna Richardson settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger, his top aide, Sean Walsh, and his publicist, Sheryl Main.[123] A joint statement read: \"The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled.\"[123] Richardson claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that Schwarzenegger touched her breast during a press event for The 6th Day in London.[124] She claimed Walsh and Main libeled her in a Los Angeles Times article when they contended she encouraged his behavior.[123] Schwarzenegger became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 17, 1983.[125] Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship.[126] In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams. Pilz argued that Schwarzenegger caused damage to Austria's reputation in the international community because Austria abolished the death penalty in 1968. Pilz based his argument on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: \"A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.\"[100] Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by pointing out that his only duty as Governor of California with respect to the death penalty was to correct an error by the justice system by pardon or clemency if such an error had occurred. On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, creating the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.[127] Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009.[128] In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.[129] In respect for his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 SAE World Congress in Detroit, on April 20, 2009.[130] In 2011, Schwarzenegger founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action to develop a sustainable, low-carbon economy.[131] The Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment in 2003 was widely accredited as the \"Amend for Arnold\" bill, which would have added an amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run, as he was not a natural born citizen. In 2004, the \"Amend for Arnold\" campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.[132] In June 2007, Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of TIME magazine with Michael Bloomberg, and subsequently, the two joked about a Presidential ticket together.[133] In October 2013, the New York Post reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for president. The former California governor would face a constitutional hurdle; Article II, Section I, Clause V prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible constitutional change, or filing a legal challenge to the provision. Columbia University law professor Michael Dorf observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, \"The law is very clear, but it's not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process.\"[134] Schwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career.[16][29] Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a \"prolific goal setter\" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car\u00a0\u2013 and succeed in doing so.[23] By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of lucrative business ventures and investments. In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.[135][136] Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail-order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.[10][135] Schwarzenegger transferred profits from the mail-order business and his bodybuilding-competition winnings into his first real estate investment venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. He would later go on to invest in a number of real estate holding companies.[137][138] Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe) along with Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Demi Moore. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000.[139][140] Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on \"new US global business ventures\" and his movie career.[139] He also invested in a shopping mall in Columbus, Ohio. He has talked about some of those who have helped him over the years in business: \"I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from Milton Friedman to Donald Trump... and now, Les Wexner and Warren Buffett. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!\"[21] He has significant ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm.[141] Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold's Sports Festival, which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a movie production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint publishing venture with Simon & Schuster.[142] In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in Santa Monica called Schatzi On Main. Schatzi literally means \"little treasure,\" and colloquially \"honey\" or \"darling\" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.[143] Schwarzenegger's net worth had been conservatively estimated at $100 million\u2013$200\u00a0million.[144] After separating from his wife, Maria Shriver, in 2011, it has been estimated that his net worth has been approximately $400 million, and even as high as $800 million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.[145] Over the years, he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings worldwide, making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to economic recessions in the U.S. and Europe since the late 2000s. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38\u00a0million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet.[146] Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, \"Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50\u00a0million, but I was just as happy when I had $48\u00a0million.\"[16] He appears in a series of commercials for the Machine Zone game Mobile Strike as a military commander and spokesman.[147] In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974.[148] Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir, \"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\"[148] Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a \"joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\" but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became \"insufferable\u2014classically conceited\u2014the world revolved around him\".[149] Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak.[150] Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.[150] Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.[150] Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.[150] The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television.[23] They shared an apartment in Santa Monica, California, for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard.[23] Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had \"little understanding of polite society\" and she found him a turn-off, she says, \"He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be\u2014he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.\"[23] Schwarzenegger met his next lover, Beverly Hills hairdresser's assistant Sue Moray, on Venice Beach in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: \"We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.\"[17] Schwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President John F. Kennedy, at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.[17] On April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married Shriver in Hyannis, Massachusetts. The\u00a0Rev.\u00a0John\u00a0Baptist\u00a0Riordan performed the ceremony at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church.[151] They have four children: Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger (born December 13, 1989), Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born July 23, 1991),[152] Patrick Arnold Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 18, 1993),[153] and Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 27, 1997).[154] All of their children were born in Los Angeles.[155] The family lived in a 11,000-square-foot (1,000\u00a0m2) home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California,[156][157] with vacation homes in Sun Valley, Idaho and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.[158] They attended St. Monica's Catholic Church.[159] On May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage, with Shriver moving out of the couple's Brentwood mansion.[160][161][162] On May 16, 2011, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son more than 14 years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia \"Patty\" Baena.[163][164][165] \"After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,\" Schwarzenegger said in a statement issued to The Times. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after she had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child.[166] Baena is of Guatemalan origin. She was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011.[167] The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple's four children.[168] Baena's son with Schwarzenegger, Joseph,[169] was born on October 2, 1997,[170] and Shriver gave birth to Christopher a few days before on September 27, 1997.[171] Schwarzenegger says it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy \"started looking like [him] ... that [he] put things together\".[172] Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child \"from the start and continued to provide support\".[173] KNX 1070 radio reported that in 2010 he bought a new four-bedroom house with a pool for Baena and their son in Bakersfield, California.[174] Baena separated from her husband, Rogelio, a few months after Joseph's birth. She filed for divorce in 2008.[175] Rogelio says that the child's birth certificate was falsified and that he planned to sue Schwarzenegger for engaging in conspiracy to falsify a public document, a serious crime in California.[176] Pursuant to the divorce judgment, Schwarzenegger kept the Brentwood home, while Shriver purchased a new home nearby so that the children could travel between their parents' homes. They shared custody of the two youngest children.[177] Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorney's fees.[72] However, he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them.[72] He filed amended divorce papers remedying this.[72][178] Schwarzenegger and Shriver finalized their divorce in 2017, six years after separating.[179] After the scandal, Danish-Italian actress Brigitte Nielsen came forward and stated that she too had an affair with Schwarzenegger during the production of Red Sonja, while he had just started his relationship with Shriver,[180] saying, \"Maybe I wouldn't have got into it if he said 'I'm going to marry Maria' and this is deadly serious, but he didn't, and our affair carried on.\"[180] When asked in January 2014, \"Of all the things you are famous for ... which are you least proud of?\" Schwarzenegger replied, \"I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up.\"[181] As of July\u00a02015[update], Schwarzenegger was dating physical therapist Heather Milligan, 27 years his junior.[182] Schwarzenegger was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets).[183][184] He opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.[185] On March 29, 2018, Schwarzenegger underwent emergency open-heart surgery.[186] He said about his recovery: \"I underwent open-heart surgery this spring, I had to use a walker. I had to do breathing exercises five times a day to retrain my lungs. I was frustrated and angry, and in my worst moments, I couldn't see the way back to my old self.\"[187] On December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.[188] Schwarzenegger saved a drowning man's life in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.[189] On January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his Harley Davidson motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained a minor injury to his lip, requiring 15 stitches. \"No citations were issued,\" said Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.[190] Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.[191] Schwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho, with his family on December 23, 2006.[192] On December 26, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from St. John's Health Center on December 30, 2006.[193] Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by his press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.[194] On May 18, 2019, while on a visit to South Africa, Schwarzenegger was attacked, drop-kicked from behind by an unknown malefactor, while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools. Despite the surprise and unprovoked nature of the attack, he reportedly suffered no injuries and continued to interact with fans. The attacker was apprehended and Schwarzenegger declined to press charges against him.[195][196][197] Schwarzenegger's official height of 6\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.88\u00a0m) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6\u00a0ft 1.5\u00a0in (1.867\u00a0m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders.[citation needed] However, in 1988, both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter.[198] Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader.[199] As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, \"settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is\" by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor.[200] Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words \"Need a lift?\" on the five-foot-five-inch (1.65\u00a0m) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office.[201] Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (1.78\u00a0m) and that he wore risers in his boots.[202] In 1999, Men's Health magazine stated his height was 5\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (1.78\u00a0m).[203] Schwarzenegger's autobiography, Total Recall, was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called \"The Secret\" to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.[204] Growing up during the Allied occupation of Austria, Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child.[205] As a result, he had to pay $20,000 in order to bring his Austrian Army M47 Patton tank (331) to the United States,[206] which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965. However, he later obtained his vehicle in 1991/2,[207] during his tenure as the Chairmen of the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition,[208] and now uses it to support his charity.[207] His first car ever was an Opel Kadett in 1969 after serving in the Austrian army, then he rode a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy in 1991.[209] Moreover, he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a Humvee. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, AM General, to produce a street-legal, civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two Hummer H1s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for hydrogen, one for vegetable oil, and one for biodiesel.[210] Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse. He was spotted and filmed in 2015 in his car, painted silver with bright aluminum forged wheels. His Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark brown leather.[211] In 2017, Schwarzenegger acquired a Mercedes G-Class modified for all-electric drive.[212] The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large\u2014each weighs 6,300\u00a0lb (2,900\u00a0kg) and is 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) wide\u2014that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a U.S. Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.[213] California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.[214] Schwarzenegger has been involved with the Special Olympics for many years after they were founded by his ex-mother-in-law, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.[215] In 2007, Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics which were held in Shanghai, China.[216] Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them.[217] In 1995, he founded the Inner City Games Foundation (ICG) which provides cultural, educational and community enrichment programming to youth. ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide.[217] He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002.[218] ASAS is an after school program provider, educating youth about health, fitness and nutrition. On February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger took part in the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay. He handed off the flame to the next runner, Sebastian Coe.[219] Schwarzenegger had a collection of Marxist busts, which he requested from Russian friends at the end of the Soviet Union as they were being destroyed. In 2011, he revealed that his wife had requested they be removed, but he kept the one of Vladimir Lenin present, since \"he was the first\".[220] In 2015, he said he kept the Lenin bust to \"show losers\".[221] Schwarzenegger is a lifelong supporter and \"friend of Israel\", and has participated in L.A.'s Pro-Israel rally[222] among other similar events.[223] Schwarzenegger supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[224] Schwarzenegger also expressed support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[225] Schwarzenegger released a video message supporting protests against Ukraine's pro-Russian President Victor Yanukovych.[226] Schwarzenegger, who played football as a boy, grew up watching Bayern Munich and Sturm Graz.[227] He also expressed his admiration of J\u00fcrgen Klopp's Liverpool in October 2019.[227] In 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California.[228] The Institute's mission is to \"[advance] post-partisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve\" and to \"seek to influence public policy and public debate in finding solutions to the serious challenges we face\".[229] Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the Institute.[230] At a 2015 security conference, Arnold Schwarzenegger called climate change the issue of our time.[231] He also urged politicians to stop treating climate change as a political issue.[232] For the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Schwarzenegger endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[233] However, he announced in October that he would not vote for the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in that year's United States presidential election, with this being the first time he did not vote for the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.[234][235][236] In recent years Schwarzenegger has been advocating for eating less meat,[237] and he is an executive producer alongside James Cameron et al. behind the documentary The Game Changers,[238] that documents the explosive rise of plant-based eating in professional sports, in which he is also featured. In 2017, Schwarzenegger condemned white supremacists who were seen carrying Nazi and Confederate flags, by calling their heroes \"losers\".[239] In 2019, while at the \"Arnold Classic Africa\" sports competition as an official, Schwarzenegger was attacked by an assailant in a flying kick. The assailant was arrested.[240]",

The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second most important professional bodybuilding event in recent years,[3] is named after him. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, as well as the sport's most charismatic ambassador.[4]\nSchwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, a box-office hit that resulted in a sequel.[5] In 1984, he appeared in the title role of James Cameron's critically and commercially successful science fiction action film The Terminator. He subsequently played a similar Terminator character in most of the franchise's later installments, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Genisys (2015),[5][6][7] and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019). He has appeared in a number of other successful films, such as Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Twins (1988), Total Recall (1990), Kindergarten Cop (1990), and True Lies (1994). Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver, a niece of the 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy and daughter of the 1972 Democratic vice presidential candidate and former Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with another woman in 1997;[8] the divorce was finalized in 2017.\nAs a Republican, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He was sworn in on November 17, to serve the remainder of Davis' term. He was then re-elected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor.[9] In 2011, he completed his second term as governor and returned to acting. \nSchwarzenegger was nicknamed \"the Austrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" or \"Schwarzy\" during his acting career, \"The Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"Terminator\") during his political career, and is commonly known in Japan as \"Shuwa-chan\" (\u30b7\u30e5\u30ef\u3061\u3083\u3093).\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947 in Thal, Styria[10] to Aurelia (n\u00e9e Jadrny; 1922\u20131998) and Gustav Schwarzenegger (1907\u20131972). His father was the local chief of police and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938.[11] He was wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad,[12] but was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. He married Schwarzenegger's mother on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Arnold Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: \"Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared.\"[13] He grew up in a Catholic family who attended Mass every Sunday.[14][15]\nGustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.[16] His favoritism was \"strong and blatant\", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.[17] Schwarzenegger has said that his father had \"no patience for listening or understanding your problems.\"[14] He had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death.[18] In later life, he commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Center to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of Gustav being involved in atrocities, despite his membership in the Nazi Party and Sturmabteilung (SA).[16] Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California recall campaign.[19]\nAt school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average, but stood out for his \"cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant\" character.[14] Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.[17] As a boy, he played several sports, heavily influenced by his father.[14] He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym.[10] At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career.[5][6] He later said, \"I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start olympic lifting.\"[13] However, his official website biography claims that \"at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career.\"[20] During a speech in 2001, he said, \"My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school.\"[21]\nSchwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen.[13] When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: \"As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve.\" In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz.[10] He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, so that he could train even when it was closed. \"It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it.\" When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: \"I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie.\"[13]\nSchwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971.[10] He was driving drunk and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named Patrick. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S.[17] Gustav died on December 13, 1972, from a stroke.[10] In Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film.[22] However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.[23] Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.[17]\nIn an interview with Fortune in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what \"would now be called child abuse\" at the hands of his father: \"My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'\"[11]\nSchwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.[10][20] During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.[6] He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: \"Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences.\" He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted \"best-built man of Europe\", which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. \"The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America\u2014the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich.\"[21] Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London.[20] He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton.[20]\nCharles \"Wag\" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.[24][25] Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: \"Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.\"[26]\nAlso in 1966, while at Bennett's home, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor.[26][27] The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20.[20] He would go on to win the title a further three times.[6] Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, where he attended a business school and worked in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym, where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title.[20] He frequently told Roger C. Field, his English coach and friend in Munich at that time, \"I'm going to become the greatest actor!\"[28]\nSchwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the U.S. since the age of 10, and saw bodybuilding as the avenue through which to do so,[29] realized his dream by moving to the United States in October 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English.[6][10] There he trained at Gold's Gym in Venice, Los Angeles, California, under Joe Weider's supervision. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was Ric Drasin, a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973.[30] Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler Superstar Billy Graham. In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first Mr. Olympia title in New York, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.[20]\nThe immigration law firm Siskind &amp; Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an illegal immigrant at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his visa.[31] LA Weekly would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who \"overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s\".[29]\nIn 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder became a huge success.[10] In 1977 he posed for the gay magazine After Dark.[32][33] Due to taking an assortment of courses at Santa Monica College in California (including English classes), as well as further upper division classes at the University of California, Los Angeles as part of UCLA's extension program, Schwarzenegger had by then accumulated enough credits so as to be \"within striking distance\" of graduation. In 1979 he enrolled in the University of Wisconsin\u2013Superior as a distance education student, completing most of his coursework by correspondence and flying out to Superior in order to meet professors and take final exams. In May 1980, he formally graduated and received his bachelor's degree in business administration and marketing. He got his United States citizenship in 1983.[34]\nSchwarzenegger said that during this time he encountered a friend who told him he was teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM), which prompted Schwarzenegger to reveal that he had been struggling with anxiety for the first time in his life: \"Even today, I still benefit from [the year of TM] because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem.\"[35]\nSchwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,[3] and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.\nFor many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle &amp; Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.[37] Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.[37] American Media Inc., which owns Muscle &amp; Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.[37]\nOne of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.[10] He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.[10][20] He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4\u00a0\u2013 NABBA [England], 1\u00a0\u2013 IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.\nSchwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.[38]\nDuring Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963[39] and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.[36]\nIn 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254\u00a0kg / 560\u00a0lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.\nSchwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia.[10][20] His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.[20]\nHe continued his winning streak in the 1971\u201374 competitions.[20] In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,[20] beating Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.[20]\nMonths before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron. Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges. Although significantly taller and heavier, Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.\nSchwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.[10] Schwarzenegger was training for his role in Conan, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having been declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory (subject of the documentary \"The Comeback\") was highly controversial, though, as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass (especially in his thighs)[42] and subpar conditioning shouldn't have allowed him to go ahead of a very competitive lineup that year;[3] Mike Mentzer, in particular, felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest.[43][44]\nSchwarzenegger has acknowledged using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1977 that \"steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up.\"[45] He has called the drugs \"tissue building\".[46]\nIn 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his later heart problems. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court.[47] In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with Globe, a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.[48]\nSchwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1969's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name \"Arnold Strong\", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production.[6] His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: \"It was very difficult for me in the beginning\u00a0\u2013 I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance.\"[13]\nSchwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron (1977),[5][6] elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.[52] In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the ABC sitcom The San Pedro Beach Bums and the ABC police procedural The Streets of San Francisco. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of The Incredible Hulk, but did not win the role because of his height. Later, Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy The Villain. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress Jayne Mansfield as Mansfield's husband, Mickey Hargitay.\nSchwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which was a box-office hit.[5] This was followed by a sequel, Conan the Destroyer, in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.[53] In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, Carnival in Rio. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in James Cameron's science fiction thriller film The Terminator.[5][6][7] Following this, Schwarzenegger made Red Sonja in 1985.[53]\nDuring the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars.[6] Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), and Red Heat (1988).\nTwins (1988), a comedy with Danny DeVito, also proved successful. Total Recall (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10\u00a0million (equivalent to $19.6 million today) and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\". Kindergarten Cop (1990) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman, who directed him in Twins. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt, entitled \"The Switch\",[54] and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut.[55] He has not directed since.\nSchwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the \"International Star of the Decade\".[10] His next film project, the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero, was released opposite Jurassic Park, and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama True Lies (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.\nThat same year, the comedy Junior was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller Eraser (1996), the Christmas comedy Jingle All The Way (1996), and the comic book-based Batman &amp; Robin (1997), in which he played the villain Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of Batman &amp; Robin, his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller End of Days (1999), later followed by the action films The 6th Day (2000) and Collateral Damage (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which went on to earn over $150\u00a0million domestically (equivalent to $208 million today).[56]\nIn tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter-tall (80\u00a0ft) Terminator statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics.[57]\nHis film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in The Rundown, and the 2004 remake of Around the World in 80 Days. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film The Kid &amp; I. He voiced Baron von Steuben in the Liberty's Kids episode \"Valley Forge\". He had been rumored to be appearing in Terminator Salvation as the original T-800; he denied his involvement,[58] but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first Terminator movie.[59][60] Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables, where he made a cameo appearance.\nIn January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama With Wings as Eagles, written by Randall Wallace, based on a true story.[61][62]\nOn March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the Arnold Classic, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to The Terminator and remakes of Predator and The Running Man, and that he was \"packaging\" a comic book character.[63] The character was later revealed to be the Governator, star of the comic book and animated series of the same name. Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with Stan Lee, who would have produced the series. Schwarzenegger would have voiced the Governator.[64][65][66][67]\nOn May 20, 2011, Schwarzenegger's entertainment counsel announced that all movie projects currently in development were being halted: \"Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines.\"[68] On July 11, 2011, it was announced that Schwarzenegger was considering a comeback film, despite the legal problems related to his divorce.[69] He appeared in The Expendables 2 (2012),[70] and starred in The Last Stand (2013), his first leading role in 10 years, and Escape Plan (2013), his first co-starring role alongside Sylvester Stallone. He starred in Sabotage, released in March 2014, and appeared in The Expendables 3, released in August 2014. He starred in the fifth Terminator movie Terminator Genisys in 2015[71] and would reprise his role as Conan the Barbarian in The Legend of Conan,[72][73] later renamed Conan the Conqueror.[74] However, in April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there was a possibility of a TV show. The story of the film was supposed to be set 30 years after the first, with some inspiration from Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.[75]\nIn August 2016, his filming of action-comedy Why We're Killing Gunther was temporarily interrupted by bank robbers near filming location in Surrey, British Columbia.[76] He was announced to star and produce in a film about the ruins of Sanxingdui called The Guest of Sanxingdui, as an ambassador.[77]\nOn February 6, 2018, Amazon Studios announced they were working with Schwarzenegger to develop a new series entitled Outrider in which he will star and executive produce. The western-drama set in the Oklahoma Indian Territory in the late 1800s will follow a deputy (portrayed by Schwarzenegger) who is tasked with apprehending a legendary outlaw in the wilderness but is forced to partner with a ruthless Federal Marshal to make sure justice is properly served. The series will also mark as Schwarzenegger's first major scripted TV role.[78]\nSchwarzenegger returned to the Terminator franchise with Terminator: Dark Fate, which was released on November 1, 2019. It was produced by the series' co-creator James Cameron, who directed him previously in the first two films in the series and in True Lies.[79][80] It was shot in Almer\u00eda, Hungary and the US.[81]\nIn September 2015, the media announced that Schwarzenegger was to replace Donald Trump as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice.[82] This show, the 15th season of The Apprentice, aired during the 2016\u20132017 TV season. In the show, he used the phrases \"you're terminated\" and \"get to the choppa\", which are quotes from some of his famous roles (The Terminator and Predator, respectively), when firing the contestants.[83][84]\n\n\nIn March 2017, following repeated criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. Schwarzenegger had reacted to Trump's most recent remarks in January 2017 via an Instagram clip: \"Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV because you're such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.\"[85]Schwarzenegger has been a registered Republican for many years. When he was an  actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a liberal and Democratic-leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained he was a Republican because the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.[86]\nI finally arrived here in 1968. What a special day it was. I remember I arrived here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of determination, full of desire. The presidential campaign was in full swing. I remember watching the Nixon\u2013Humphrey presidential race on TV. A friend of mine who spoke German and English translated for me. I heard Humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which I had just left.\nBut then I heard Nixon speak. He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air. I said to my friend, I said, \"What party is he?\" My friend said, \"He's a Republican.\" I said, \"Then I am a Republican.\" And I have been a Republican ever since.\nIn 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in \"Stop the Madness\", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 presidential election, accompanying then-Vice President George H. W. Bush at a campaign rally.[87]\nSchwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993.[10] He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him \"Conan the Republican\". He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson.\nBetween 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio public service announcements to donate blood.\nIn an interview with Talk magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, \"I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside.\" The Hollywood Reporter claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, \"I'm in show business\u00a0\u2013 I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?\"[88]\nArnold Schwarzenegger is a moderate Republican.[89] He says he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal.[90] On the issue of abortion, he describes himself as pro-choice, but supports  parental notification for minors and a ban on partial-birth abortion.[91] He has supported gay rights, such as domestic partnerships, and he performed a same-sex marriage as Governor.[92]\nSchwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003, episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.[6] Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the \"Governator\" (referring to The Terminator movies, see above) and \"The Running Man\" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election \"Total Recall\" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.[93]\nOn October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4% of the Yes vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3\u00a0million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862.\nSchwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up political gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch \"Hans and Franz\" from Saturday Night Live (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians \"girlie men\".[94]\nSchwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses from being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that \"no one could win if the opposition raised 160\u00a0million dollars to defeat you\".  The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000.[95]\nSchwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.\nSchwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat Phil Angelides, the California State Treasurer, in the 2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes.[96] Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast, in which Schwarzenegger said, in part \"How wrong I was when I said everyone has an equal opportunity to make it in America [...] the state of California does not provide (equal) education for all of our children\", San Francisco mayor &amp; future governor of California Gavin Newsom said that \"[H]e's becoming a Democrat [... H]e's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left\".[97]\nSome speculated that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. Such rumors turned out to be false.[98][99]\nWendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as the means to escape a depressing home.[16] Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, \"I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential\u00a0\u2013 I was always fascinated by people in control of other people.\"[16] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, \"I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes.\"[29] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.\nSchwarzenegger cannot run for U.S. President as he is not a natural-born citizen of the United States. Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian and United States citizen.[100] He has held Austrian citizenship since birth and U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007 European Voice campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU.[101]\nBecause of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year.[102]\nSchwarzenegger's endorsement in the Republican primary of the 2008 U.S. presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, \"It's Rudy's fault!\" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.[103]\nIn its April 2010 report, Progressive ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of 11 \"worst governors\" in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor.[104][105]\nGovernor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intensive campaign[106] against Proposition 66.[107] He stated that \"it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists\".[108]\nAlthough he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings (as high as 65% in May 2004),[109] he left office with a record low 23%,[110] only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis, when he was recalled in October 2003.\nIn May 2010, Esteban N\u00fa\u00f1ez pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the death of Louis Santos. N\u00fa\u00f1ez is the son of Fabian N\u00fa\u00f1ez, then California Assembly Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger.[111][112][113][114]\nAs a personal favor to \"a friend\", just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger commuted N\u00fa\u00f1ez's sentence by more than half, to seven years.[113][115][116] Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos' family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.[116]\nThe Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated Marsy's Law. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, \"Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state.\" However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor.[111] Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that allows offender's victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days notice for any commutations.[117] N\u00fa\u00f1ez was released from prison after serving less than six years.[118]\nDuring his initial campaign for governor in 2003, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger.[119] Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the Los Angeles Times recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories.[120] Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.[119]\nSchwarzenegger replied in 2004 that he has \"behaved badly sometimes\" and apologized, but also stated that \"a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true\". This led to a resurfacing of an interview in adult magazine Oui from 1977, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as marijuana.[121] Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film Pumping Iron. In an interview with GQ magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, \"[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me.\"[122] His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.[122]\nBritish television personality Anna Richardson settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger, his top aide, Sean Walsh, and his publicist, Sheryl Main.[123] A joint statement read: \"The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled.\"[123] Richardson claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that Schwarzenegger touched her breast during a press event for The 6th Day in London.[124] She claimed Walsh and Main libeled her in a Los Angeles Times article when they contended she encouraged his behavior.[123]\nSchwarzenegger became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 17, 1983.[125] Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship.[126] In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams. Pilz argued that Schwarzenegger caused damage to Austria's reputation in the international community because Austria abolished the death penalty in 1968. Pilz based his argument on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: \"A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.\"[100] Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by pointing out that his only duty as Governor of California with respect to the death penalty was to correct an error by the justice system by pardon or clemency if such an error had occurred.\nOn September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, creating the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.[127]\nSchwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009.[128] In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.[129]\nIn respect for his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 SAE World Congress in Detroit, on April 20, 2009.[130]\nIn 2011, Schwarzenegger founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action to develop a sustainable, low-carbon economy.[131]\nThe Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment in 2003 was widely accredited as the \"Amend for Arnold\" bill, which would have added an amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run, as he was not a natural born citizen. In 2004, the \"Amend for Arnold\" campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.[132]\nIn June 2007, Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of TIME magazine with Michael Bloomberg, and subsequently, the two joked about a Presidential ticket together.[133]\nIn October 2013, the New York Post reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for president. The former California governor would face a constitutional hurdle; Article II, Section I, Clause V prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible constitutional change, or filing a legal challenge to the provision. Columbia University law professor Michael Dorf observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, \"The law is very clear, but it's not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process.\"[134]\nSchwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career.[16][29] Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a \"prolific goal setter\" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car\u00a0\u2013 and succeed in doing so.[23] By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of lucrative business ventures and investments.\nIn 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.[135][136] Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail-order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.[10][135]\nSchwarzenegger transferred profits from the mail-order business and his bodybuilding-competition winnings into his first real estate investment venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. He would later go on to invest in a number of real estate holding companies.[137][138]\nSchwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe) along with Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Demi Moore. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000.[139][140] Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on \"new US global business ventures\" and his movie career.[139]\nHe also invested in a shopping mall in Columbus, Ohio. He has talked about some of those who have helped him over the years in business: \"I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from Milton Friedman to Donald Trump... and now, Les Wexner and Warren Buffett. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!\"[21] He has significant ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm.[141] Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold's Sports Festival, which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a movie production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint publishing venture with Simon &amp; Schuster.[142]\nIn 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in Santa Monica called Schatzi On Main. Schatzi literally means \"little treasure,\" and colloquially \"honey\" or \"darling\" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.[143]\nSchwarzenegger's net worth had been conservatively estimated at $100 million\u2013$200\u00a0million.[144] After separating from his wife, Maria Shriver, in 2011, it has been estimated that his net worth has been approximately $400 million, and even as high as $800 million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.[145]\nOver the years, he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings worldwide, making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to economic recessions in the U.S. and Europe since the late 2000s. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38\u00a0million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet.[146] Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, \"Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50\u00a0million, but I was just as happy when I had $48\u00a0million.\"[16]\nHe appears in a series of commercials for the Machine Zone game Mobile Strike as a military commander and spokesman.[147]\nIn 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974.[148] Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir, \"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\"[148] Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a \"joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\" but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became \"insufferable\u2014classically conceited\u2014the world revolved around him\".[149] Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak.[150] Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.[150]\nBaker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.[150] Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.[150] The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television.[23] They shared an apartment in Santa Monica, California, for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard.[23] Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had \"little understanding of polite society\" and she found him a turn-off, she says, \"He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be\u2014he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me.\"[23]\nSchwarzenegger met his next lover, Beverly Hills hairdresser's assistant Sue Moray, on Venice Beach in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: \"We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted.\"[17] Schwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President John F. Kennedy, at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.[17]\nOn April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married Shriver in Hyannis, Massachusetts. The\u00a0Rev.\u00a0John\u00a0Baptist\u00a0Riordan performed the ceremony at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church.[151] They have four children: Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger (born December 13, 1989), Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born July 23, 1991),[152] Patrick Arnold Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 18, 1993),[153] and Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 27, 1997).[154] All of their children were born in Los Angeles.[155] The family lived in a 11,000-square-foot (1,000\u00a0m2) home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California,[156][157] with vacation homes in Sun Valley, Idaho and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.[158] They attended St. Monica's Catholic Church.[159]\nOn May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage, with Shriver moving out of the couple's Brentwood mansion.[160][161][162] On May 16, 2011, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son more than 14 years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia \"Patty\" Baena.[163][164][165] \"After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,\" Schwarzenegger said in a statement issued to The Times. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after she had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child.[166]\nBaena is of Guatemalan origin. She was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011.[167] The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple's four children.[168] Baena's son with Schwarzenegger, Joseph,[169] was born on October 2, 1997,[170] and Shriver gave birth to Christopher a few days before on September 27, 1997.[171] Schwarzenegger says it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy \"started looking like [him] ... that [he] put things together\".[172] Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child \"from the start and continued to provide support\".[173] KNX 1070 radio reported that in 2010 he bought a new four-bedroom house with a pool for Baena and their son in Bakersfield, California.[174] Baena separated from her husband, Rogelio, a few months after Joseph's birth. She filed for divorce in 2008.[175] Rogelio says that the child's birth certificate was falsified and that he planned to sue Schwarzenegger for engaging in conspiracy to falsify a public document, a serious crime in California.[176]\nPursuant to the divorce judgment, Schwarzenegger kept the Brentwood home, while Shriver purchased a new home nearby so that the children could travel between their parents' homes. They shared custody of the two youngest children.[177] Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorney's fees.[72] However, he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them.[72] He filed amended divorce papers remedying this.[72][178] Schwarzenegger and Shriver finalized their divorce in 2017, six years after separating.[179]\nAfter the scandal, Danish-Italian actress Brigitte Nielsen came forward and stated that she too had an affair with Schwarzenegger during the production of Red Sonja, while he had just started his relationship with Shriver,[180] saying, \"Maybe I wouldn't have got into it if he said 'I'm going to marry Maria' and this is deadly serious, but he didn't, and our affair carried on.\"[180] When asked in January 2014, \"Of all the things you are famous for ... which are you least proud of?\" Schwarzenegger replied, \"I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up.\"[181]\nAs of July\u00a02015[update], Schwarzenegger was dating physical therapist Heather Milligan, 27 years his junior.[182]\nSchwarzenegger was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets).[183][184] He opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.[185] On March 29, 2018, Schwarzenegger underwent emergency open-heart surgery.[186] He said about his recovery: \"I underwent open-heart surgery this spring, I had to use a walker. I had to do breathing exercises five times a day to retrain my lungs. I was frustrated and angry, and in my worst moments, I couldn't see the way back to my old self.\"[187]\nOn December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.[188]\nSchwarzenegger saved a drowning man's life in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.[189]\nOn January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his Harley Davidson motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained a minor injury to his lip, requiring 15 stitches. \"No citations were issued,\" said Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.[190] Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.[191]\nSchwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho, with his family on December 23, 2006.[192] On December 26, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from St. John's Health Center on December 30, 2006.[193]\nSchwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by his press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.[194]\nOn May 18, 2019, while on a visit to South Africa, Schwarzenegger was attacked, drop-kicked from behind by an unknown malefactor, while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools. Despite the surprise and unprovoked nature of the attack, he reportedly suffered no injuries and continued to interact with fans. The attacker was apprehended and Schwarzenegger declined to press charges against him.[195][196][197]\nSchwarzenegger's official height of 6\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.88\u00a0m) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6\u00a0ft 1.5\u00a0in (1.867\u00a0m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders.[citation needed] However, in 1988, both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter.[198] Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader.[199] As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, \"settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is\" by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor.[200] Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words \"Need a lift?\" on the five-foot-five-inch (1.65\u00a0m) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office.[201] Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (1.78\u00a0m) and that he wore risers in his boots.[202] In 1999, Men's Health magazine stated his height was 5\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (1.78\u00a0m).[203]\nSchwarzenegger's autobiography, Total Recall, was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called \"The Secret\" to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.[204]\nGrowing up during the Allied occupation of Austria, Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child.[205] As a result, he had to pay $20,000 in order to bring his Austrian Army M47 Patton tank (331) to the United States,[206] which he previously operated during his mandatory service in 1965. However, he later obtained his vehicle in 1991/2,[207] during his tenure as the Chairmen of the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition,[208] and now uses it to support his charity.[207] His first car ever was an Opel Kadett in 1969 after serving in the Austrian army, then he rode a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy in 1991.[209]\nMoreover, he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a Humvee. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, AM General, to produce a street-legal, civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two Hummer H1s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for hydrogen, one for vegetable oil, and one for biodiesel.[210] Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse. He was spotted and filmed in 2015 in his car, painted silver with bright aluminum forged wheels. His Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark brown leather.[211] In 2017, Schwarzenegger acquired a Mercedes G-Class modified for all-electric drive.[212]\nThe Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large\u2014each weighs 6,300\u00a0lb (2,900\u00a0kg) and is 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) wide\u2014that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a U.S. Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.[213] California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.[214]\nSchwarzenegger has been involved with the Special Olympics for many years after they were founded by his ex-mother-in-law, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.[215] In 2007, Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics which were held in Shanghai, China.[216] Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them.[217] In 1995, he founded the Inner City Games Foundation (ICG) which provides cultural, educational and community enrichment programming to youth. ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide.[217] He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002.[218] ASAS is an after school program provider, educating youth about health, fitness and nutrition.\nOn February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger took part in the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay. He handed off the flame to the next runner, Sebastian Coe.[219]\nSchwarzenegger had a collection of Marxist busts, which he requested from Russian friends at the end of the Soviet Union as they were being destroyed. In 2011, he revealed that his wife had requested they be removed, but he kept the one of Vladimir Lenin present, since \"he was the first\".[220] In 2015, he said he kept the Lenin bust to \"show losers\".[221]\nSchwarzenegger is a lifelong supporter and \"friend of Israel\", and has participated in L.A.'s Pro-Israel rally[222] among other similar events.[223]\nSchwarzenegger supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[224] Schwarzenegger also expressed support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[225] Schwarzenegger released a video message supporting protests against Ukraine's pro-Russian President Victor Yanukovych.[226]\nSchwarzenegger, who played football as a boy, grew up watching Bayern Munich and Sturm Graz.[227] He also expressed his admiration of J\u00fcrgen Klopp's Liverpool in October 2019.[227]\nIn 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California.[228] The Institute's mission is to \"[advance] post-partisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve\" and to \"seek to influence public policy and public debate in finding solutions to the serious challenges we face\".[229] Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the Institute.[230]\nAt a 2015 security conference, Arnold Schwarzenegger called climate change the issue of our time.[231] He also urged politicians to stop treating climate change as a political issue.[232]\nFor the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Schwarzenegger endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[233] However, he announced in October that he would not vote for the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in that year's United States presidential election, with this being the first time he did not vote for the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.[234][235][236]\nIn recent years Schwarzenegger has been advocating for eating less meat,[237] and he is an executive producer alongside James Cameron et al. behind the documentary The Game Changers,[238] that documents the explosive rise of plant-based eating in professional sports, in which he is also featured.\nIn 2017, Schwarzenegger condemned white supremacists who were seen carrying Nazi and Confederate flags, by calling their heroes \"losers\".[239]\nIn 2019, while at the \"Arnold Classic Africa\" sports competition as an official, Schwarzenegger was attacked by an assailant in a flying kick.

                "text": "no title\n\nLena Dunham (/\u02c8li\u02d0n\u0259 \u02c8d\u028cn\u0259m/; born May 13, 1986) is an American actress, writer, director, and producer. She is known as the creator, writer, and star of the HBO television series Girls (2012\u20132017), for which she received several Emmy Award nominations and two Golden Globe Awards.[1][2] Dunham also directed several episodes of Girls and became the first woman to win the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Comedy Series.[3] Prior to Girls, Dunham wrote, directed, and starred in the semi-autobiographical independent film Tiny Furniture (2010), for which she won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.[4][5] In 2013, Dunham was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[6] In 2014, Dunham released her first book, Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\".[7] In 2015, along with Girls showrunner Jenni Konner, Dunham created the publication Lenny Letter, a feminist online newsletter.[8][9] The publication folded in late 2018.[10] Dunham has starred in feature films such as Supporting Characters and This Is 40 (both 2012) and Happy Christmas (2014). She voiced Mary in the 2016 film My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. On television, aside from Girls, she has played guest roles in Scandal and The Simpsons (both 2015). In 2017, she portrayed Valerie Solanas in American Horror Story: Cult.[11] Dunham's work and her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[12][13] Dunham was born in New York City.[14][15] Her father, Carroll Dunham, is a painter, and her mother, Laurie Simmons, is an artist and photographer, and a member of The Pictures Generation, known for her use of dolls and dollhouse furniture in her photographs of setup interior scenes.[16][17] Her father is Protestant of mostly English ancestry, and her mother is Jewish;[18][19][20][21] Dunham has described herself as feeling \"very culturally Jewish, although that's the biggest clich\u00e9 for a Jewish woman to say.\"[22][23][24] The Dunham family are cousins of the Tiffany family, prominent in the jewelry trade.[25] Dunham attended Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, where she met Tiny Furniture actress and future Girls co-star Jemima Kirke.[26] As a teen, Dunham also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[27] She attended The New School for a year before transferring to Oberlin College,[28][17] where she graduated in 2008 with a degree in creative writing.[17] She has a younger sibling, Grace, a 2014 graduate of Brown University, who appeared in Dunham's first film, Creative Nonfiction, and starred in her second film, Tiny Furniture.[17][29] The siblings were raised in Brooklyn and spent summers in Salisbury, Connecticut.[30] While a student at Oberlin College, Dunham produced several independent short films and uploaded them to YouTube. Many of her early films dealt with themes of sexual enlightenment and were produced in a mumblecore filmmaking style, a dialog-heavy style in which young people talk about their personal relationships. In 2006, she produced Pressure, in which a girl and two friends talk about experiencing an orgasm for the first time, which makes Dunham's character feel pressured to do so as well.[31][32] \"I didn't go to film school\", Dunham explains. \"Instead I went to liberal arts school and self-imposed a curriculum of creating tiny flawed video sketches, brief meditations on comic conundrums, and slapping them on the Internet.\"[33] Another early film, entitled The Fountain, which depicted her in a bikini brushing her teeth in the public fountain at Oberlin College, went viral on YouTube.[34][35] \"Her blithe willingness to disrobe without shame caused an outburst of censure from viewers,\" observed The New Yorker's Rebecca Mead.[17] Dunham was shocked by the backlash and decided to take the video down: There were just pages of YouTube comments about how fat I was, or how not fat I was,\" Dunham said. \"I didn't want you to Google me and the first thing you see is a debate about whether my breasts are misshapen.\"[17]Pressures (2006), Open the Door (2007), Hooker on Campus (2007), and The Fountain (2007) were released as DVD extras with Tiny Furniture.[36] In 2007, Dunham starred in a ten-episode web series for Nerve.com entitled Tight Shots,[37][38] described by The New York Times Magazine's Virginia Heffernan as \"a daffy serial about kids trying to make a movie and be artsy and have tons of sex.\"[39] In 2009, Dunham created the Index Magazine web series, Delusional Downtown Divas, which satirized the New York City art scene. The production was unpaid, so Dunham and her friends \"pooled their money from babysitting and art-assistant gigs and borrowed some camera gear.\"[40] Also in 2009, Dunham premiered Creative Nonfiction\u2014a comedy where she plays Ella, a college student struggling to complete a screenplay[41]\u2014at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. She was initially rejected by the festival the year before; she re-edited and successfully resubmitted the film.[42] Dunham had a career breakthrough with her semiautobiographic 2010 feature film Tiny Furniture; the film won Best Narrative Feature at South by Southwest Music and Media Conference, and subsequently screened at such festivals as Maryland Film Festival.[43] Dunham plays the lead role of Aura.[17] Laurie Simmons (Lena Dunham's real-life mother) plays Aura's mother, and Lena's real-life sibling Grace plays Aura's on-screen sister. For her work on Tiny Furniture, Dunham also won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.[44] The success of Tiny Furniture earned Dunham a blind script deal at HBO.[45] The network set Dunham up with veteran show runner Jennifer Konner. Konner told Vulture's Jada Yuan that she got involved with Dunham because she was an obsessive Tiny Furniture fan: I got a copy of Tiny Furniture from [HBO president] Sue Naegle. Actually, [New Girl creator] Liz Meriwether told me about it and said, 'Oh, there's this great movie. This girl, she's 23, she wrote, directed, and starred in it; she's in her underwear the whole time.' And I was like, 'I really don't want to see that.' And then she was like, 'Oh, trust me, it's great.' So Sue gave it to me just because she had it ... I used to, like, give out copies of the movie. But I'd just broken up with my writing partner and couldn't be less interested in the idea of supervising anybody. I really was like, \"I'm going to find my voice, and be on my own.\" And then they called me and they were like, 'Oh, the Tiny Furniture girl is doing a show, do you want to supervise her?' And I was like, 'Yes! One million percent. Sign me up. Totally on board.'[46]Dunham's star was also raised considerably when she was profiled by David Carr in The New York Times; he was later credited with introducing her to Judd Apatow.[47][48] Apatow watched Tiny Furniture, and was surprised Dunham had also written and directed the film. \"I emailed her and told her I thought it was great,\" Apatow told The Hollywood Reporter. \"It turned out she was in the middle of negotiating a deal to develop a show for HBO and that her partner was Jenni Konner, whom I had worked with on Undeclared and a bunch of other projects. They asked me if I wanted to be a part of it, and I was thrilled to jump in.\"[49] Dunham's television series, Girls, was greenlit by HBO in early 2011.[50] Three episodes were screened to positive response at the 2012 South by Southwest Festival.[51] The series follows Hannah Horvath (portrayed by Dunham), a 20-something writer struggling to get by in New York City. Some of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah\u2014including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions\u2014are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[52] Dunham said Girls reflects a part of the population not portrayed in the 1998 HBO series Sex and the City. \"Gossip Girl was teens duking it out on the Upper East Side and Sex and the City was women who [had] figured out work and friends and now want to nail romance and family life. There was this 'hole-in-between' space that hadn't really been addressed,\" she said.[52] The pilot intentionally references Sex and the City as producers wanted to make it clear that the driving force behind Girls is that the characters were inspired by the former HBO series and moved to New York to pursue their dreams.[52] Dunham herself says she \"revere[s] that show just as much as any girl of my generation\".[52] The first season premiered on HBO on April 15, 2012, and received critical acclaim. The New York Times applauded the series, writing that \"Girls may be the millennial generation's rebuttal to Sex and the City, but the first season was at times as cruelly insightful and bleakly funny as Louie on FX or Curb Your Enthusiasm on HBO.\"[53] James Poniewozik from Time reserved high praise for the series, calling it \"raw, audacious, nuanced and richly, often excruciatingly funny\".[54] Despite the acclaim, the series also generated significant criticism over its lack of racial representation and Dunham's frequent on-screen nudity.[55][56] The first season garnered Dunham four Emmy Award nominations for her roles in acting, writing, and directing the series, as well as two Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy and Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy.[57][58] In February 2013, Dunham became the first woman to win a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Comedy Series for her work on Girls.[59] Girls was renewed for a second season in April 2012, before the first season had finished airing.[60] The finale episode of the first season drew over one million viewers.[61] The second season of Girls continued to receive critical acclaim. David Wiegland of the San Francisco Chronicle said that \"The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites in Girls is realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial\".[62] Verne Gay of Newsday said it is \"Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted\".[63] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt that \"As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season, Girls may now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier\".[64] The second season ran on HBO from January 2013 to March 2013, with third and fourth seasons subsequently being renewed. The third season of Girls premiered in January 2014 with over one million viewers.[65] The following month, Dunham hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live with musical guest The National.[66] In late 2012, Dunham signed a $3.5\u00a0million deal with Random House to publish her first book.[67] The book, an essay collection called Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\", was published in September 2014.[68] It reached number two on The New York Times Best Seller list in October 2014.[69] On January 5, 2015, days before the premiere of the fourth season, Girls was renewed for a fifth season,[70] despite dwindling viewership.[71] That year, Dunham launched A Casual Romance Productions, a production company to develop television and film projects.[72] The company produced It's Me Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise.[73] On February 20, 2015, it was reported that Dunham had been cast in a guest role in an episode of the ABC drama series Scandal, which aired March 19, 2015.[74] In September 2015, Dunham stated that the sixth season of Girls was likely to be the last season.[75] This was later confirmed by HBO.[76] In 2016, Dunham appeared in her mother's film, My Art,[77] which had its world premiere at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival.[78] She also voiced Mary in My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, a 2016 American animated teen comedy drama film directed by Dash Shaw.[79] It was selected to be screened in the Vanguard section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.[80] Dunham also filmed scenes for the film Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, but they were cut from the final film. In 2017, she portrayed Valerie Solanas, the real-life radical feminist and SCUM Manifesto author who attempted to murder Andy Warhol in the late 1960s, in American Horror Story: Cult.[11] Girls' sixth and final season concluded on April 16, 2017, leaving a total of 62 episodes in the series.[81][82] Since 2016, Dunham has been working on a second book that will be published by Random House.[83] In February 2018, A Casual Romance Productions announced that it would be producing Camping, a remake of the British comedy series of the same name for HBO, with Jennifer Garner in the lead and Dunham and Konner as showrunners and writers.[84][85] On July 25, 2018, the series held a panel at the Television Critics Association's annual summer press tour featuring executive producer Jenni Konner and cast member Jennifer Garner.[86] The following day, a teaser trailer for the series was released.[87] Camping has been met with a mixed to negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 28% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10 based on 32 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The first season of Camping makes it difficult to determine who the least happy campers are: those on the screen or those watching it.\"[88] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 49 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"[89] In August 2018, it was announced Dunham would appear in the film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, directed by Quentin Tarantino, which released on July 26, 2019.[90] Dunham portrayed the role of Catherine \"Gypsy\" Share.[91] In October 2018, coinciding with the expiration of their joint HBO contract, Dunham and Konner split as producing partners, dissolved their production company, and signed separate deals with HBO.[92] In June 2019, it was announced Dunham would direct the first episode of Industry and serve as an executive producer.[93] Dunham has appeared on several magazine covers, including Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire, and Rolling Stone. After Dunham posed with bare legs for Glamour's February 2017 cover, she praised the magazine for featuring an unedited photo and leaving the cellulite on her thighs visible.[94][95] In 2015, Dunham, with Jenni Konner, co-founded Lenny Letter, a feminist online newsletter.[8][9] Lenny Letter was initially supported by Hearst Corporation advertising,[96] and subsequently by Cond\u00e9 Nast.[97] In addition to the regular newsletter, Lenny Letter published a Fiction Issue and a Poetry Issue during fall 2015.[98] Notable articles include an essay written by actress Jennifer Lawrence about the gender wage gap in Hollywood,[99] and one written by singer Alicia Keys about her decision to start wearing little to no make-up.[100] In November 2017, following Dunham and Konner's controversial letter denouncing Aurora Perrineau's accusation of sexual assault by Murray Miller, Zinzi Clemmons announced that she would no longer contribute to the newsletter, saying Dunham's racism was \"well-known\" and called for all women of color to \"divest\" from Dunham.[101] In October 2018, Dunham and Konner announced that Lenny Letter would be shutting down,[10][102] reportedly due to a decline in subscribers and failure to build momentum upon other platforms.[103] At its height in 2017, Lenny Letter had over 500,000 subscribers.[104] Dunham's work and her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[12][13] On several occasions, Dunham has been accused of making racist remarks.[105][106][107] Upon release, Girls was met with criticism regarding the all-white main cast in the otherwise culturally diverse setting of New York City (the only black actors in the pilot were a homeless man and a taxi driver, and the only Asian actress had the sole trait of being good at Photoshop).[108][109] Donald Glover guest starred as Sandy, a black Republican and Hannah's love interest, in the first two episodes of season two, which was criticized as tokenism in response to the initial backlash from the first season.[110] Dunham spoke publicly about the criticism on several occasions; in an interview with IndieWire, she said: I am a half-Jew, half-WASP, and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like \u2014 not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.[111]In her book, Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\", Dunham wrote about being sexually assaulted by an Oberlin College classmate, which resulted in controversy regarding the accuracy of her account and a case of mistaken identity when a former Oberlin College student named Barry (the pseudonym used for Dunham's alleged attacker in her book) sought legal advice to ensure people didn't associate him with the content.[112][113][114] In the book, Dunham describes \"Barry\" as a guy who wore cowboy boots, sported a mustache, hosted a radio show, worked at a campus library, and graduated Oberlin in 2005. According to the man's attorney, Aaron Minc, that description warrants enough detail to point a finger at his client.[115] Dunham later apologized for the confusion and Random House reprinted the book with a clarification, releasing a statement saying: \"Random House, on our own behalf and on behalf of our author, regrets the confusion.\"[115][116] Other passages in the book recounting interactions of a sexual nature, starting when she was seven years old, with her then one-year-old sibling Grace also attracted significant controversy,[117] and prompted numerous think pieces about children's sexuality and personal boundaries.[118][119][120] In September 2016, Dunham criticized NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. for his interactions with her at the Met Gala. Dunham said, \"I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, 'That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.' It wasn't mean \u2014 he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, 'Do I want to f--- it? Is it wearing a ... yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone.\" She added, \"It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, 'This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes'.[121] Dunham was criticized for her comments, which some considered to be an example of white entitlement.[122][123] She later apologized for her characterization of his interactions and thoughts.[124] In December 2016, Dunham declared on a podcast that she wished she'd had an abortion, explaining that she wanted to better understand women who have. The comment was widely condemned as insensitive.[125][126] Dunham later issued a lengthy apology on her Instagram.[127][128] In November 2017, Dunham briefly defended Girls writer Murray Miller, whom actress Aurora Perrineau had accused of sexually assaulting her in 2012 when she was seventeen. Dunham responded to the accusations by saying \"While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story, our insider knowledge of Murray's situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year.\"[129] After an immediate backlash, Dunham apologized for that statement, saying that it was \"absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement\" and that \"every woman who comes forward deserves to be heard, fully and completely, and our relationship to the accused should not be part of the calculation anyone makes when examining her case.\"[129] Dunham was described as a \"hipster racist\" for her defense of Miller, as Perrineau is of mixed race.[130][131] In December 2018, Dunham admitted lying to defend Miller, saying that she had no \"insider information\".[132][133][134] In 2012, Dunham began dating Jack Antonoff, the lead guitarist of the band fun. and the founder of Bleachers.[135][136] Dunham and Antonoff remained together until December 2017; they subsequently separated announcing that the separation was \"amicable\".[137][138] Dunham was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder as a child, and continues to take a low dose of an antidepressant to relieve her anxiety.[139][140] In February 2018, Dunham wrote an essay for Vogue about her decision to have a hysterectomy due to endometriosis.[141] In fall of 2012, Dunham appeared in a video advertisement promoting President Barack Obama's re-election, delivering a monologue, which, according to a blog quoted in The Atlantic, tried to \"get the youth vote by comparing voting for the first time to having sex for the first time\".[142] Fox News reported criticism from Media Research Center's Lauren Thompson, public relations professional Ronn Torossian, and media trainer Louise Pennell, which labeled the advertisement as tasteless, inappropriate, and a ploy to lure the younger female vote. It included a comment from Steve Hall of Ad Rants saying that \"not everyone was so offended.\" A friend of Dunham said the actress was not paid for her performance on the spot, and Dunham defended the ad by tweeting \"The video may be light but the message is serious: vote for women's rights.\"[143] In The Nation, Ari Melber wrote \"the ad's style is vintage Lena: edgy and informed, controversial but achingly self-aware, sexually proud and affirmatively feminist.\"[144] In 2014, Dunham was named the Recipient of Horizon Award 2014 by Point Foundation for her support of the gay community.[145] In April 2016, she wrote in support of Hillary Clinton, pledging to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, if Donald Trump won the election.[146][147][148] After Trump's win, Dunham wrote she will not be moving to Canada, saying, \"I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and love and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right.\"[149] In June 2017, Dunham endorsed Jim Johnson, a Democratic New Jersey gubernatorial candidate.[150] Later that month, Dunham endorsed Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, in the United Kingdom general election.[151]",

She is known as the creator, writer, and star of the HBO television series Girls (2012\u20132017), for which she received several Emmy Award nominations and two Golden Globe Awards.[1][2] Dunham also directed several episodes of Girls and became the first woman to win the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Comedy Series.[3] Prior to Girls, Dunham wrote, directed, and starred in the semi-autobiographical independent film Tiny Furniture (2010), for which she won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.[4][5]\nIn 2013, Dunham was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[6] In 2014, Dunham released her first book, Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\".[7] In 2015, along with Girls showrunner Jenni Konner, Dunham created the publication Lenny Letter, a feminist online newsletter.[8][9] The publication folded in late 2018.[10]\nDunham has starred in feature films such as Supporting Characters and This Is 40 (both 2012) and Happy Christmas (2014). She voiced Mary in the 2016 film My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. On television, aside from Girls, she has played guest roles in Scandal and The Simpsons (both 2015). In 2017, she portrayed Valerie Solanas in American Horror Story: Cult.[11]\nDunham's work and her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[12][13]\nDunham was born in New York City.[14][15] Her father, Carroll Dunham, is a painter, and her mother, Laurie Simmons, is an artist and photographer, and a member of The Pictures Generation, known for her use of dolls and dollhouse furniture in her photographs of setup interior scenes.[16][17] Her father is Protestant of mostly English ancestry, and her mother is Jewish;[18][19][20][21] Dunham has described herself as feeling \"very culturally Jewish, although that's the biggest clich\u00e9 for a Jewish woman to say.\"[22][23][24] The Dunham family are cousins of the Tiffany family, prominent in the jewelry trade.[25]\nDunham attended Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, where she met Tiny Furniture actress and future Girls co-star Jemima Kirke.[26] As a teen, Dunham also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[27] She attended The New School for a year before transferring to Oberlin College,[28][17] where she graduated in 2008 with a degree in creative writing.[17]\nShe has a younger sibling, Grace, a 2014 graduate of Brown University, who appeared in Dunham's first film, Creative Nonfiction, and starred in her second film, Tiny Furniture.[17][29] The siblings were raised in Brooklyn and spent summers in Salisbury, Connecticut.[30]\nWhile a student at Oberlin College, Dunham produced several independent short films and uploaded them to YouTube. Many of her early films dealt with themes of sexual enlightenment and were produced in a mumblecore filmmaking style, a dialog-heavy style in which young people talk about their personal relationships. In 2006, she produced Pressure, in which a girl and two friends talk about experiencing an orgasm for the first time, which makes Dunham's character feel pressured to do so as well.[31][32] \"I didn't go to film school\", Dunham explains. \"Instead I went to liberal arts school and self-imposed a curriculum of creating tiny flawed video sketches, brief meditations on comic conundrums, and slapping them on the Internet.\"[33]\nAnother early film, entitled The Fountain, which depicted her in a bikini brushing her teeth in the public fountain at Oberlin College, went viral on YouTube.[34][35] \"Her blithe willingness to disrobe without shame caused an outburst of censure from viewers,\" observed The New Yorker's Rebecca Mead.[17] Dunham was shocked by the backlash and decided to take the video down:\nThere were just pages of YouTube comments about how fat I was, or how not fat I was,\" Dunham said. \"I didn't want you to Google me and the first thing you see is a debate about whether my breasts are misshapen.\"[17]Pressures (2006), Open the Door (2007), Hooker on Campus (2007), and The Fountain (2007) were released as DVD extras with Tiny Furniture.[36]\nIn 2007, Dunham starred in a ten-episode web series for Nerve.com entitled Tight Shots,[37][38] described by The New York Times Magazine's Virginia Heffernan as \"a daffy serial about kids trying to make a movie and be artsy and have tons of sex.\"[39]\nIn 2009, Dunham created the Index Magazine web series, Delusional Downtown Divas, which satirized the New York City art scene. The production was unpaid, so Dunham and her friends \"pooled their money from babysitting and art-assistant gigs and borrowed some camera gear.\"[40]\nAlso in 2009, Dunham premiered Creative Nonfiction\u2014a comedy where she plays Ella, a college student struggling to complete a screenplay[41]\u2014at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. She was initially rejected by the festival the year before; she re-edited and successfully resubmitted the film.[42]\nDunham had a career breakthrough with her semiautobiographic 2010 feature film Tiny Furniture; the film won Best Narrative Feature at South by Southwest Music and Media Conference, and subsequently screened at such festivals as Maryland Film Festival.[43] Dunham plays the lead role of Aura.[17] Laurie Simmons (Lena Dunham's real-life mother) plays Aura's mother, and Lena's real-life sibling Grace plays Aura's on-screen sister. For her work on Tiny Furniture, Dunham also won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.[44]\nThe success of Tiny Furniture earned Dunham a blind script deal at HBO.[45] The network set Dunham up with veteran show runner Jennifer Konner. Konner told Vulture's Jada Yuan that she got involved with Dunham because she was an obsessive Tiny Furniture fan:\nI got a copy of Tiny Furniture from [HBO president] Sue Naegle. Actually, [New Girl creator] Liz Meriwether told me about it and said, 'Oh, there's this great movie. This girl, she's 23, she wrote, directed, and starred in it; she's in her underwear the whole time.' And I was like, 'I really don't want to see that.' And then she was like, 'Oh, trust me, it's great.' So Sue gave it to me just because she had it ... I used to, like, give out copies of the movie. But I'd just broken up with my writing partner and couldn't be less interested in the idea of supervising anybody. I really was like, \"I'm going to find my voice, and be on my own.\" And then they called me and they were like, 'Oh, the Tiny Furniture girl is doing a show, do you want to supervise her?' And I was like, 'Yes! One million percent. Sign me up. Totally on board.'[46]Dunham's star was also raised considerably when she was profiled by David Carr in The New York Times; he was later credited with introducing her to Judd Apatow.[47][48] Apatow watched Tiny Furniture, and was surprised Dunham had also written and directed the film. \"I emailed her and told her I thought it was great,\" Apatow told The Hollywood Reporter. \"It turned out she was in the middle of negotiating a deal to develop a show for HBO and that her partner was Jenni Konner, whom I had worked with on Undeclared and a bunch of other projects. They asked me if I wanted to be a part of it, and I was thrilled to jump in.\"[49]\nDunham's television series, Girls, was greenlit by HBO in early 2011.[50] Three episodes were screened to positive response at the 2012 South by Southwest Festival.[51]\nThe series follows Hannah Horvath (portrayed by Dunham), a 20-something writer struggling to get by in New York City. Some of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah\u2014including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions\u2014are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[52]\nDunham said Girls reflects a part of the population not portrayed in the 1998 HBO series Sex and the City. \"Gossip Girl was teens duking it out on the Upper East Side and Sex and the City was women who [had] figured out work and friends and now want to nail romance and family life. There was this 'hole-in-between' space that hadn't really been addressed,\" she said.[52] The pilot intentionally references Sex and the City as producers wanted to make it clear that the driving force behind Girls is that the characters were inspired by the former HBO series and moved to New York to pursue their dreams.[52] Dunham herself says she \"revere[s] that show just as much as any girl of my generation\".[52]\nThe first season premiered on HBO on April 15, 2012, and received critical acclaim. The New York Times applauded the series, writing that \"Girls may be the millennial generation's rebuttal to Sex and the City, but the first season was at times as cruelly insightful and bleakly funny as Louie on FX or Curb Your Enthusiasm on HBO.\"[53] James Poniewozik from Time reserved high praise for the series, calling it \"raw, audacious, nuanced and richly, often excruciatingly funny\".[54]\nDespite the acclaim, the series also generated significant criticism over its lack of racial representation and Dunham's frequent on-screen nudity.[55][56]\nThe first season garnered Dunham four Emmy Award nominations for her roles in acting, writing, and directing the series, as well as two Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy and Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy.[57][58] In February 2013, Dunham became the first woman to win a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Comedy Series for her work on Girls.[59]\nGirls was renewed for a second season in April 2012, before the first season had finished airing.[60] The finale episode of the first season drew over one million viewers.[61]\nThe second season of Girls continued to receive critical acclaim. David Wiegland of the San Francisco Chronicle said that \"The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites in Girls is realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial\".[62] Verne Gay of Newsday said it is \"Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted\".[63] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt that \"As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season, Girls may now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier\".[64] The second season ran on HBO from January 2013 to March 2013, with third and fourth seasons subsequently being renewed. The third season of Girls premiered in January 2014 with over one million viewers.[65] The following month, Dunham hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live with musical guest The National.[66]\nIn late 2012, Dunham signed a $3.5\u00a0million deal with Random House to publish her first book.[67] The book, an essay collection called Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\", was published in September 2014.[68] It reached number two on The New York Times Best Seller list in October 2014.[69]\n\nOn January 5, 2015, days before the premiere of the fourth season, Girls was renewed for a fifth season,[70] despite dwindling viewership.[71] That year, Dunham launched A Casual Romance Productions, a production company to develop television and film projects.[72] The company produced It's Me Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise.[73] On February 20, 2015, it was reported that Dunham had been cast in a guest role in an episode of the ABC drama series Scandal, which aired March 19, 2015.[74] In September 2015, Dunham stated that the sixth season of Girls was likely to be the last season.[75] This was later confirmed by HBO.[76]\nIn 2016, Dunham appeared in her mother's film, My Art,[77] which had its world premiere at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival.[78] She also voiced Mary in My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea, a 2016 American animated teen comedy drama film directed by Dash Shaw.[79] It was selected to be screened in the Vanguard section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.[80] Dunham also filmed scenes for the film Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, but they were cut from the final film.\nIn 2017, she portrayed Valerie Solanas, the real-life radical feminist and SCUM Manifesto author who attempted to murder Andy Warhol in the late 1960s, in American Horror Story: Cult.[11]\nGirls' sixth and final season concluded on April 16, 2017, leaving a total of 62 episodes in the series.[81][82]\nSince 2016, Dunham has been working on a second book that will be published by Random House.[83]\nIn February 2018, A Casual Romance Productions announced that it would be producing Camping, a remake of the British comedy series of the same name for HBO, with Jennifer Garner in the lead and Dunham and Konner as showrunners and writers.[84][85] On July 25, 2018, the series held a panel at the Television Critics Association's annual summer press tour featuring executive producer Jenni Konner and cast member Jennifer Garner.[86] The following day, a teaser trailer for the series was released.[87]\nCamping has been met with a mixed to negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 28% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10 based on 32 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The first season of Camping makes it difficult to determine who the least happy campers are: those on the screen or those watching it.\"[88] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 49 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"[89]\nIn August 2018, it was announced Dunham would appear in the film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, directed by Quentin Tarantino, which released on July 26, 2019.[90] Dunham  portrayed the role of Catherine \"Gypsy\" Share.[91] In October 2018, coinciding with the expiration of their joint HBO contract, Dunham and Konner split as producing partners, dissolved their production company, and signed separate deals with HBO.[92]\nIn June 2019, it was announced Dunham would direct the first episode of Industry and serve as an executive producer.[93]\nDunham has appeared on several magazine covers, including Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire, and Rolling Stone. After Dunham posed with bare legs for Glamour's February 2017 cover, she praised the magazine for featuring an unedited photo and leaving the cellulite on her thighs visible.[94][95]\nIn 2015, Dunham, with Jenni Konner, co-founded Lenny Letter, a feminist online newsletter.[8][9] Lenny Letter was initially supported by Hearst Corporation advertising,[96] and subsequently by Cond\u00e9 Nast.[97] In addition to the regular newsletter, Lenny Letter published a Fiction Issue and a Poetry Issue during fall 2015.[98]\nNotable articles include an essay written by actress Jennifer Lawrence about the gender wage gap in Hollywood,[99] and one written by singer Alicia Keys about her decision to start wearing little to no make-up.[100]\nIn November 2017, following Dunham and Konner's controversial letter denouncing Aurora Perrineau's accusation of sexual assault by Murray Miller, Zinzi Clemmons announced that she would no longer contribute to the newsletter, saying Dunham's racism was \"well-known\" and called for all women of color to \"divest\" from Dunham.[101]\nIn October 2018, Dunham and Konner announced that Lenny Letter would be shutting down,[10][102] reportedly due to a decline in subscribers and failure to build momentum upon other platforms.[103] At its height in 2017, Lenny Letter had over 500,000 subscribers.[104]\nDunham's work and her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[12][13] On several occasions, Dunham has been accused of making racist remarks.[105][106][107]\nUpon release, Girls was met with criticism regarding the all-white main cast in the otherwise culturally diverse setting of New York City (the only black actors in the pilot were a homeless man and a taxi driver, and the only Asian actress had the sole trait of being good at Photoshop).[108][109] Donald Glover guest starred as Sandy, a black Republican and Hannah's love interest, in the first two episodes of season two, which was criticized as tokenism in response to the initial backlash from the first season.[110]\nDunham spoke publicly about the criticism on several occasions; in an interview with IndieWire, she said:\nI am a half-Jew, half-WASP, and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like \u2014 not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.[111]In her book, Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\", Dunham wrote about being sexually assaulted by an Oberlin College classmate, which resulted in controversy regarding the accuracy of her account and a case of mistaken identity when a former Oberlin College student named Barry (the pseudonym used for Dunham's alleged attacker in her book) sought legal advice to ensure people didn't associate him with the content.[112][113][114] In the book, Dunham describes \"Barry\" as a guy who wore cowboy boots, sported a mustache, hosted a radio show, worked at a campus library, and graduated Oberlin in 2005. According to the man's attorney, Aaron Minc, that description warrants enough detail to point a finger at his client.[115] Dunham later apologized for the confusion and Random House reprinted the book with a clarification, releasing a statement saying: \"Random House, on our own behalf and on behalf of our author, regrets the confusion.\"[115][116]\nOther passages in the book recounting interactions of a sexual nature, starting when she was seven years old, with her then one-year-old sibling Grace also attracted significant controversy,[117] and prompted numerous think pieces about children's sexuality and personal boundaries.[118][119][120]\nIn September 2016, Dunham criticized NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. for his interactions with her at the Met Gala. Dunham said, \"I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, 'That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.' It wasn't mean \u2014 he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, 'Do I want to f--- it? Is it wearing a ... yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone.\" She added, \"It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, 'This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes'.[121] Dunham was criticized for her comments, which some considered to be an example of white entitlement.[122][123] She later apologized for her characterization of his interactions and thoughts.[124]\nIn December 2016, Dunham declared on a podcast that she wished she'd had an abortion, explaining that she wanted to better understand women who have. The comment was widely condemned as insensitive.[125][126] Dunham later issued a lengthy apology on her Instagram.[127][128]\nIn November 2017, Dunham briefly defended Girls writer Murray Miller, whom actress Aurora Perrineau had accused of sexually assaulting her in 2012 when she was seventeen. Dunham responded to the accusations by saying \"While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story, our insider knowledge of Murray's situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year.\"[129] After an immediate backlash, Dunham apologized for that statement, saying that it was \"absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement\" and that \"every woman who comes forward deserves to be heard, fully and completely, and our relationship to the accused should not be part of the calculation anyone makes when examining her case.\"[129] Dunham was described as a \"hipster racist\" for her defense of Miller, as Perrineau is of mixed race.[130][131] In December 2018, Dunham admitted lying to defend Miller, saying that she had no \"insider information\".[132][133][134]\nIn 2012, Dunham began dating Jack Antonoff, the lead guitarist of the band fun. and the founder of Bleachers.[135][136] Dunham and Antonoff remained together until December 2017; they subsequently separated announcing that the separation was \"amicable\".[137][138]\nDunham was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder as a child, and continues to take a low dose of an antidepressant to relieve her anxiety.[139][140]\nIn February 2018, Dunham wrote an essay for Vogue about her decision to have a hysterectomy due to endometriosis.[141]\nIn fall of 2012, Dunham appeared in a video advertisement promoting President Barack Obama's re-election, delivering a monologue, which, according to a blog quoted in The Atlantic, tried to \"get the youth vote by comparing voting for the first time to having sex for the first time\".[142] Fox News reported criticism from Media Research Center's Lauren Thompson, public relations professional Ronn Torossian, and media trainer Louise Pennell, which labeled the advertisement as tasteless, inappropriate, and a ploy to lure the younger female vote. It included a comment from Steve Hall of Ad Rants saying that \"not everyone was so offended.\" A friend of Dunham said the actress was not paid for her performance on the spot, and Dunham defended the ad by tweeting \"The video may be light but the message is serious: vote for women's rights.\"[143] In The Nation, Ari Melber wrote \"the ad's style is vintage Lena: edgy and informed, controversial but achingly self-aware, sexually proud and affirmatively feminist.\"[144]\nIn 2014, Dunham was named the Recipient of Horizon Award 2014 by Point Foundation for her support of the gay community.[145]\nIn April 2016, she wrote in support of Hillary Clinton, pledging to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, if Donald Trump won the election.[146][147][148] After Trump's win, Dunham wrote she will not be moving to Canada, saying,  \"I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and love and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right.\"[149]\nIn June 2017, Dunham endorsed Jim Johnson, a Democratic New Jersey gubernatorial candidate.[150] Later that month, Dunham endorsed Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, in the United Kingdom general election.[151]\n</body></html>"
