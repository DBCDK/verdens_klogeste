                "text": "no title\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg (/\u02c8z\u028ck\u0259rb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/; born May 14, 1984) is an American internet entrepreneur and philanthropist. Zuckerberg is known for co-founding and leading Facebook, Inc. and its namesake social networking website as its chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.[3][4] He also co-founded and is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot.[5] Born in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[6] Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His net worth is estimated to be $74 billion as of December 2019, increasing over the past year with Facebook stock as a whole.[7] In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of 2019, he is the only person under 50 in the Forbes ten richest people list, and the only one under 40 in the Top 20 Billionaires list.[8] Since 2010, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year award.[9][10][11] In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.[12] Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York.[13] His parents are Karen (n\u00e9e Kempner), a psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist.[14] He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna and Arielle, were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester County village about 21 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.[15] Zuckerberg was raised in a Reform Jewish household,[16][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and his ancestors hailed from Germany, Austria and Poland.[17] He had a Star Wars themed Bar Mitzvah when he turned 13[16][18] and once \"questioned things\" before deciding \"religion is very important\".[19] At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classes. After two years, he transferred to the private school Phillips Exeter Academy, where he won prizes in mathematics, astronomy, physics, and classical studies. In his youth, he also attended the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth summer camp. On his college application, Zuckerberg stated that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.[20][21][22] Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called \"ZuckNet\" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a \"primitive\" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.[23][24] According to writer Jose Antonio Vargas, \"some kids played computer games. Mark created them.\" Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: \"I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it.\" Vargas notes that Zuckerberg was not, however, a typical \"geek-klutz\", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was \"really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff\", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem Aeneid, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.[15] During Zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[25] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[26] Vargas noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard, he had already achieved a \"reputation as a programming prodigy\". He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.[10][15][27] In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, \"he built the site for fun\". Hasit explains: We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was \"hotter\" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[28]The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was \"completely improper.\"[28] The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[29] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \"Thefacebook\", originally located at thefacebook.com.[30] Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.[31] The three complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response.[citation needed] Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.[32] The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares.[33] Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete his project.[34] In January 2014, he recalled: I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after\u2014I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, \"You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world.\" But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.[35]On May 28, 2017, Zuckerberg received an honorary degree from Harvard.[36][37] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room.[39][40] An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, \"The Photo Address Book\", which students referred to as \"The Facebook\". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.[39] Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a \"Harvard thing\" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They began with Columbia University, New York University, Stanford, Dartmouth, Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Yale.[41] Samyr Laine, a triple jumper representing Haiti at the 2012 Summer Olympics, shared a room with Zuckerberg during Facebook's founding. \"Mark was clearly on to great things,\" said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth user.[42] Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to Palo Alto, California in Silicon Valley where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California.[43][44] They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: \"It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me.\"[40] He restated these goals to Wired magazine in 2010: \"The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open.\"[45] Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook.[46] On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.[47] When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained: I guess we could\u00a0... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads\u00a0... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.[45]In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg \"clearly thinks of himself as a hacker\". Zuckerberg said that \"it's OK to break things\" \"to make them better\".[48][49] Facebook instituted \"hackathons\" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.[48] The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.[49] \"The idea is that you can build something really good in a night\", Zuckerberg told Levy. \"And that's part of the personality of Facebook now\u00a0... It's definitely very core to my personality.\"[48] Vanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 \"most influential people of the Information Age\".[50] Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009.[51] In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesman's annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.[52] In a 2011 interview with PBS shortly after the death of Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was \"focused on building as high quality and good things as you are\".[53] On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.[54] Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had around 34 million.[55] Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, claimed that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013.[56] On August 19, 2013, The Washington Post reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.[57] At the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion humans who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.[58][59] Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, claiming that mobile represents the future of the company.[60] Zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries.[61] Alongside other American technology figures like Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook, Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the \"Internet czar\" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin Chinese; although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.[62] Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could \"learn how to better serve the community\".[63][64] Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook.[65] In June 2016, Business Insider named Zuckerberg one of the \"Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World\" along with Elon Musk and Sal Khan, due to the fact that he and his wife \"pledged to give away 99% of their wealth \u2014 which is estimated at $55.0 billion.\"[66] A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang, was launched. i2hub focused on peer-to-peer file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications.[67][68] On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Platform, a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.[69] On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, eBay sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook,[70] taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service. In 2007, Zuckerberg was added to MIT Technology Review's TR35 list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[71] On July 23, 2008, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Connect, a version of Facebook Platform for users.[citation needed] In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the Internet.org project in late August 2013. He explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the five billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. Using a three-tier strategy, Internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to Zuckerberg. He stated in his post: The world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.[59]To stay proven on the efforts of bringing in the concept of net neutrality, Zuckerberg met Narendra Modi, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Silicon Valley, to discuss on how to effectively establish affordable internet access to the less developed countries.[72] As a token of initiation, he changed his Facebook profile picture to extend his support to the Digital India to help the rural communities to stay connected to the internet.[73] Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU).[74] They filed a lawsuit in 2004, but it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.[75] In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138, a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Facebook filed to have the documents removed, but the judge ruled in favor of 02138.[76] A lawsuit filed by Eduardo Saverin against Facebook and Zuckerberg was settled out of court. Though terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook. Saverin signed a non-disclosure contract after the settlement.[77] In June 2010, Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a \"Draw Muhammad\" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly.[78][79] In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County, upstate New York, filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was Facemash, the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as \"completely frivolous\". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.[80][81] On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of \"tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars.\" Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them.[82] Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.[83][84] On July 2, 2016, Israeli cabinet minister Gilad Erdan accused Zuckerberg of having some responsibility for deadly attacks by Palestinians against Israelis.[85] According to him, the social network was not doing enough to ban posts to its platform that incite violence against Israelis.[86] \"Some of the victims' blood is on Zuckerberg's hands\", Erdan said.[87] In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight \"quiet title and partition\" lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to purchase small tracts of land which they own. This land is contained within the 700 acres of land in the Hawaiian island of Kauai that Zuckerberg had purchased in 2014. When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits.[88][89] On April 10 and April 11, 2018, Zuckerberg began testifying before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding the usage of personal data by Facebook in relation to the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data breach.[90] He has called the whole affair a breach of trust between Aleksandr Kogan, Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook.[91] Zuckerberg has refused requests to appear to give evidence on the matter to a Parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom.[92] A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social Network was released on October 1, 2010, starring Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, \"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\"[93] Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a \"good guy\".[94] The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as \"big juicy fun\" rather than \"reportage\".[95] The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, \"I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling\", adding, \"What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\"[96] Upon winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg \"for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other.\"[97] Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:[98] On January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was being hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they ever met.[99] Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, \"It was interesting.\"[100] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was \"nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him\u00a0...\" He adds, \"Mark has been so gracious about something that's really so uncomfortable\u00a0... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It's the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable.\"[101][102] Jeff Jarvis, author of the book Public Parts, interviewed Zuckerberg and believes Sorkin made up too much of the story. He states, \"That's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts.\"[103] According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at Fortune magazine and author of The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World, (2011),[104] \"the film is only \"40% true\u00a0... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie.\" He says that \"a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false\", and concludes that primarily \"his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet\".[103] Although the film portrays Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard, Zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs.[15] Kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is \"false\". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, notes that the \"image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated\u00a0... It is fiction\u00a0...\" He likewise dismisses the film's assertion that he \"would deliberately betray a friend\".[103] Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of The Simpsons titled \"Loan-a Lisa\", which first aired on October 3, 2010. In the episode, Lisa Simpson and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing Bill Gates and Richard Branson as examples.[105] On October 9, 2010, Saturday Night Live lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook.[106] Andy Samberg played Zuckerberg. The real Zuckerberg was reported to have been amused: \"I thought this was funny.\"[107] Stephen Colbert awarded a \"Medal of Fear\" to Zuckerberg at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, \"because he values his privacy much more than he values yours\".[108] Zuckerberg appears in the climax of the documentary film Terms and Conditions May Apply.[109][110][111] Zuckerberg was parodied in the South Park episode \"Franchise Prequel\".[112] On December 7, 2018, Epic Rap Battles of History released a rap battle between Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.[113] Zuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to Diaspora, an open-source personal Web server that implements a distributed social networking service. He called it a \"cool idea\".[45] Zuckerberg founded the Start-up: Education foundation.[114][115] On September 22, 2010, it was reported that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey.[116][117] Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg.[118] Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, \"The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate.\"[119] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.[119] The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.[120][121] On December 9, 2010, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett signed \"The Giving Pledge\", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity.[122] In December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan announced that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to \"advancing human potential and promoting equality\" in the spirit of The Giving Pledge.[123][124] On December 1, 2015, they announced they would eventually give 99 percent of their Facebook shares (worth about US$45 billion at the time) to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.[125][126] On December 19, 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, to be executed by the end of the month\u2014based on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. On December 31, 2013, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for 2013.[127] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity.[128] In October 2014, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated US$25 million to combat the Ebola virus disease, specifically the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[129][130] in 2016, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announced that it would give $600 million to Biohub a location in San Francisco's Mission Bay District near the University of California, San Francisco, to allow for easy interaction and collaboration between scientists at UCSF; University of California, Berkeley; and Stanford University. On December 1, 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan announced the birth of their first daughter Max, and in an open letter to Max, they pledged to transfer 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at US$45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, their new organization that will focus on health and education. The funds will not be transferred immediately, but over the course of their lives.[131][132] Instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and other tech billionaires have done, Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company. This has drawn criticism from a number of journalists.[133][134][135][136] On August 28, 2017, Chan and Zuckerberg announced the birth of their second daughter.[137] In 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County, New York, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as \"no preference\" on voter rolls, and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections, in 2008 and 2012.[138][139] Zuckerberg has never revealed his own political views: some news outlets consider him to be a conservative,[140][141] while others consider him liberal.[142] On February 13, 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Zuckerberg's particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools.[143][144] Later that year, Zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for Newark mayor Cory Booker, who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election.[145] In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a US$100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools.[146] In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.[147][148] On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg.[149][150][151][152] The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public,[153][154] yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.[155] In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or not buy Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of Zuckerberg ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform.[clarification needed][156] A media report on June 20, 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is \"just about tech wanting to hire more people\", the Internet entrepreneur replied: \"The bigger problem we're trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.\"[157] In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration. The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional.[158][159] When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government \"blew it.\" He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.[58] Zuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9, 2015 which said that he wants \"to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world\" in response to the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2015 San Bernardino attack.[160][161][162][163] The statement also said that Muslims are \"always welcome\" on Facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that \"as a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities.\"[164][165] On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten \"Black Lives Matter\" phrases on the company walls and had written \"All Lives Matter\" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but \"malicious as well.\" According to Zuckerberg's memo, \"Black Lives Matter doesn't mean other lives don't -- it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve.\" The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, \"means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's.\" Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.[166][167][168] New York's Daily News interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, \"Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure.\"[166] In January 2017, Zuckerberg criticized Donald Trump's executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries.[169] Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie criticized Zuckerberg over Facebook's role in spreading religious intolerance in Sri Lanka.[170] Moulavi Zahran Hashim, a radical Islamist imam believed to be the mastermind behind the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, preached on a pro-ISIL Facebook account, known as \"Al-Ghuraba\" media.[171][172] Zuckerberg met his future wife, fellow student Priscilla Chan, at a fraternity party during his sophomore year at Harvard. They began dating in 2003.[173][174] In September 2010, Zuckerberg invited Chan, by then a medical student at the University of California,[175] to move into his rented Palo Alto house. Zuckerberg studied Mandarin in preparation for the couple's visit to China in December 2010.[176][177] On May 19, 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan married in Zuckerberg's backyard in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school.[178][179][180] On July 31, 2015, Zuckerberg announced that the couple was expecting a baby girl and revealed that Chan had experienced three miscarriages previously.[181] On December 1, Zuckerberg announced the birth of their daughter, Maxima Chan Zuckerberg (\"Max\").[182][183] The couple announced in their Chinese New Year video that Maxima's official Chinese name is Chen Mingyu (Chinese: \u9648\u660e\u5b87).[184] They welcomed their second daughter, August, in August 2017.[185] Their Puli dog, Beast[186] has over two million followers on Facebook.[187] Zuckerberg has been very active in China. He has been a member of Tsinghua University business school's advisory board since 2014.[188] Raised Jewish, Zuckerberg once identified as an atheist, yet has since revised his views. In 2016, he said: \"I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.\u201d[20][189][190]",

Zuckerberg is known for co-founding and leading Facebook, Inc. and its namesake social networking website as its chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.[3][4] He also co-founded and is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot.[5]\nBorn in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[6] Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His net worth is estimated to be $74 billion as of December 2019, increasing over the past year with Facebook stock as a whole.[7] In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of 2019, he is the only person under 50 in the Forbes ten richest people list, and the only one under 40 in the Top 20 Billionaires list.[8]\nSince 2010, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year award.[9][10][11] In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.[12]\nZuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York.[13] His parents are Karen (n\u00e9e Kempner), a psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist.[14] He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna and Arielle, were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester County village about 21 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.[15] Zuckerberg was raised in a Reform Jewish household,[16][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and his ancestors hailed from Germany, Austria and Poland.[17] He had a Star Wars themed Bar Mitzvah when he turned 13[16][18] and once \"questioned things\" before deciding \"religion is very important\".[19]\nAt Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classes. After two years, he transferred to the private school Phillips Exeter Academy, where he won prizes in mathematics, astronomy, physics, and classical studies. In his youth, he also attended the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth summer camp. On his college application, Zuckerberg stated that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.[20][21][22]\nZuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called \"ZuckNet\" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a \"primitive\" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.[23][24]\nAccording to writer Jose Antonio Vargas, \"some kids played computer games. Mark created them.\" Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: \"I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it.\" Vargas notes that Zuckerberg was not, however, a typical \"geek-klutz\", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was \"really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff\", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem Aeneid, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.[15]\nDuring Zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[25] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[26]\nVargas noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard, he had already achieved a \"reputation as a programming prodigy\". He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.[10][15][27] In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, \"he built the site for fun\". Hasit explains:\nWe had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was \"hotter\" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[28]The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was \"completely improper.\"[28]\nThe following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[29] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \"Thefacebook\", originally located at thefacebook.com.[30]\nSix days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.[31] The three complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response.[citation needed]\nFollowing the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.[32] The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares.[33]\nZuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete his project.[34] In January 2014, he recalled:\nI remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after\u2014I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, \"You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world.\" But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.[35]On May 28, 2017, Zuckerberg received an honorary degree from Harvard.[36][37]\nOn February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room.[39][40] An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, \"The Photo Address Book\", which students referred to as \"The Facebook\". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.[39]\nOnce at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a \"Harvard thing\" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They began with Columbia University, New York University, Stanford, Dartmouth, Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Yale.[41] Samyr Laine, a triple jumper representing Haiti at the 2012 Summer Olympics, shared a room with Zuckerberg during Facebook's founding. \"Mark was clearly on to great things,\" said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth user.[42]\nZuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to Palo Alto, California in Silicon Valley where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California.[43][44] They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: \"It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me.\"[40]\nHe restated these goals to Wired magazine in 2010: \"The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open.\"[45] Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook.[46] On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.[47] When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained:\nI guess we could\u00a0... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads\u00a0... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.[45]In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg \"clearly thinks of himself as a hacker\". Zuckerberg said that \"it's OK to break things\" \"to make them better\".[48][49] Facebook instituted \"hackathons\" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.[48] The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.[49] \"The idea is that you can build something really good in a night\", Zuckerberg told Levy. \"And that's part of the personality of Facebook now\u00a0... It's definitely very core to my personality.\"[48]\nVanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 \"most influential people of the Information Age\".[50] Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009.[51] In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesman's annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.[52]\nIn a 2011 interview with PBS shortly after the death of Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was \"focused on building as high quality and good things as you are\".[53]\nOn October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.[54] Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had around 34 million.[55] Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, claimed that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013.[56]\nOn August 19, 2013, The Washington Post reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.[57]\nAt the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion humans who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.[58][59]\nZuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, claiming that mobile represents the future of the company.[60] Zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries.[61]\nAlongside other American technology figures like Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook, Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the \"Internet czar\" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&amp;A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin Chinese; although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.[62]\nZuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&amp;A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could \"learn how to better serve the community\".[63][64]\nZuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook.[65] In June 2016, Business Insider named Zuckerberg one of the \"Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World\" along with Elon Musk and Sal Khan, due to the fact that he and his wife \"pledged to give away 99% of their wealth \u2014 which is estimated at $55.0 billion.\"[66]\nA month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang, was launched. i2hub focused on peer-to-peer file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications.[67][68]\nOn May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Platform, a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.[69]\nOn November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, eBay sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook,[70] taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.\nIn 2007, Zuckerberg was added to MIT Technology Review's TR35 list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[71] On July 23, 2008, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Connect, a version of Facebook Platform for users.[citation needed]\nIn a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the Internet.org project in late August 2013. He explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the five billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. Using a three-tier strategy, Internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to Zuckerberg. He stated in his post:\nThe world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.[59]To stay proven on the efforts of bringing in the concept of net neutrality, Zuckerberg met Narendra Modi, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at Silicon Valley, to discuss on how to effectively establish affordable internet access to the less developed countries.[72] As a token of initiation, he changed his Facebook profile picture to extend his support to the Digital India to help the rural communities to stay connected to the internet.[73]\nHarvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU).[74] They filed a lawsuit in 2004, but it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.[75]\nIn November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138, a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Facebook filed to have the documents removed, but the judge ruled in favor of 02138.[76]\nA lawsuit filed by Eduardo Saverin against Facebook and Zuckerberg was settled out of court. Though terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook. Saverin signed a non-disclosure contract after the settlement.[77]\nIn June 2010, Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a \"Draw Muhammad\" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly.[78][79]\nIn June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County, upstate New York, filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was Facemash, the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as \"completely frivolous\". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.[80][81]\nOn October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of \"tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars.\" Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them.[82] Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.[83][84]\nOn July 2, 2016, Israeli cabinet minister Gilad Erdan accused Zuckerberg of having some responsibility for deadly attacks by Palestinians against Israelis.[85] According to him, the social network was not doing enough to ban posts to its platform that incite violence against Israelis.[86] \"Some of the victims' blood is on Zuckerberg's hands\", Erdan said.[87]\nIn January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight \"quiet title and partition\" lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to purchase small tracts of land which they own. This land is contained within the 700 acres of land in the Hawaiian island of Kauai that Zuckerberg had purchased in 2014. When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits.[88][89]\nOn April 10 and April 11, 2018, Zuckerberg began testifying before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding the usage of personal data by Facebook in relation to the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data breach.[90] He has called the whole affair a breach of trust between Aleksandr Kogan, Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook.[91] Zuckerberg has refused requests to appear to give evidence on the matter to a Parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom.[92]\nA movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social Network was released on October 1, 2010, starring Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, \"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\"[93] Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a \"good guy\".[94] The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as \"big juicy fun\" rather than \"reportage\".[95] The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, \"I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling\", adding, \"What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\"[96]\nUpon winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg \"for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other.\"[97] Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:[98]\nOn January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was being hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they ever met.[99] Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, \"It was interesting.\"[100] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was \"nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him\u00a0...\" He adds, \"Mark has been so gracious about something that's really so uncomfortable\u00a0... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It's the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable.\"[101][102]\nJeff Jarvis, author of the book Public Parts, interviewed Zuckerberg and believes Sorkin made up too much of the story. He states, \"That's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts.\"[103]\nAccording to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at Fortune magazine and author of The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World, (2011),[104] \"the film is only \"40% true\u00a0... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie.\" He says that \"a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false\", and concludes that primarily \"his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet\".[103]\nAlthough the film portrays Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard, Zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs.[15] Kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is \"false\". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, notes that the \"image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated\u00a0... It is fiction\u00a0...\" He likewise dismisses the film's assertion that he \"would deliberately betray a friend\".[103]\nZuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of The Simpsons titled \"Loan-a Lisa\", which first aired on October 3, 2010. In the episode, Lisa Simpson and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing Bill Gates and Richard Branson as examples.[105]\nOn October 9, 2010, Saturday Night Live lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook.[106] Andy Samberg played Zuckerberg. The real Zuckerberg was reported to have been amused: \"I thought this was funny.\"[107]\nStephen Colbert awarded a \"Medal of Fear\" to Zuckerberg at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, \"because he values his privacy much more than he values yours\".[108]\nZuckerberg appears in the climax of the documentary film Terms and Conditions May Apply.[109][110][111]\nZuckerberg was parodied in the South Park episode \"Franchise Prequel\".[112]\nOn December 7, 2018, Epic Rap Battles of History released a rap battle between Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.[113]\nZuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to Diaspora, an open-source personal Web server that implements a distributed social networking service. He called it a \"cool idea\".[45]\nZuckerberg founded the Start-up: Education foundation.[114][115] On September 22, 2010, it was reported that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey.[116][117] Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg.[118] Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, \"The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate.\"[119] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.[119] The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.[120][121]\nOn December 9, 2010, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett signed \"The Giving Pledge\", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity.[122]\nIn December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan announced that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to \"advancing human potential and promoting equality\" in the spirit of The Giving Pledge.[123][124]\nOn December 1, 2015, they announced they would eventually give 99 percent of their Facebook shares (worth about US$45 billion at the time) to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.[125][126]\nOn December 19, 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, to be executed by the end of the month\u2014based on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. On December 31, 2013, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for 2013.[127] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity.[128]\nIn October 2014, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated US$25 million to combat the Ebola virus disease, specifically the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[129][130] in 2016, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announced that it would give $600 million to Biohub a location in San Francisco's Mission Bay District near the University of California, San Francisco, to allow for easy interaction and collaboration between scientists at UCSF; University of California, Berkeley; and Stanford University.\nOn December 1, 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan announced the birth of their first daughter Max, and in an open letter to Max, they pledged to transfer 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at US$45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, their new organization that will focus on health and education. The funds will not be transferred immediately, but over the course of their lives.[131][132] Instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and other tech billionaires have done, Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company. This has drawn criticism from a number of journalists.[133][134][135][136]\nOn August 28, 2017, Chan and Zuckerberg announced the birth of their second daughter.[137]\nIn 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County, New York, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as \"no preference\" on voter rolls, and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections, in 2008 and 2012.[138][139]\nZuckerberg has never revealed his own political views: some news outlets consider him to be a conservative,[140][141] while others consider him liberal.[142]\nOn February 13, 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Zuckerberg's particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools.[143][144] Later that year, Zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for Newark mayor Cory Booker, who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election.[145] In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a US$100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools.[146] In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.[147][148]\nOn April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg.[149][150][151][152] The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public,[153][154] yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.[155] In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or not buy Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of Zuckerberg ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform.[clarification needed][156]\nA media report on June 20, 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is \"just about tech wanting to hire more people\", the Internet entrepreneur replied: \"The bigger problem we're trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.\"[157]\nIn June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration. The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional.[158][159]\nWhen questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government \"blew it.\" He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.[58]\nZuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9, 2015 which said that he wants \"to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world\" in response to the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2015 San Bernardino attack.[160][161][162][163] The statement also said that Muslims are \"always welcome\" on Facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that \"as a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities.\"[164][165]\nOn February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten \"Black Lives Matter\" phrases on the company walls and had written \"All Lives Matter\" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but \"malicious as well.\" According to Zuckerberg's memo, \"Black Lives Matter doesn't mean other lives don't -- it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve.\" The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, \"means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's.\" Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.[166][167][168] New York's Daily News interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, \"Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure.\"[166]\nIn January 2017, Zuckerberg criticized Donald Trump's executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries.[169]\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie criticized Zuckerberg over Facebook's role in spreading religious intolerance in Sri Lanka.[170] Moulavi Zahran Hashim, a radical Islamist imam believed to be the mastermind behind the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, preached on a pro-ISIL Facebook account, known as \"Al-Ghuraba\" media.[171][172]\nZuckerberg met his future wife, fellow student Priscilla Chan, at a fraternity party during his sophomore year at Harvard. They began dating in 2003.[173][174]\nIn September 2010, Zuckerberg invited Chan, by then a medical student at the University of California,[175] to move into his rented Palo Alto house. Zuckerberg studied Mandarin in preparation for the couple's visit to China in December 2010.[176][177] On May 19, 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan married in Zuckerberg's backyard in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school.[178][179][180] On July 31, 2015, Zuckerberg announced that the couple was expecting a baby girl and revealed that Chan had experienced three miscarriages previously.[181] On December 1, Zuckerberg announced the birth of their daughter, Maxima Chan Zuckerberg (\"Max\").[182][183] The couple announced in their Chinese New Year video that Maxima's official Chinese name is Chen Mingyu (Chinese: \u9648\u660e\u5b87).[184] They welcomed their second daughter, August, in August 2017.[185]\nTheir Puli dog, Beast[186] has over two million followers on Facebook.[187]\nZuckerberg has been very active in China. He has been a member of Tsinghua University business school's advisory board since 2014.[188]\nRaised Jewish, Zuckerberg once identified as an atheist, yet has since revised his views. In 2016, he said: \"I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.\u201d[20][189][190]\n</body></html>"

Yiannopoulos is a former editor for Breitbart News and describes himself as a \"cultural libertarian\". Through his speeches and writings, he ridicules Islam, feminism, social justice, and political correctness.[9][10][11] Leaked emails have shown that Yiannopoulous's book, Dangerous, and many of his Breitbart articles were ghost-written by a Breitbart colleague.[12] Yiannopoulos worked for Breitbart from 2014 until 2017. During his time at Breitbart Yiannopoulos rose to prominence as a significant voice in the Gamergate controversy. In July 2016, he was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment.[13][14] He was permanently banned from Facebook in 2019.[15][16] According to hundreds of emails by Yiannopoulous leaked by Buzzfeed in late 2017, Yiannopoulos repeatedly solicited white nationalists, such as American Renaissance editor Devin Saucier, for story ideas and editing suggestions during his tenure at Breitbart.[12] The emails show that this was an effort to appeal to a racist readership through dog-whistling. Yiannopoulos has been accused of being an apologist for or supporting paedophilia. The allegation arose from several video clips in which he said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can be \"perfectly consensual\" and positive experiences for the boys.[17] Following the release of the video, Yiannopoulos was forced out of his position at Breitbart, his invitation to speak before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was revoked, and a contract to publish his autobiography with Simon & Schuster was cancelled. Yiannopoulos has said that he is not a supporter of paedophilic relationships and that his statements were merely attempts to cope with his own victimhood, as an object of child abuse by unnamed older men. Born as Milo Hanrahan, Yiannopoulos was born and raised in Chatham, Kent, England.[18] His father is of half-Greek and half-Irish descent. His parents divorced when he was a boy.[19][4][4] Raised by his mother and her second husband, Yiannopoulos has stated that he did not have a good relationship with his stepfather and has spoken of how his stepfather would beat him. He is described as a practising Roman Catholic, but has also said that he is Jewish; Yiannopoulos states his maternal grandmother was Jewish. As a teenager, Yiannopoulos lived with his paternal grandmother whose surname he later adopted.[20] Yiannopoulos was educated at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury from which he has said he was expelled. He attended the University of Manchester but dropped out before graduating; he then read English at Wolfson College, Cambridge, but was sent down (expelled) in 2010.[21] In 2017, Yiannopoulos was a U.S. resident alien on O-1 visa status. He married his long-term boyfriend in Hawaii, in September 2017. The couple prefer at present to keep the identity of his husband secret.[22] After he dropped out of university, Yiannopoulos initially secured a job at The Catholic Herald. In 2009, Yiannopoulos moved to technology journalism with The Daily Telegraph.[23] In November 2011, Yiannopoulos co-founded The Kernel.[24] In March, 2013, The Kernel was shut down amidst allegations of unpaid wages, at a time when Yiannopoulos was the Editor-in-Chief and sole director of the parent company, Sentinel Media.[9] It was reopened later that year under Kernel Media, with Yiannopoulos remaining Editor-in-Chief and having privately settled the previous debts.[24] In 2014, The Kernel was acquired by Daily Dot Media, the parent company of The Daily Dot. After the acquisition by Daily Dot Media, Yiannopoulos stepped down as editor-in-chief, although he remained an adviser to the company.[25][26] In 2014 Yiannopoulos started writing for Breitbart,[27] and in October 2015, the Breitbart News Network placed Yiannopoulos in charge of its new \"Breitbart Tech\" section. The site had six full-time staff, including an eSports specialist, and was edited by Yiannopoulos until his resignation on 21 February 2017.[28] In 2014 Yiannopoulos emerged as a \"lead actor\" in the Gamergate controversy through his work at Breitbart,[29] becoming one of the most vocal of Gamergate's supporters.[30] Yiannopoulos employed Gamergate as a basis for online attacks on women,[31] and his role in Gamergate allowed him to become one of the central figures in the mainstream growth of the alt-right.[32] Much of the work at Breitbart which brought Yiannopoulos to national attention was inspired by the ideas of neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In early October 2017, BuzzFeed News published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the alt-right and neo-Nazi movements. Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were Curtis Yarvin, a central figure of the neoreactionary movement; Devin Saucier, the editor of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance; Andrew Auernheimer, the administrator of neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer; and Baked Alaska, a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets.[3] The story also reported that Yiannopoulos had a penchant for using personal passwords with anti-semitic overtones, such as 'Kristall', a reference to Kristallnacht and 'longknives1290', a compound reference to the Night of the Long Knives and the Edict of Expulsion.[3] In a Breitbart article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as \"dangerously bright\". The Tablet stated that many of these intellectual backers write for publications it describes as racist and antisemitic, such as VDARE and American Renaissance. The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.[33] The Anti-Defamation League classifies Yiannopoulos as part of the alt-lite; a term used to distinguish individuals sometimes associated with the alt-right from those who are openly white nationalist and anti-semitic.[34] These accusations, as well as Yiannopoulos's support for Trump, have contributed to a feud between Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro, a Jewish conservative political commentator who refused to support Trump in the 2016 election. Shapiro accused Yiannopoulos, his followers, and other Trump supporters of racist and anti-Semitic behaviour. He criticized Yiannopoulos's attempts to distinguish between real racist or bigoted behaviour and trolling, stating that \"words have meaning\" and that the distinction that Yiannopoulos was attempting to make \"simply doesn\u2019t exist in objective reality\".[35] in 2017, Yiannopoulos was caught on camera singing \"America the Beautiful\" at a karaoke bar, where a crowd of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, including Richard B. Spencer, who cheered him with the Nazi sieg heil salute. Yiannopoulos has subsequently claimed that he did not see the Nazi salutes while he was singing, citing what he claimed to be \"extreme myopia\". According to the bartender who was working on the night of the incident, Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and their entourage came into the bar and asked to sing karaoke even though it had ended. When the bartender saw the Nazi salutes she rushed the stage and told Yiannopoulos and his friends to leave, at which point they began harassing her, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and \"Make America Great Again!\" According to her, Yiannopoulos was getting the others \"roused\".[36] Following these revelations, billionaire Robert Mercer ceased his support for Yiannopoulous and condemned him,[37] as did Yiannopoulous's former employer Steve Bannon.[38] In November 2019, Yiannopoulos released an audio-recording which appeared to feature Richard Spencer using using racist slurs against African Americans and Jewish people. The recording appeared to date from the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the murder of Heather Heyer. [39] Yiannopoulos has done a number of controversial tours. Beginning in 2015 with the \"The Dangerous Faggot Tour\", encompassing universities in the United States and Great Britain. Although few of his American speeches were cancelled, many were met with notable protest ranging from vocal disruptions to violent demonstrations. Yiannopoulos has also had visas denied or cancelled on a number of occasions.[40][41][42][43] In January 2017, Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Washington. The event sparked large protests.[44] A 34-year-old man was shot while protesting and suffered life-threatening injuries. A witness recalled seeing someone release pepper spray in the crowd, which triggered the shooting confrontation.[45] On 1 February 2017, Yiannopoulos was scheduled to make a speech at UC Berkeley at 8:00\u00a0pm. More than 100 UC Berkeley faculty had signed a petition urging the university to cancel the event. Over 1,500 people gathered to protest against the event on the steps of Sproul Hall, with some violence occurring. According to the university, around 150 masked agitators came onto campus and interrupted the protest, setting fires, damaging property, throwing fireworks, attacking members of the crowd, and throwing rocks at the police. These violent protesters included members of BAMN, who threw rocks at police, shattered windows, threw Molotov cocktails, and later vandalised downtown Berkeley. Among those assaulted were a Syrian Muslim in a suit who was pepper sprayed and hit with a rod by a protester who said \"You look like a Nazi\", and a woman who was pepper sprayed while being interviewed by a TV reporter.[46] Citing security concerns, the UC Police Department cancelled the event. One person was arrested for failure to disperse, and there was about $100,000 in damage. The police were criticised for their \"hands off\" policy whereby they did not arrest any of the demonstrators who committed assault, vandalism, or arson.[47][48] Berkeley police reported at least 11 arrests, but no injuries or damage to buildings. UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said afterwards that the media event amounted to \"the most expensive photo op in the university's history.\"[49][50] In November 2017, Yiannopoulos began a tour of Australia, visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Adelaide and Perth. During the Adelaide show, Yiannopoulos stirred controversy by projecting an unflattering photo of the feminist writer Clementine Ford, taken when she was a teenager, with the words \"UNFUCKABLE\" superimposed over the top. During events in Melbourne he again stirred controversy when he described Australian Aboriginal art as \"crap\" and \"really shit\". There was violence outside his Melbourne events as protesters from the left-aligned Campaign Against Racism and Fascism and the right-wing True Blue Crew clashed. Seven people were arrested after clashing with police and outside the venue for Yiannopoulos's Sydney event. Yiannopoulos claimed the violence was caused by \"the left, showing up, being violent to stop freedom of speech\".[51] Yiannopoulos published two poetry books under the name Milo Andreas Wagner. His 2007 release Eskimo Papoose was later scrutinised for re-using lines from pop music and television without attribution, to which he replied that it was done deliberately and the work was satirical.[8] An ghostwritten autobiography titled Dangerous was announced in December 2016. Yiannopoulos reportedly received an $80,000 advance payment from the book's planned publisher, Simon & Schuster.[52] It was intended to be published under their Threshold Editions. A day after its announcement, pre-sales for the book elevated it to first place on Amazon.com's list of best-sellers.[53][54] In February 2017 Simon & Schuster cancelled its plans to publish the book in the wake of the video and sexual-consent comments controversy that also led to CPAC withdrawing its speaking invitation and Yiannopoulos to resign from Breitbart. Yiannopoulos sued Simon & Schuster for 'breach of contract' and 'breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing', seeking $10\u00a0million in damages. He dropped the suit in February 2018.[55] In May 2017, Yiannopoulos announced that he would self-publish the book on 4 July 2017. Soon after the announcement, the book became the best-selling political humour book on Amazon. The book was a New York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestseller. The book further peaked at No. 1 on Publishers Weekly's nonfiction bestseller list and at No. 2 on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list.[56] Subsequent publications Yiannopoulos published the book Diabolical: How Pope Francis Has Betrayed Clerical Abuse Victims Like Me \u2013 and Why He Has to Go in 2018.[57] He stated \u201cThe main purpose of writing this new book was to talk about the homosexual cancer that has infected the Vatican\u2026\u201d The book repeated the discredited claim that paedophilia and homosexuality are linked. Yiannopoulos promoted the book through Michael Voris, a traditionalist Catholic, celibate bisexual and anti-LGBT activist.[58] In 2019, Yiannopoulos published \u201cMiddle Rages: Why The Battle For Medieval Studies Matters To America,\u201d an account of the state of medieval studies as an academic discipline in the United States. The book was covered in a May 2019 New York Times piece.[59] Yiannopoulos's self-published books How to Be Poor and How to Be Straight were also released in 2019. The former was released after the revelation of his alleged insolvency.[60][61] In December 2015, Twitter briefly suspended Yiannopoulos' account after he changed his profile to describe himself as BuzzFeed's \"social justice editor.\" His Twitter account's blue \"verification\" checkmark was removed by the site the following month.[62] Twitter declined to give an explanation for the removal of verification, saying that they do not comment on individual cases. Some news outlets speculated that Yiannopoulos had violated its speech and harassment codes, as with an instance where he told another user that they \"deserved to be harassed.\" Others worried that Twitter was targeting conservatives.[62][63] For his criticism of Islam after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub, his Twitter account was briefly suspended in June 2016. His account was later restored.[64] In July 2016, Yiannopoulos panned the Ghostbusters reboot as \"a movie to help lonely middle-aged women feel better about being left on the shelf.\" After the film's release, Twitter trolls attacked African-American actress Leslie Jones with racist slurs and bigoted commentary. Yiannopoulos wrote three public tweets about Jones, saying \"Ghostbusters is doing so badly they've deployed [Leslie Jones] to play the victim on Twitter,\" before describing her reply to him as \"barely literate\" and then calling her a \"black dude\". Multiple media outlets have described Yiannopoulos' tweets as encouraging the abuse directed at Jones. Yiannopoulos was then permanently banned by Twitter for what the company cited as \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others\". He later stated that he was banned because of his conservative beliefs.[65] In May 2019, Yiannopoulos and several other influential people in politics and culture, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and conspiracy theorists and fellow right-wing pundits Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, were permanently banned from Facebook, which called them \"dangerous.\" \"We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,\" a Facebook spokesperson said. \"The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.\"[66] In January 2016, Yiannopoulos set up his Privilege Grant for white men to balance scholarships for women and minorities. He participated in an online telethon to raise money for the grant and in August 2016, reported that approximately $100,000 had been received in donations and a further $250,000 had been pledged. In August 2016, it was revealed that over a quarter of a million dollars had gone missing from the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant. Yiannopoulos apologised for mismanaging the grant and denied speculation he had spent the money. In March 2018, Yiannopoulos confirmed that the fund had been closed down.[67] In February 2017, it was announced that Yiannopoulos would address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). A conservative website, Reagan Battalion, then posted video of 2015 and 2016 clips of YouTube interviews at the request of a 16-year-old Canadian student who was opposed to Yiannopoulos' CPAC address. In the interview in a January 2016 episode of the podcast Drunken Peasants, Yiannopoulos stated that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can \"happen perfectly consensually\", because some 13-year-olds are, in his view, sexually and emotionally mature enough to consent to sex with adults; he spoke favourably both of gay 13-year-old boys having sex with adult men and straight 13-year-old boys having sex with adult women. He used his own experience as an example, saying he was mature enough to be capable of giving consent at a young age. He also stated that \"paedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature\" but rather that \"paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.\" Later in the interview, after his previous comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: \"I think the age of consent law is probably about right, that is probably roughly the right age ... but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them.\"[68] Yiannopoulos subsequently held a press conference, at which he said he had been the victim of child abuse, and that his comments were a way to cope with it. He declined to identify his abusers or discuss the incidents in any detail. He characterised his comments as the \"usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour\", and dismissed the allegation that he endorses child molestation. He alleged that the video had been edited to give a misleading impression, and stated, \"I will not apologise for dealing with my life experiences in the best way that I can, which is humour. No one can tell me or anyone else who has lived through sexual abuse how to deal with those emotions. But I am sorry to other abuse victims if my own personal way of dealing with what happened to me has hurt you.\"[69] In response to the controversy, Simon & Schuster cancelled its plans to publish his autobiography in June 2017. Media outlets reported on 20 February that Breitbart was considering terminating Yiannopoulos' contract as a result of the controversy. Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart on 21 February, reportedly under pressure to do so.[70] Yiannopoulos was later criticized for attending Hollywood \"boat parties\" and \"house parties\" in which boys he described as \"very young \u2013 very young\" were sexually abused, but failing to report the abusers to the authorities or to identify them during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. When asked about this by Ryan Lizza of New York magazine, Yiannopoulos said he \"didn't check anyone's I.D.s.\" and that he \"had no idea what the ages of any of those people at the parties were.\" He stated that when he said \"very young\" he was assuming that they were sixteen or seventeen. He reiterated that he doesn't \"advocate for any illegal behavior\" or excuse it.[71] When, on 10 March, an additional video emerged in which he said on a 2015 episode of Gavin McInnes's show that child sexual abuse is \"really not that big a deal. You can't let it ruin your life,\" Yiannopoulos was criticized for mocking child sexual abuse victims by calling them \"whinging selfish brats\" for \"suddenly\" remembering they were abused, and \"suddenly\" deciding it was a problem, 20 years after the abuse occurred. He also stated that a disproportionate number of paedophiles are homosexual.[72] Commenting again on his child sexual abuse remarks, Yiannopoulos stated, \"I did say something in the course of that conversation that I didn't intend, and for that I apologized.\" He continued, \"I did it incautiously and I did it in sloppy language.\" He did, however add, \"If I want to joke about a priest who did whatever he did to me when I was younger, I'm entitled to do so.\"[73] In 2019, Yiannopoulos wrote an article in The Spectator defending convicted child sex offender and cardinal, George Pell.[74] On 26 June 2018, reports surfaced that Yiannopoulos had told at least two news organisations who had requested comments that he wanted vigilantes to shoot journalists. According to a reporter for the New York Observer, he wrote in a text message \"I can't wait for vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight\". Two days later, following a shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland in which five people were killed, Yiannopoulos denied that his comments were responsible, adding that his remarks were a joke. He later posted on Instagram that he sent the messages to troll journalists. On Facebook he wrote \"You\u2019re about to see a raft of news stories claiming that I am responsible for inspiring the deaths of journalists.\" and \"The truth, as always, is the opposite of what the media tells you.\"[75] In October 2018, following several instances in which pipe bombs had been sent to prominent Trump critics, Yiannopoulos posted the following comment on Instagram: \"Just catching up with news of all these pipe bombs. Disgusting and sad (that they didn't go off, and the daily beast didn't get one)\". After initially refusing to remove the comment when it was reported as hate speech, Instagram later deleted the post.[76] Yiannopoulos describes himself as a provocateur and \"the most fabulous supervillain on the Internet\" and a \"lovable rogue.\"[73] In the UK, Yiannopoulos supported the Conservative Party before applying to join the UK Independence Party in June 2018.[77] A supporter of Donald Trump, and compared to Ann Coulter, he has been referred to as the \"face of a political movement,\" but he says his real concern is \"pop culture and free speech.\"[4][78] Yiannopoulos is a frequent critic of Islam. Following the June 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, he claimed that all of Islam, not simply a small group of radicals, was responsible for mistreating women and homosexuals.[79] Yiannopoulos described social attitudes of Western Muslims as \"horribly regressive.\" He has attempted to distinguish his opposition to Muslim immigration into the West from racism.[80] After the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, Yiannopoulos said that he condemned the violence but wrote on Facebook that attacks like that happen \"because the establishment panders to and mollycoddles extremist leftism and barbaric, alien religious cultures.\" He was widely criticized for this description and banned from making an intended speaking tour in Australia in 2019.[81][40] Yiannapoulos is a frequent critic of feminism and \"dumpy lesbians.\" He has frequently written articles that have been criticised as misogynistic. In a Breitbart article titled, \"Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\", he asserts that the combined oral contraceptive pill causes women to become hysterical, sexually promiscuous and obese. He declared his birthday \"World Patriarchy Day\". In 2016, Yiannapoulos published a Breitbart article entitled, \"Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism Or Cancer?\" [4][82] [83][10] He describes feminists as \"easy to wind up\", is critical of the idea of a gender pay gap and claims that feminism \" has become \"a mean, vindictive, sociopathic, man-hating movement.\"[82] Yiannopoulos favours banning women from military combat units.[84] In January 2018, Yiannopoulos reported a fictitious news story, written by a spoof news-site, as being true. The article claimed that an English High Court had ruled that the National Health Service was legally obliged to offer cervical smear tests to men. Unaware that the story was satire, Yiannopoulos argued that the story exemplified the thinking of those living in 'feminist clown world'. Before reading out the article verbatim, Yiannopoulos insisted that he had researched the story and promised that 'this is real, I haven't just made this up'.[85] While Yiannopoulos is openly gay, he has described being gay as \"a lifestyle choice guaranteed to bring [gay people] pain and unhappiness.\"[86] In October 2017, he married his husband in Hawaii. That same month, he came out against the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, arguing it would violate religious freedom.[84][87][88] In 2017, Yiannopoulos reiterated his belief that homosexuality is a sin and denounced those (including clergy) who sought to change Church dogma on the issue. \"You don't see me disputing the Church's teachings on homosexuality...I wouldn't dream of demanding that the Church throw away her hard truths just to lie to me in hopes I\u2019ll feel better about myself,\" he said.[89] In August 2019, Yiannopoulos was grand marshal for a straight pride parade in Boston, organized by the far-right group Resist Marxism. The parade was ostensibly to celebrate heterosexuality.[90][91][92] In July 2019, during an interview with The Jewish Journal, Yiannopoulos described himself as a Zionist who believed Israel is a bastion of civilization in a region of Islamic tyrants. During the interview, Yiannopoulos advocated for a Jewish \"super-state\" in the Middle East, and endorsed Israeli and American forces \"assassinating every leader of Hamas\".[93] In 2009, Yiannopoulos organised the London Nude Tech Calendar, which is a calendar featuring members of the London technology scene for the purpose to raise money for an organisation called Take Heart India.[94] Yiannopoulos hosted an event known as the Young Rewired State competition in 2010, which is an initiative to showcase the technological talents of 15\u201318-year-olds.[95] In December 2018, The Guardian reported that documents assembled by his former Australian tour promoters, Australian Events Management, showed Yiannopoulos had accrued more than $2\u00a0million in unpaid debt. Yiannopoulos reportedly owed $1.6\u00a0million to his own company, $400,000 to the Mercer Family Foundation, $153,215 to his former lawyers, $76,574 to former collaborator and Breitbart writer Allum Bokhari, and $20,000 to the luxury brand Cartier.[96]",

Yiannopoulos is a former editor for Breitbart News and describes himself as a \"cultural libertarian\". Through his speeches and writings, he ridicules Islam, feminism, social justice, and political correctness.[9][10][11] Leaked emails have shown that Yiannopoulous's book, Dangerous, and many of his Breitbart articles were ghost-written by a Breitbart colleague.[12]\nYiannopoulos worked for Breitbart from 2014 until 2017. During his time at Breitbart Yiannopoulos rose to prominence as a significant voice in the Gamergate controversy. In July 2016, he was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment.[13][14] He was permanently banned from Facebook in 2019.[15][16]\nAccording to hundreds of emails by Yiannopoulous leaked by Buzzfeed in late 2017, Yiannopoulos repeatedly solicited white nationalists, such as American Renaissance editor Devin Saucier, for story ideas and editing suggestions during his tenure at Breitbart.[12] The emails show that this was an effort to appeal to a racist readership through dog-whistling.\nYiannopoulos has been accused of being an apologist for or supporting paedophilia. The allegation arose from several video clips in which he said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can be \"perfectly consensual\" and positive experiences for the boys.[17] Following the release of the video, Yiannopoulos was forced out of his position at Breitbart, his invitation to speak before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was revoked, and a contract to publish his autobiography with Simon &amp; Schuster was cancelled. Yiannopoulos has said that he is not a supporter of paedophilic relationships and that his statements were merely attempts to cope with his own victimhood, as an object of child abuse by unnamed older men.\nBorn as Milo Hanrahan, Yiannopoulos was  born and raised in  Chatham,  Kent, England.[18] His father is of half-Greek and half-Irish descent. His parents divorced when he was a boy.[19][4][4]\nRaised by his mother and her second husband, Yiannopoulos has stated that he did not have a good relationship with his stepfather and has spoken of how his stepfather would beat him. He is described as a practising Roman Catholic, but has also said that he is Jewish; Yiannopoulos states his maternal grandmother was Jewish. As a teenager, Yiannopoulos lived with his paternal grandmother whose surname he later adopted.[20]\nYiannopoulos was educated at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury from which he has said he was expelled. He attended the University of Manchester but dropped out before graduating; he then read English at Wolfson College, Cambridge, but was sent down (expelled) in 2010.[21]\nIn 2017, Yiannopoulos was a U.S. resident alien on O-1 visa status. He married his long-term boyfriend in Hawaii, in September 2017. The couple prefer at present to keep the identity of his husband secret.[22]\nAfter he dropped out of university, Yiannopoulos initially secured a job at The Catholic Herald. In 2009, Yiannopoulos moved to technology journalism with The Daily Telegraph.[23]\nIn November 2011, Yiannopoulos co-founded The Kernel.[24] In March, 2013, The Kernel was shut down amidst allegations of unpaid wages, at a time when Yiannopoulos was the Editor-in-Chief and sole director of the parent company, Sentinel Media.[9] It was reopened later that year under Kernel Media, with Yiannopoulos remaining Editor-in-Chief and having privately settled the previous debts.[24]\nIn 2014, The Kernel was acquired by Daily Dot Media, the parent company of The Daily Dot. After the acquisition by Daily Dot Media, Yiannopoulos stepped down as editor-in-chief, although he remained an adviser to the company.[25][26]\nIn 2014 Yiannopoulos started writing for Breitbart,[27] and in October 2015, the Breitbart News Network placed Yiannopoulos in charge of its new \"Breitbart Tech\" section. The site had six full-time staff, including an eSports specialist, and was edited by Yiannopoulos until his resignation on 21 February 2017.[28]\nIn 2014 Yiannopoulos emerged as a \"lead actor\" in the Gamergate controversy through his work at Breitbart,[29] becoming one of the most vocal of Gamergate's supporters.[30] Yiannopoulos employed Gamergate as a basis for online attacks on women,[31] and his role in Gamergate allowed him to become one of the central figures in the mainstream growth of the alt-right.[32]\nMuch of the work at Breitbart which brought Yiannopoulos to national attention was inspired by the ideas of neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In early October 2017, BuzzFeed News published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the alt-right and neo-Nazi movements. Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were Curtis Yarvin, a central figure of the neoreactionary movement; Devin Saucier, the editor of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance; Andrew Auernheimer, the administrator of neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer; and Baked Alaska, a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets.[3]\nThe story also reported that Yiannopoulos had a penchant for using personal passwords with anti-semitic overtones, such as 'Kristall', a reference to Kristallnacht and 'longknives1290', a compound reference to the Night of the Long Knives and the Edict of Expulsion.[3]\nIn a Breitbart article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as \"dangerously bright\". The Tablet stated that many of these intellectual backers write for publications it describes as racist and antisemitic, such as VDARE and American Renaissance. The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.[33]\nThe Anti-Defamation League classifies Yiannopoulos as part of the alt-lite; a term used to distinguish individuals sometimes associated with the alt-right from those who are openly white nationalist and anti-semitic.[34] These accusations, as well as Yiannopoulos's support for Trump, have contributed to a feud between Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro, a Jewish conservative political commentator who refused to support Trump in the 2016 election. Shapiro accused Yiannopoulos, his followers, and other Trump supporters of racist and anti-Semitic behaviour. He criticized Yiannopoulos's attempts to distinguish between real racist or bigoted behaviour and trolling, stating that \"words have meaning\" and that the distinction that Yiannopoulos was attempting to make \"simply doesn\u2019t exist in objective reality\".[35]\nin 2017, Yiannopoulos was caught on camera singing \"America the Beautiful\" at a karaoke bar, where a crowd of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, including Richard B. Spencer, who cheered him with the Nazi sieg heil salute. Yiannopoulos has subsequently claimed that he did not see the Nazi salutes while he was singing, citing what he claimed to be \"extreme myopia\". According to the bartender who was working on the night of the incident, Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and their entourage came into the bar and asked to sing karaoke even though it had ended. When the bartender saw the Nazi salutes she rushed the stage and told Yiannopoulos and his friends to leave, at which point they began harassing her, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and \"Make America Great Again!\" According to her, Yiannopoulos was getting the others \"roused\".[36]\nFollowing these revelations, billionaire Robert Mercer ceased his support for Yiannopoulous and condemned him,[37] as did Yiannopoulous's former employer Steve Bannon.[38]\nIn November 2019, Yiannopoulos released an audio-recording which appeared to feature Richard Spencer using using racist slurs against African Americans and Jewish people. The recording appeared to date from the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the murder of Heather Heyer.\n[39]\nYiannopoulos has done a number of controversial tours. Beginning in 2015 with the \"The Dangerous Faggot Tour\", encompassing universities in the United States and Great Britain. Although few of his American speeches were cancelled, many were met with notable protest ranging from vocal disruptions to violent demonstrations. Yiannopoulos has also had visas denied or cancelled on a number of occasions.[40][41][42][43]\nIn January 2017, Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Washington. The event sparked large protests.[44] A 34-year-old man was shot while protesting and suffered life-threatening injuries. A witness recalled seeing someone release pepper spray in the crowd, which triggered the shooting confrontation.[45]\nOn 1 February 2017, Yiannopoulos was scheduled to make a speech at UC Berkeley at 8:00\u00a0pm. More than 100 UC Berkeley faculty had signed a petition urging the university to cancel the event. Over 1,500 people gathered to protest against the event on the steps of Sproul Hall, with some violence occurring. According to the university, around 150 masked agitators came onto campus and interrupted the protest, setting fires, damaging property, throwing fireworks, attacking members of the crowd, and throwing rocks at the police. These violent protesters included members of BAMN, who threw rocks at police, shattered windows, threw Molotov cocktails, and later vandalised downtown Berkeley. Among those assaulted were a Syrian Muslim in a suit who was pepper sprayed and hit with a rod by a protester who said \"You look like a Nazi\", and a woman who was pepper sprayed while being interviewed by a TV reporter.[46] Citing security concerns, the UC Police Department cancelled the event. One person was arrested for failure to disperse, and there was about $100,000 in damage. The police were criticised for their \"hands off\" policy whereby they did not arrest any of the demonstrators who committed assault, vandalism, or arson.[47][48] Berkeley police reported at least 11 arrests, but no injuries or damage to buildings. UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said afterwards that the media event amounted to \"the most expensive photo op in the university's history.\"[49][50]\nIn November 2017, Yiannopoulos began a tour of Australia, visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Adelaide and Perth. During the Adelaide show, Yiannopoulos stirred controversy by projecting an unflattering photo of the feminist writer Clementine Ford, taken when she was a teenager, with the words \"UNFUCKABLE\" superimposed over the top. During events in Melbourne he again stirred controversy when he described Australian Aboriginal art as \"crap\" and \"really shit\". There was violence outside his Melbourne events as protesters from the left-aligned Campaign Against Racism and Fascism and the right-wing True Blue Crew clashed.  Seven people were arrested after clashing with police and outside the venue for Yiannopoulos's Sydney event. Yiannopoulos claimed the violence was caused by \"the left, showing up, being violent to stop freedom of speech\".[51]\nYiannopoulos published two poetry books under the name Milo Andreas Wagner. His 2007 release Eskimo Papoose was later scrutinised for re-using lines from pop music and television without attribution, to which he replied that it was done deliberately and the work was satirical.[8]\nAn ghostwritten  autobiography titled Dangerous was announced in December 2016. Yiannopoulos reportedly received an $80,000  advance payment from the book's planned publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster.[52] It was intended to be published under their Threshold Editions. A day after its announcement, pre-sales for the book elevated it to first place on Amazon.com's list of best-sellers.[53][54]\nIn February 2017 Simon &amp; Schuster cancelled its plans to publish the book in the wake of the video and sexual-consent comments controversy that also led to CPAC withdrawing its speaking invitation and Yiannopoulos to resign from Breitbart. Yiannopoulos sued Simon &amp; Schuster for 'breach of contract' and 'breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing', seeking $10\u00a0million in damages. He dropped the suit in February 2018.[55]\nIn May 2017, Yiannopoulos announced that he would self-publish the book on 4 July 2017. Soon after the announcement, the book became the best-selling political humour book on Amazon. The book was a New York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestseller. The book further peaked at No. 1 on Publishers Weekly's nonfiction bestseller list and at No. 2 on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list.[56]\nSubsequent publications\nYiannopoulos published the book Diabolical: How Pope Francis Has Betrayed Clerical Abuse Victims Like Me \u2013 and Why He Has to Go  in 2018.[57] He stated \u201cThe main purpose of writing this new book was to talk about the homosexual cancer that has infected the Vatican\u2026\u201d The book repeated the  discredited claim that paedophilia and homosexuality are linked. Yiannopoulos promoted the book through Michael Voris, a traditionalist Catholic, celibate bisexual and anti-LGBT activist.[58]\nIn 2019, Yiannopoulos published \u201cMiddle Rages: Why The Battle For Medieval Studies Matters To America,\u201d an account of the state of medieval studies as an academic discipline in the United States. The book was covered in a May 2019 New York Times piece.[59]\nYiannopoulos's self-published books How to Be Poor and How to Be Straight were also released in 2019. The former was released after the revelation of his alleged insolvency.[60][61]\nIn December 2015, Twitter briefly suspended Yiannopoulos' account after he changed his profile to describe himself as BuzzFeed's \"social justice editor.\" His Twitter account's blue \"verification\" checkmark was removed by the site the following month.[62] Twitter declined to give an explanation for the removal of verification, saying that they do not comment on individual cases. Some news outlets speculated that Yiannopoulos had violated its speech and harassment codes, as with an instance where he told another user that they \"deserved to be harassed.\" Others worried that Twitter was targeting conservatives.[62][63]\nFor his criticism of Islam after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub, his Twitter account was briefly suspended in June 2016. His account was later restored.[64]\nIn July 2016, Yiannopoulos panned the Ghostbusters reboot as \"a movie to help lonely middle-aged women feel better about being left on the shelf.\" After the film's release, Twitter trolls attacked African-American actress Leslie Jones with racist slurs and bigoted commentary. Yiannopoulos wrote three public tweets about Jones, saying \"Ghostbusters is doing so badly they've deployed [Leslie Jones] to play the victim on Twitter,\" before describing her reply to him as \"barely literate\" and then calling her a \"black dude\". Multiple media outlets have described Yiannopoulos' tweets as encouraging the abuse directed at Jones. Yiannopoulos was then permanently banned by Twitter for what the company cited as \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others\". He later stated that he was banned because of his conservative beliefs.[65]\nIn May 2019, Yiannopoulos and several other influential people in politics and culture, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and conspiracy theorists and fellow right-wing pundits Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, were permanently banned from Facebook, which called them \"dangerous.\" \"We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,\" a Facebook spokesperson said. \"The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.\"[66]\nIn January 2016, Yiannopoulos set up his Privilege Grant for white men to balance scholarships for women and minorities. He participated in an online telethon to raise money for the grant and in August 2016, reported that approximately $100,000 had been received in donations and a further $250,000 had been pledged.\nIn August 2016, it was revealed that over a quarter of a million dollars had gone missing from the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant. Yiannopoulos apologised for mismanaging the grant and denied speculation he had spent the money. In March 2018, Yiannopoulos confirmed that the fund had been closed down.[67]\nIn February 2017, it was announced that Yiannopoulos would address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). A conservative website, Reagan Battalion, then posted video of 2015 and 2016 clips of YouTube interviews at the request of a 16-year-old Canadian student who was opposed to Yiannopoulos' CPAC address.\nIn the interview in a January 2016 episode of the podcast Drunken Peasants, Yiannopoulos stated that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can \"happen perfectly consensually\", because some 13-year-olds are, in his view, sexually and emotionally mature enough to consent to sex with adults; he spoke favourably both of gay 13-year-old boys having sex with adult men and straight 13-year-old boys having sex with adult women. He used his own experience as an example, saying he was mature enough to be capable of giving consent at a young age. He also stated that \"paedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature\" but rather that \"paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty.\" Later in the interview, after his previous comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: \"I think the age of consent law is probably about right, that is probably roughly the right age ... but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them.\"[68]\nYiannopoulos subsequently held a press conference, at which he said he had been the victim of child abuse, and that his comments were a way to cope with it. He declined to identify his abusers or discuss the incidents in any detail. He characterised his comments as the \"usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour\", and dismissed the allegation that he endorses child molestation. He alleged that the video had been edited to give a misleading impression, and stated, \"I will not apologise for dealing with my life experiences in the best way that I can, which is humour. No one can tell me or anyone else who has lived through sexual abuse how to deal with those emotions. But I am sorry to other abuse victims if my own personal way of dealing with what happened to me has hurt you.\"[69] In response to the controversy, Simon &amp; Schuster cancelled its plans to publish his autobiography in June 2017. Media outlets reported on 20 February that Breitbart was considering terminating Yiannopoulos' contract as a result of the controversy. Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart on 21 February, reportedly under pressure to do so.[70]\nYiannopoulos was later criticized for attending Hollywood \"boat parties\" and \"house parties\" in which boys he described as \"very young \u2013 very young\" were sexually abused, but failing to report the abusers to the authorities or to identify them during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. When asked about this by Ryan Lizza of New York magazine, Yiannopoulos said he \"didn't check anyone's I.D.s.\" and that he \"had no idea what the ages of any of those people at the parties were.\" He stated that when he said \"very young\" he was assuming that they were sixteen or seventeen. He reiterated that he doesn't \"advocate for any illegal behavior\" or excuse it.[71] When, on 10 March, an additional video emerged in which he said on a 2015 episode of Gavin McInnes's show that child sexual abuse is \"really not that big a deal. You can't let it ruin your life,\" Yiannopoulos was criticized for mocking child sexual abuse victims by calling them \"whinging selfish brats\" for \"suddenly\" remembering they were abused, and \"suddenly\" deciding it was a problem, 20 years after the abuse occurred. He also stated that a disproportionate number of paedophiles are homosexual.[72]\nCommenting again on his child sexual abuse remarks, Yiannopoulos stated, \"I did say something in the course of that conversation that I didn't intend, and for that I apologized.\" He continued, \"I did it incautiously and I did it in sloppy language.\" He did, however add, \"If I want to joke about a priest who did whatever he did to me when I was younger, I'm entitled to do so.\"[73]\nIn 2019, Yiannopoulos wrote an article in The Spectator defending convicted child sex offender and cardinal, George Pell.[74]\nOn 26 June 2018, reports surfaced that Yiannopoulos had told at least two news organisations who had requested comments that he wanted vigilantes to shoot journalists. According to a reporter for the New York Observer, he wrote in a text message \"I can't wait for vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight\". Two days later, following a shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland in which five people were killed, Yiannopoulos denied that his comments were responsible, adding that his remarks were a joke. He later posted on Instagram that he sent the messages to troll journalists. On Facebook he wrote \"You\u2019re about to see a raft of news stories claiming that I am responsible for inspiring the deaths of journalists.\" and \"The truth, as always, is the opposite of what the media tells you.\"[75]\nIn October 2018, following several instances in which pipe bombs had been sent to prominent Trump critics, Yiannopoulos posted the following comment on Instagram: \"Just catching up with news of all these pipe bombs. Disgusting and sad (that they didn't go off, and the daily beast didn't get one)\". After initially refusing to remove the comment when it was reported as hate speech, Instagram later deleted the post.[76]\nYiannopoulos describes himself as a provocateur and \"the most fabulous supervillain on the Internet\" and a \"lovable rogue.\"[73]\nIn the UK,  Yiannopoulos supported the Conservative Party before applying to join the UK Independence Party in June 2018.[77] A supporter of Donald Trump, and compared to Ann Coulter, he has been referred to as the \"face of a political movement,\" but he says his real concern is \"pop culture and free speech.\"[4][78]\nYiannopoulos is a frequent critic of Islam. Following the June 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, he claimed that all of Islam, not simply a small group of radicals, was responsible for mistreating women and homosexuals.[79]\nYiannopoulos described social attitudes of Western Muslims as \"horribly regressive.\" He has attempted to distinguish his opposition to Muslim immigration into the West from racism.[80] After the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, Yiannopoulos said that he condemned the violence but wrote on Facebook that attacks like that happen \"because the establishment panders to and mollycoddles extremist leftism and barbaric, alien religious cultures.\" He was widely criticized for this description and banned from making an intended speaking tour in Australia in 2019.[81][40]\nYiannapoulos is a frequent critic of feminism and \"dumpy lesbians.\" He has frequently written articles that have been criticised as misogynistic. In a Breitbart article titled, \"Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy\", he asserts that the combined oral contraceptive pill causes women to become hysterical, sexually promiscuous and obese. He declared his birthday \"World Patriarchy Day\". In 2016, Yiannapoulos published a Breitbart article entitled, \"Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism Or Cancer?\"\n[4][82]\n[83][10]\nHe describes feminists as \"easy to wind up\", is critical of the idea of a gender pay gap and claims that feminism \" has become \"a mean, vindictive, sociopathic, man-hating movement.\"[82] Yiannopoulos favours banning women from military combat units.[84]\nIn January 2018, Yiannopoulos reported a fictitious news story, written by a spoof news-site, as being true. The article claimed that an English High Court had ruled that the National Health Service was legally obliged to offer cervical smear tests to men. Unaware that the story was satire, Yiannopoulos argued that the story exemplified the thinking of those living in 'feminist clown world'. Before reading out the article verbatim, Yiannopoulos insisted that he had researched the story and promised that 'this is real, I haven't just made this up'.[85]\nWhile Yiannopoulos is openly gay, he has described being gay as \"a lifestyle choice guaranteed to bring [gay people] pain and unhappiness.\"[86]\nIn October 2017, he married his husband in Hawaii. That same month, he came out against the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, arguing it would violate religious freedom.[84][87][88]\nIn 2017, Yiannopoulos reiterated his belief that homosexuality is a sin and denounced those (including clergy) who sought to change Church dogma on the issue. \"You don't see me disputing the Church's teachings on homosexuality...I wouldn't dream of demanding that the Church throw away her hard truths just to lie to me in hopes I\u2019ll feel better about myself,\" he said.[89]\nIn August 2019, Yiannopoulos was grand marshal for a straight pride parade in Boston, organized by the far-right group Resist Marxism. The parade was ostensibly to celebrate heterosexuality.[90][91][92]\nIn July 2019, during an interview with The Jewish Journal, Yiannopoulos described himself as a Zionist who believed Israel is a bastion of civilization in a region of Islamic tyrants. During the interview, Yiannopoulos advocated for a Jewish \"super-state\" in the Middle East, and endorsed Israeli and American forces \"assassinating every leader of Hamas\".[93]\nIn 2009, Yiannopoulos organised the London Nude Tech Calendar, which is a calendar featuring members of the London technology scene for the purpose to raise money for an organisation called Take Heart India.[94]\nYiannopoulos hosted an event known as the Young Rewired State competition in 2010, which is an initiative to showcase the technological talents of 15\u201318-year-olds.[95]\nIn December 2018, The Guardian reported that documents assembled by his former Australian tour promoters, Australian Events Management, showed Yiannopoulos had accrued more than $2\u00a0million in unpaid debt. Yiannopoulos reportedly owed $1.6\u00a0million to his own company, $400,000 to the Mercer Family Foundation, $153,215 to his former lawyers, $76,574 to former collaborator and Breitbart writer Allum Bokhari, and $20,000 to the luxury brand Cartier.[96]\n</body></html>"

Bush was born in Pasadena, California,[2] the only child of Maureen Searson and Charles William Bush.[1] Her mother runs a photography studio,[3] and her father is an advertising and beauty photographer.[4] She graduated from Westridge School for Girls in 2000, where she was a member of the volleyball team. At Westridge, she was required to participate in the theatre arts program. Bush stated: \"Part of my school's requirement was to do a play. I was really irritated because I wanted to play volleyball and I had to go and do this play. But there was a moment after the performance when I realized I had gone and been somebody else. I thought, 'If I could do this for the rest of my life, I am set.' It was like love at first sight.\"[5] At age 17, Bush was named the Tournament of Roses Parade Queen.[1][6] She attended the University of Southern California (USC) as a journalism major and in her junior year, she became the member and Social Chair of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.[1] Bush made her first big screen appearance in the 2002 film National Lampoon's Van Wilder opposite Ryan Reynolds. Following this, she made appearances in several television shows, including Nip/Tuck, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and the HBO film Point of Origin. In 2002, Bush was cast as Kate Brewster in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, though she was replaced by Claire Danes after a week of filming.[7] Jonathan Mostow, the director of the film, stated that he had replaced her as he felt she was too young for the role, but praised her talent as an actress.[8] In 2003, Bush landed the role of Brooke Davis in the WB television series One Tree Hill. Throughout the series, her character evolved from a trouble-making vixen to a fiercely loyal friend. After Bush gained mainstream fame, she became a spokesperson for high-profile brands. She has posed on the cover of several mainstream magazines such as Entertainment Weekly, Lucky, Maxim, Glamour, InStyle, and Zooey Magazine. She has also had several endorsement deals, such as for Ocean Pacific clothing.[9] Bush and her One Tree Hill co-stars were endorsers for MasterCard, Kmart, Chevy Cobalt and Cingular Wireless.[10][11][12] She directed three episodes of the series, including the penultimate episode of the ninth and final season.[13] In July 2006, Bush co-starred in the 20th Century Fox comedy film John Tucker Must Die, directed by Betty Thomas, opposite Brittany Snow and Jesse Metcalfe. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $60 million worldwide. That same year, she also starred in Buena Vista Pictures' supernatural thriller Stay Alive alongside Jon Foster, Frankie Muniz, and Adam Goldberg. The film, the first to be released by Hollywood Pictures in five years, opened at number three in the U.S. box office.[14] She played Grace Andrews in the 2007 remake of the classic horror film The Hitcher, starring opposite Sean Bean. In 2008, Bush co-starred alongside Kevin Zegers and Vincent D'Onofrio in Fran\u00e7ois Velle's independent film The Narrows, playing the beautiful, intelligent, and self-assured Kathy Popovich. Based on Tim McLoughlin's novel Heart of the Old Country, the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2008.[15] Three years later, she co-starred in the British romantic comedy film Chalet Girl, which was released in February 2011. In February 2012, it was reported that Bush had joined the cast of the upcoming CBS sitcom Partners.[16] Premiering on September 24, 2012, the series ran for a single season until November, when it was announced that the series had been canceled after six episodes.[17] The remaining seven episodes of the series' initial thirteen-episode order remain unaired in the United States, though they were later aired by various international outlets. In 2013, Bush starred in Passion Pit's \"Carried Away\" music video, which debuted on February 14.[18] That same year, she was cast in a main role in the television pilot Hatfields & McCoys, but the project failed to be picked up to series.[19] In August 2013, Bush joined the cast of NBC's Chicago Fire police spin-off Chicago P.D. as Det. Erin Lindsay.[20] The series premiered on January 8, 2014.[21] Bush also frequently appeared on the third Chicago franchise series, Chicago Med. In 2018, Bush provided the voice of Voyd, an aspiring superhero, in Pixar's film, Incredibles 2, the sequel to 2004's The Incredibles.[22] Bush became engaged to her One Tree Hill co-star Chad Michael Murray in May 2004,[23] and they married on April 16, 2005, in Santa Monica, California.[24] After five months of marriage, Bush and Murray announced their separation in September 2005.[25] In February 2006, Bush filed papers for an annulment, citing fraud.[26] Bush's petition was denied,[27] and she and Murray were instead granted a divorce in December 2006.[28] On her divorce, Bush later said: \"It devastates me now that I have been reduced to a Hollywood statistic \u2013 another joke marriage. I never expected to be married more than once...because I knew what I was getting into and will always believe in love.\"[29] In a January 2014 episode of Watch What Happens: Live, she stated: \"We were two stupid kids who had no business being in a relationship in the first place. To all the other co-stars who've worked it out, more power to you.\"[30][31] From 2008 to 2009, Bush dated her One Tree Hill co-star James Lafferty.[1][32] Bush also dated actor Austin Nichols,[1] confirming in May 2010 that they had been dating on and off for four years.[33] Nichols took the role of Julian Baker on One Tree Hill to be with Bush.[33] They ended their relationship in 2012.[32] Bush began dating Dan Fredinburg, a program manager for Google, in January 2013. They broke up in February 2014, citing the strains of their long-distance relationship as the cause.[30][34][35] Bush and Fredinburg remained friends afterward, and she noted that his 2015 death significantly impacted her.[36] On January 8, 2011, Bush's nine-year-old second cousin, Christina-Taylor Green, was fatally shot in the assassination attempt on Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona. Green was the youngest victim of the massacre, during which six people were killed.[37] Bush uses Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and her blog to raise awareness of world events and fundraisers in which she takes part. She is a part of fundraisers such as Fuck Cancer, Run for the Gulf, and Global Green Gulf Relief[38] and has been involved in political issues, including her support for Barack Obama's candidacy for president in the 2008 election. In February 2008, she made several appearances in Texas in support of the Obama campaign in the Democratic presidential primary election. Bush was joined in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Waco by fellow actor Adam Rodr\u00edguez. Touring mostly college campuses, they urged young voters to get involved politically.[39] In April 2009, along with stars Sarah Chalke, Jason Lewis, Alicia Silverstone, Jane Lynch, and Lance Bass, Bush appeared in the Funny or Die video \"A Gaythering Storm\", which parodied a National Organization for Marriage video objecting to same-sex marriage.[40] Bush is a staunch supporter of gay rights and, in May 2009, she showed up at a rally in protest of Proposition 8. She carried a sign stating, \"I DO support the freedom to marry\", and a shirt which had the words \"Legalize Gay\" across it. In an interview in January 2012, Bush said about the 2012 Republican candidates: \"I will not vote for a candidate who thinks you can 'pray away the gay,' I will not vote for a candidate who thinks that he has more rights to my uterus than I do, I will not vote for a candidate who thinks that it's okay to dump toxic waste in the ocean. I'm afraid for our country that people like this could even be thought of as the president. I live in a country where I believe all men are created equal, not just wealthy white guys. I believe all men, all women, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic background, you deserve the same rights.\"[41] In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Bush and others told the stories of the people killed there.[42][43] Bush set up a fundraiser intended to help people living in the area of the Gulf of Mexico affected by the environmental disaster of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which occurred on April 20, 2010. The actress has visited Louisiana and testified in interviews of the horror she felt when she visited those places.[44] The fundraiser is on the Internet through crowdsourcing website Crowdrise.com. The actress, to support the fundraiser, announced that she would be running a half marathon that following November, despite having asthma and a year-old knee injury.[45] Bush has additionally teamed up with Do Something to raise more environmental awareness among teens. She was chosen as the spokesperson to endorse the launch of eMission, a Facebook game with the social mission to engage America's youth in fighting climate change created through the joint efforts of Do Something and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Energy Star program.[46] In 2011, Bush won the Do Something Twitter Award for having spread the word via her Twitter account on how her followers could help with the cleanup after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[47][48] She was voted \"Fan Favorite\" by Facebook users on DoSomething.org.[49] In 2011, Bush also became involved in the Pencils of Promise organization, which builds schools and increases educational opportunities in the developing world.[50] In December 2011, Bush competed with other stars in the Mozilla Firefox Challenge, a one-month fundraising contest whose winner is granted $25,000 to put toward a favorite cause; she won the contest in January 2012.[13][51] In April 2013, Bush took part in Global Poverty Project's \"Live Below the Line\" campaign, which consists in living on $1.50 a day to raise awareness of extreme poverty around the world.[52] In 2013, Bush hosted a Prizeo campaign to raise funds for one of her favorite causes, I Am that Girl.[53] As part of the campaign, Bush offered donors a grand prize of the opportunity to skydive with her.[54] In 2014, Bush's foreword to Alexis Jones' debut novel I Am that Girl was released and distributed by accessories retailer Claire's.[55] In 2016, Bush was named to Oprah's SuperSoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders.[56] Bush is a founding member of the resistance movement Time's Up. Two of her contributions include creating a clothing line benefiting Planned Parenthood and giving a speech at the Women's March on January 20, 2018.[57] Sophia is also constantly using her social media platforms, such as Twitter, encouraging people to participate in the ongoing activism opportunities around the world. In the 2018 fight over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Bush was supportive of Christine Blasey Ford, and praised her strength throughout the controversy. Bush tweeted, \"To everyone saying 'why did they wait? The timing feels suspect,' etc. Just remember Bill Cosby. No one wanted to believe it about him. It was true. And he's going to prison. I'd wager more women victimized by Kavanaugh will come forward. Women feel safety in numbers #TimesUp\".[58] Bush's appearance has often been the subject of media attention. Ranked #3 on Femme Fatales: The 50 Sexiest Women of 2004 and Named #15 on Much Music's 20 Hottest Women of 2004.[59] In April 2007, she ranked No. 90 in the British popular men's magazine FHM, in their countdown of 100 Sexiest Women of 2007.[59] Subsequently, she ranked No. 89 in the U.S. edition of the same magazine. In May 2007, Bush ranked high at No. 24 in the Maxim Hot 100 List of 2007.[59] She has also appeared on the cover of the November 2006 edition of Maxim with her One Tree Hill co-stars Hilarie Burton and Danneel Harris.

At Westridge, she was required to participate in the theatre arts program. Bush stated: \"Part of my school's requirement was to do a play. I was really irritated because I wanted to play volleyball and I had to go and do this play. But there was a moment after the performance when I realized I had gone and been somebody else. I thought, 'If I could do this for the rest of my life, I am set.' It was like love at first sight.\"[5] At age 17, Bush was named the Tournament of Roses Parade Queen.[1][6] She attended the University of Southern California (USC) as a journalism major and in her junior year, she became the member and Social Chair of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.[1]\nBush made her first big screen appearance in the 2002 film National Lampoon's Van Wilder opposite Ryan Reynolds.

In 2002, Bush was cast as Kate Brewster in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, though she was replaced by Claire Danes after a week of filming.[7] Jonathan Mostow, the director of the film, stated that he had replaced her as he felt she was too young for the role, but praised her talent as an actress.[8]\nIn 2003, Bush landed the role of Brooke Davis in the WB television series One Tree Hill. Throughout the series, her character evolved from a trouble-making vixen to a fiercely loyal friend. After Bush gained mainstream fame, she became a spokesperson for high-profile brands. She has posed on the cover of several mainstream magazines such as Entertainment Weekly, Lucky, Maxim, Glamour, InStyle, and Zooey Magazine. She has also had several endorsement deals, such as for Ocean Pacific clothing.[9] Bush and her One Tree Hill co-stars were endorsers for MasterCard, Kmart, Chevy Cobalt and Cingular Wireless.[10][11][12] She directed three episodes of the series, including the penultimate episode of the ninth and final season.[13]\nIn July 2006, Bush co-starred in the 20th Century Fox comedy film John Tucker Must Die, directed by Betty Thomas, opposite Brittany Snow and Jesse Metcalfe.

In February 2012, it was reported that Bush had joined the cast of the upcoming CBS sitcom Partners.[16] Premiering on September 24, 2012, the series ran for a single season until November, when it was announced that the series had been canceled after six episodes.[17] The remaining seven episodes of the series' initial thirteen-episode order remain unaired in the United States, though they were later aired by various international outlets. In 2013, Bush starred in Passion Pit's \"Carried Away\" music video, which debuted on February 14.[18] That same year, she was cast in a main role in the television pilot Hatfields &amp; McCoys, but the project failed to be picked up to series.[19]\nIn August 2013, Bush joined the cast of NBC's Chicago Fire police spin-off Chicago P.D. as Det. Erin Lindsay.[20] The series premiered on January 8, 2014.[21] Bush also frequently appeared on the third Chicago franchise series, Chicago Med.\nIn 2018, Bush provided the voice of Voyd, an aspiring superhero, in Pixar's film, Incredibles 2, the sequel to 2004's The Incredibles.[22]\nBush became engaged to her One Tree Hill co-star Chad Michael Murray in May 2004,[23] and they married on April 16, 2005, in Santa Monica, California.[24] After five months of marriage, Bush and Murray announced their separation in September 2005.[25] In February 2006, Bush filed papers for an annulment, citing fraud.[26] Bush's petition was denied,[27] and she and Murray were instead granted a divorce in December 2006.[28] On her divorce, Bush later said: \"It devastates me now that I have been reduced to a Hollywood statistic \u2013 another joke marriage. I never expected to be married more than once...because I knew what I was getting into and will always believe in love.\"[29] In a January 2014 episode of Watch What Happens: Live, she stated: \"We were two stupid kids who had no business being in a relationship in the first place. To all the other co-stars who've worked it out, more power to you.\"[30][31]\nFrom 2008 to 2009, Bush dated her One Tree Hill co-star James Lafferty.[1][32] Bush also dated actor Austin Nichols,[1] confirming in May 2010 that they had been dating on and off for four years.[33] Nichols took the role of Julian Baker on One Tree Hill to be with Bush.[33] They ended their relationship in 2012.[32] Bush began dating Dan Fredinburg, a program manager for Google, in January 2013.

She carried a sign stating, \"I DO support the freedom to marry\", and a shirt which had the words \"Legalize Gay\" across it. In an interview in January 2012, Bush said about the 2012 Republican candidates: \"I will not vote for a candidate who thinks you can 'pray away the gay,' I will not vote for a candidate who thinks that he has more rights to my uterus than I do, I will not vote for a candidate who thinks that it's okay to dump toxic waste in the ocean. I'm afraid for our country that people like this could even be thought of as the president. I live in a country where I believe all men are created equal, not just wealthy white guys. I believe all men, all women, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic background, you deserve the same rights.\"[41] In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Bush and others told the stories of the people killed there.[42][43]\nBush set up a fundraiser intended to help people living in the area of the Gulf of Mexico affected by the environmental disaster of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which occurred on April 20, 2010. The actress has visited Louisiana and testified in interviews of the horror she felt when she visited those places.[44] The fundraiser is on the Internet through crowdsourcing website Crowdrise.com. The actress, to support the fundraiser, announced that she would be running a half marathon that following November, despite having asthma and a year-old knee injury.[45] Bush has additionally teamed up with Do Something to raise more environmental awareness among teens. She was chosen as the spokesperson to endorse the launch of eMission, a Facebook game with the social mission to engage America's youth in fighting climate change created through the joint efforts of Do Something and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Energy Star program.[46]\nIn 2011, Bush won the Do Something Twitter Award for having spread the word via her Twitter account on how her followers could help with the cleanup after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[47][48] She was voted \"Fan Favorite\" by Facebook users on DoSomething.org.[49] In 2011, Bush also became involved in the Pencils of Promise organization, which builds schools and increases educational opportunities in the developing world.[50] In December 2011, Bush competed with other stars in the Mozilla Firefox Challenge, a one-month fundraising contest whose winner is granted $25,000 to put toward a favorite cause; she won the contest in January 2012.[13][51] In April 2013, Bush took part in Global Poverty Project's \"Live Below the Line\" campaign, which consists in living on $1.50 a day to raise awareness of extreme poverty around the world.[52]\nIn 2013, Bush hosted a Prizeo campaign to raise funds for one of her favorite causes, I Am that Girl.[53] As part of the campaign, Bush offered donors a grand prize of the opportunity to skydive with her.[54] In 2014, Bush's foreword to Alexis Jones' debut novel I Am that Girl was released and distributed by accessories retailer Claire's.[55] In 2016, Bush was named to Oprah's SuperSoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders.[56]\nBush is a founding member of the resistance movement Time's Up. Two of her contributions include creating a clothing line benefiting Planned Parenthood and giving a speech at the Women's March on January 20, 2018.[57] Sophia is also constantly using her social media platforms, such as Twitter, encouraging people to participate in the ongoing activism opportunities around the world.\nIn the 2018 fight over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Bush was supportive of Christine Blasey Ford, and praised her strength throughout the controversy. Bush tweeted, \"To everyone saying 'why did they wait? The timing feels suspect,' etc. Just remember Bill Cosby. No one wanted to believe it about him. It was true. And he's going to prison. I'd wager more women victimized by Kavanaugh will come forward. Women feel safety in numbers #TimesUp\".[58]\nBush's appearance has often been the subject of media attention. Ranked #3 on Femme Fatales: The 50 Sexiest Women of 2004 and Named #15 on Much Music's 20 Hottest Women of 2004.[59] In April 2007, she ranked No. 90 in the British popular men's magazine FHM, in their countdown of 100 Sexiest Women of 2007.[59] Subsequently, she ranked No. 89 in the U.S. edition of the same magazine.

                "text": "no title\n\nWentworth Earl Miller III (born 2 June 1972)[1] is a British-American actor and screenwriter. He rose to prominence following his starring role as Michael J. Scofield in the Fox series Prison Break, for which he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama in 2005. He made his screenwriting debut with the 2013 thriller film Stoker. In 2014, he began playing Leonard Snart / Captain Cold in a recurring role on The CW series The Flash before becoming a series regular on the spin-off, Legends of Tomorrow. Miller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, to American parents.[2] His mother, Roxann (n\u00e9e Palm), is a special education teacher, and his father, Wentworth E. Miller II, is a lawyer and teacher, who was studying at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship at the time of Miller's birth.[1][3][4] Miller said in 2003 that his father is black and his mother is white.[5] His father is of African-American, Jamaican, German, and English ancestry; his mother is of Russian, Swedish, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.[6][7] Miller's family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, when he was a year old.[4][8] He attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn, and graduated from Princeton University in 1995 with a bachelor's degree in English literature.[9] While at Princeton, he performed with the a cappella group the Princeton Tigertones and was a member of the Quadrangle Club and the Colonial Club.[10] In 1995, Miller relocated to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.[11] He has stated that his rocky road to stardom \"was a long time in the coming and there were a lot of upsets and a lot of failures and roadblocks, but I couldn't walk away from it. I needed it like I needed air, it was just something I had to do.\"[12] Miller's first TV appearance was as student-turned-sea monster Gage Petronzi on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (\"Go Fish\", 1998). Miller's first starring role was in 2002 as the sensitive, introverted David Scott in ABC's mini-series Dinotopia. After appearing in a few minor television roles, he moved on to co-star in the 2003 film The Human Stain, playing the younger version of the Anthony Hopkins character, Coleman Silk. He identified strongly with the core dilemma of the movie, about a black man who chooses to \"pass\" as white. Miller worked extensively on the role, not only in researching Anthony Hopkins, but by embarking on a four-month regimen to accurately portray Silk as a boxer. Also in 2003, he had a minor role in the film Underworld, playing a doctor and friend of the character Michael Corvin. In 2005, Miller was cast as Michael Scofield in Fox Network's television drama Prison Break. He played the role of a caring brother who created an elaborate scheme to help his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) escape death row after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. His character had a full upper body (front and back) tattoo. Covering both the front of Miller's torso and his back, along with both arms from shoulders to wrists, the special effects for the tattoo took over four hours to apply. His performance in the show earned him a 2005 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series.[13] The show was finished in 2009 after four seasons, but a new nine-episode fifth season was released April 4, 2017, with Miller reprising his role. Miller appeared in two Mariah Carey music videos, \"It's Like That\" as a party guest and \"We Belong Together\" as her love interest. Director Brett Ratner, who directed the pilot episode of Prison Break, was also signed on to direct the two Carey videos. Ratner decided to use Miller in the videos as well.[14] In addition, Miller guest-starred in the Season 11 premiere of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Detective Nate Kendall, a detective from Precinct 24 of the New York City Police Department.[15][16] He also featured in Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth film in the commercially successful Resident Evil film series based on the video game series of the same name; Miller plays Chris Redfield, one of the protagonists of the video game series. Miller wrote the screenplay for the film Stoker, as well as a prequel to Stoker, Uncle Charlie.[17] He used the pseudonym Ted Foulke, later explaining, \"I just wanted the scripts to sink or swim on their own.\"[18] Miller's script was voted to the 2010 \"Black List\" of the 10 best unproduced screenplays then making the rounds in Hollywood.[19] The film is about a teenage girl who must deal with a mysterious uncle following the death of her father. Miller described it as a \"horror film, a family drama and a psychological thriller\".[20] Although influenced by Bram Stoker's Dracula, Miller has clarified that Stoker is not a vampire story.[20][21] Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt also influenced the film but only as a jumping-off point, from which the story takes a different direction.[20] Park Chan-wook directed, with stars Mia Wasikowska as the teenager, Nicole Kidman as the mother, and Matthew Goode as the uncle.[22] The film was released in 2013, and received generally positive reviews from critics.[23] In July 2014, it was announced that Miller had joined the cast of The CW superhero series The Flash in a recurring role as Leonard Snart / Captain Cold.[24] He made his first appearance in the fourth episode of the first season, and reprised his role on Legends of Tomorrow.[25] These shows reunited him with his Prison Break co-star Dominic Purcell, who portrayed Mick Rory / Heat Wave. Miller exited Legends of Tomorrow as a series regular at the end of season one, but signed a contract with Warner Bros. TV to continue portraying Snart simultaneously on multiple shows in the Arrowverse.[26] Miller wrote the screenplay for the 2016 horror film The Disappointments Room, produced by Voltage Pictures and Killer Films.[27] The film received negative reviews from critics.[28] He is reportedly in negotiations to write the screenplay adaptation of the novel The Story of Edgar Sawtelle by David Wroblewski which is set to be produced by Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks among others.[29] Miller lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has two sisters, Leigh and Gillian. He holds dual British and US citizenship by virtue of his birth in the United Kingdom to American parents.[21] In 2007, Miller denied to InStyle magazine that he was gay.[30] However, he came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website declining an invitation to attend the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival because he felt \"deeply troubled\" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens (referring to the Russian LGBT propaganda law, enacted the previous June, which banned \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\").[31][32] Miller wrote that he \"cannot in good conscience participate in a celebratory occasion hosted by a country where people like myself are being systematically denied their basic right to live and love openly\".[31] At the 2013 Human Rights Campaign Dinner in Seattle, Washington, Miller said he had attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager before coming out as gay.[33] He said: \"When someone asked me if that was a cry for help, I said no, because I told no one. You only cry for help if you believe there's help to cry for.\"[33] He discussed struggling in Hollywood as a closeted actor, and talked about how his involvement in the ManKind Project helped him learn about brotherhood, sisterhood, and being part of a community.[34] In a 2016 Facebook post, he revealed that he \"[had] struggled with depression since childhood. It's a battle that's cost [him] time, opportunities, relationships, and a thousand sleepless nights.\" He made this emotional post in reaction to a meme of himself which poked fun at his weight gain in 2010. Miller said that his weight gain was due to him finding comfort in food as he was suicidal.[35] Near the end of the post he provided links for organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Active Minds.[36] On October 17, 2016, Active Minds, a mental health charity, announced that Miller will be an ambassador for the organization.[37]",

He rose to prominence following his starring role as Michael J. Scofield in the Fox series Prison Break, for which he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama in 2005. He made his screenwriting debut with the 2013 thriller film Stoker. In 2014, he began playing Leonard Snart / Captain Cold in a recurring role on The CW series The Flash before becoming a series regular on the spin-off, Legends of Tomorrow.\nMiller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, to American parents.[2] His mother, Roxann (n\u00e9e Palm), is a special education teacher, and his father, Wentworth E. Miller II, is a lawyer and teacher, who was studying at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship at the time of Miller's birth.[1][3][4] Miller said in 2003 that his father is black and his mother is white.[5] His father is of African-American, Jamaican, German, and English ancestry; his mother is of Russian, Swedish, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.[6][7]\nMiller's family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, when he was a year old.[4][8]  He attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn, and graduated from Princeton University in 1995 with a bachelor's degree in English literature.[9] While at Princeton, he performed with the a cappella group the Princeton Tigertones and was a member of the Quadrangle Club and the Colonial Club.[10]\nIn 1995, Miller relocated to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.[11] He has stated that his rocky road to stardom \"was a long time in the coming and there were a lot of upsets and a lot of failures and roadblocks, but I couldn't walk away from it. I needed it like I needed air, it was just something I had to do.\"[12] Miller's first TV appearance was as student-turned-sea monster Gage Petronzi on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (\"Go Fish\", 1998).\nMiller's first starring role was in 2002 as the sensitive, introverted David Scott in ABC's mini-series Dinotopia. After appearing in a few minor television roles, he moved on to co-star in the 2003 film The Human Stain, playing the younger version of the Anthony Hopkins character, Coleman Silk. He identified strongly with the core dilemma of the movie, about a black man who chooses to \"pass\" as white. Miller worked extensively on the role, not only in researching Anthony Hopkins, but by embarking on a four-month regimen to accurately portray Silk as a boxer. Also in 2003, he had a minor role in the film Underworld, playing a doctor and friend of the character Michael Corvin.\nIn 2005, Miller was cast as Michael Scofield in Fox Network's television drama Prison Break. He played the role of a caring brother who created an elaborate scheme to help his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) escape death row after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. His character had a full upper body (front and back) tattoo. Covering both the front of Miller's torso and his back, along with both arms from shoulders to wrists, the special effects for the tattoo took over four hours to apply. His performance in the show earned him a 2005 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series.[13] The show was finished in 2009 after four seasons, but a new nine-episode fifth season was released April 4, 2017, with Miller reprising his role.\nMiller appeared in two Mariah Carey music videos, \"It's Like That\" as a party guest and \"We Belong Together\" as her love interest. Director Brett Ratner, who directed the pilot episode of Prison Break, was also signed on to direct the two Carey videos. Ratner decided to use Miller in the videos as well.[14]\nIn addition, Miller guest-starred in the Season 11 premiere of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit as Detective Nate Kendall, a detective from Precinct 24 of the New York City Police Department.[15][16] He also featured in Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth film in the commercially successful Resident Evil film series based on the video game series of the same name; Miller plays Chris Redfield, one of the protagonists of the video game series.\nMiller wrote the screenplay for the film Stoker, as well as a prequel to Stoker, Uncle Charlie.[17] He used the pseudonym Ted Foulke, later explaining, \"I just wanted the scripts to sink or swim on their own.\"[18] Miller's script was voted to the 2010 \"Black List\" of the 10 best unproduced screenplays then making the rounds in Hollywood.[19] The film is about a teenage girl who must deal with a mysterious uncle following the death of her father. Miller described it as a \"horror film, a family drama and a psychological thriller\".[20] Although influenced by Bram Stoker's Dracula, Miller has clarified that Stoker is not a vampire story.[20][21] Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt also influenced the film but only as a jumping-off point, from which the story takes a different direction.[20] Park Chan-wook directed, with stars Mia Wasikowska as the teenager, Nicole Kidman as the mother, and Matthew Goode as the uncle.[22] The film was released in 2013, and received generally positive reviews from critics.[23]\nIn July 2014, it was announced that Miller had joined the cast of The CW superhero series The Flash in a recurring role as Leonard Snart / Captain Cold.[24] He made his first appearance in the fourth episode of the first season, and reprised his role on Legends of Tomorrow.[25] These shows reunited him with his Prison Break co-star Dominic Purcell, who portrayed Mick Rory / Heat Wave. Miller exited Legends of Tomorrow as a series regular at the end of season one, but signed a contract with Warner Bros. TV to continue portraying Snart simultaneously on multiple shows in the Arrowverse.[26]\nMiller wrote the screenplay for the 2016 horror film The Disappointments Room, produced by Voltage Pictures and Killer Films.[27] The film received negative reviews from critics.[28] He is reportedly in negotiations to write the screenplay adaptation of the novel The Story of Edgar Sawtelle by David Wroblewski which is set to be produced by Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks among others.[29]\nMiller lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has two sisters, Leigh and Gillian. He holds dual British and US citizenship by virtue of his birth in the United Kingdom to American parents.[21]\nIn 2007, Miller denied to InStyle magazine that he was gay.[30] However, he came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website declining an invitation to attend the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival because he felt \"deeply troubled\" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens (referring to the Russian LGBT propaganda law, enacted the previous June, which banned \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\").[31][32] Miller wrote that he \"cannot in good conscience participate in a celebratory occasion hosted by a country where people like myself are being systematically denied their basic right to live and love openly\".[31]\nAt the 2013 Human Rights Campaign Dinner in Seattle, Washington, Miller said he had attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager before coming out as gay.[33] He said: \"When someone asked me if that was a cry for help, I said no, because I told no one. You only cry for help if you believe there's help to cry for.\"[33] He discussed struggling in Hollywood as a closeted actor, and talked about how his involvement in the ManKind Project helped him learn about brotherhood, sisterhood, and being part of a community.[34]\nIn a 2016 Facebook post, he revealed that he \"[had] struggled with depression since childhood. It's a battle that's cost [him] time, opportunities, relationships, and a thousand sleepless nights.\" He made this emotional post in reaction to a meme of himself which poked fun at his weight gain in 2010. Miller said that his weight gain was due to him finding comfort in food as he was suicidal.[35] Near the end of the post he provided links for organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Active Minds.[36]\nOn October 17, 2016, Active Minds, a mental health charity, announced that Miller will be an ambassador for the organization.[37]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nLogan Alexander Paul (born April 1, 1995)[2] is an American YouTuber, internet personality and actor known for his YouTube video content. As well as posting on his own YouTube channel, Paul has run the Impaulsive podcast since November 2018, which currently has over 1.8 million followers.[3] Paul gained a following in 2013, posting sketches on the video-sharing application Vine.[4] He registered his YouTube channel, TheOfficialLoganPaul, on October 18, 2013, where he started posting regularly following the closure of the Vine app.[5] He later created the Logan Paul Vlogs channel on August 29, 2015, which has since become his most subscribed YouTube channel.[6] As of January 2020, the channel has received over 20 million subscribers and 4.8 billion views, ranking as the 54th subscribed in the United States, and placing Paul among the top 140 subscribed channels on the platform.[7][6] As an actor, Paul's television and film work includes guest appearances on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Weird Loners, and roles in films The Thinning (2016) and The Space Between Us (2017).[8] Paul has also expanded his content into other avenues; he released his debut single, \"Help Me Help You\" in 2017, and in 2018, fought British YouTuber KSI in an amateur white-collar boxing match. The fight ended in a majority draw and has been labelled 'the largest event in YouTube history'. In the subsequent rematch, which was a professional bout, Paul lost to KSI by split decision. Paul has been involved in several controversies, most notably in relation to a visit to Japan, during which he filmed the deceased corpse of a man who had hanged himself and posted the footage on his YouTube channel.[9] He has English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Jewish ancestry.[10] Growing up in Ohio with younger brother Jake,[8] he began creating internet videos for a YouTube channel called Zoosh when he was 10 years old.[11] Paul attended Westlake High School, achieving the ranks of the The Plain Dealer's All-Star linebacker on the football team in 2012,[12] and qualifying for the state-level Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) 2013 Division I Wrestling Individual Championships.[13][14] By the time he attended college, his YouTube channel had attained a modest following via the platform Vine.[15] He majored in Industrial Engineering at Ohio University before dropping out in 2014 to pursue a career as a full-time social media entertainer in Los Angeles,[11][16] moving into an apartment complex in Los Angeles with other Vine stars.[8][11] Paul rose to fame as a member on the Internet video sharing service Vine.[17] In February 2014, he had over 3.1 million followers on various social media platforms.[18] By April 2014 he had attained 105,000 Twitter followers, 361,000 Instagram followers, 31,000 likes on his Facebook page and about 150,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel. A YouTube compilation video of his Vine work garnered more than four million views the first week it was posted.[15] In 2015 he was ranked as the 10th most influential figure on Vine, with his six-second videos earning him hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising revenue.[11] By that October, his Facebook videos alone had more than 300 million views.[8] In early 2015, Paul appeared on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.[19] He also appeared on the Fox TV series Weird Loners, where he appeared in the role of the Paul Twins. He starred in two episodes of the Freeform series Stitchers. In 2016, Paul starred in the YouTube Red movie The Thinning opposite Peyton List. In early 2016, Paul trained with drama coaches and the comedy troupes The Groundlings and Upright Citizens Brigade.[8] Paul wrote the screenplay for an adult comedy, Airplane Mode, which has been described as \"American Pie for Gen Z\", and by Paul himself as \"Expendables with Internet stars.\"[8][20] The film was originally planned to be released in 2017, but was eventually released on August 2, 2019 after being delayed. Paul was also involved in a number of advertising campaigns, including for Hanes, PepsiCo, and HBO.[8] In 2016, Comcast purchased a short form digital TV series from Paul called Logan Paul VS.[21] In February 2017, Dwayne Johnson released on his own YouTube channel, \"Logan Paul has been cut from, like, all of The Rock's movies\", a video starring himself and Paul, in which Johnson informs Paul that he has been cut from all of Johnson's films, and consoles Paul by making him the \"ambassador\" to his upcoming Baywatch feature film.[22] On November 23, 2017, Paul released his new single, \"No Handlebars\", a track based heavily around an interpolated sample of the song \"Handlebars\" by the American alternative hip hop group Flobots. The song was heavily criticized for its perceived sexual objectification of women, including a scene in its music video where Paul rides several women like a bicycle. Flobots frontman Jamie Laurie lambasted Paul for both the \"sexist\" lyrical content of the song and for unauthorized use of the sample, calling him the face of \"douchebag entitlement.\" Laurie would later go on to release a track with lyrics deriding Paul, titled \"Handle Your Bars\". Paul did not respond to Laurie's comments nor the backlash towards \"No Handlebars\", however, he has since deleted the song from YouTube.[23] On December 31, 2017, Paul uploaded a vlog to his YouTube channel depicting the recently deceased corpse of a man who had died by hanging himself in Aokigahara at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan, known as the \"suicide forest\" due to its infamy as a suicide site. Initially intended to be part three of his \"Tokyo Adventures\" series, Paul and his group had planned to camp in the woods, but in response to finding the corpse, decided to notify the authorities and cancel their plans. The video gained 6.3 million views within 24 hours of being uploaded.[9] Logan was also criticized for other misbehavior he was captured taking part in during the trip, including climbing onto a moving forklift at the Tsukiji fish market, removing his clothing on a crowded street, then proceeding to 'fight' with one of the people he was travelling with, and throwing a giant Pok\u00e9 Ball at passing citizens, including an officer of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.[24] Paul's video depicting the corpse and his group's reactions to it was criticized by celebrities and politicians.[25][26] In addition, Paul was accused by other members of the YouTube community of being insensitive to suicide victims.[27] Several petitions were made to Change.org urging YouTube to delete Paul's channel, the largest of which received more than 500,000 signatures as of January 12, 2018.[28] As a result of the backlash, Paul removed the video from his YouTube channel, following up with a written apology on Twitter on January 1, 2018. On January 2, 2018, a subsequent video apology was released to YouTube in which Paul describes his behavior as a \"coping mechanism\", asking his fans to stop defending his actions in the process.[29][30][31] On January 9, YouTube issued a statement via their Twitter account condemning Paul's video. In the series of tweets, they said, \"It's taken us a long time to respond, but we've been listening to everything you've been saying. We know that the actions of one creator can affect the entire community, so we'll have more to share soon on steps we're taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated again.\"[32] On January 10, YouTube announced it was removing Paul's channels from Google Preferred, its preferred ad program, and New World Order, the sequel to his YouTube film The Thinning, was placed on hold,[33][34] with the airing of Logan Paul VS. being halted as well. Paul was also cut from season 4 of the YouTube Red series Foursome and the role of Alec Fixler was terminated.[35] On January 15, Paul was seen at LAX by reporters from TMZ. Paul said that he has learned a lot from his mistakes and believes he has been treated \"fairly\". When asked whether or not he deserves a second chance, Paul replied, \"Everyone deserves second chances, bro.\"[36] In response, Paul donated $1 million to suicide prevention agencies, a quarter of which is going to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.[37] On February 4, Paul officially returned to his daily vlogs on YouTube, after taking a month-long hiatus.[38] YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said on February 12 that Paul did not violate YouTube's three-strike policy and did not meet the criteria for being banned from the platform.[39] In wake of the controversy regarding the suicide video, Maverick Apparel, a brand for juniors and children, threatened Paul with legal action for giving his clothing line a similar name (\"Maverick by Logan Paul\"), believing shoppers are confusing their line with Paul's, resulting in a deep decline in sales.[40][41] On February 9, 2018, YouTube suspended all advertising on Paul's channels due to his \"pattern of behavior\", referring to his participation in the Tide Pod challenge, removing a fish from his pond to \"jokingly give it CPR\", and tasering two dead rats.[42] His revenue was temporarily halted as a result,[43] and as a result of the suspension Paul broadcast live on Twitch for the first time.[44] Two weeks later, on February 26, YouTube restored ads on Logan's channel, however his channel was still on a 90-day \u201cprobation period\u201d during which time content from his channel was not eligible to be on YouTube's trending tab.[45] In January 2019, Paul remarked on his Impaulsive podcast, \"What is it, male-only March? ... We're gonna attempt to go gay for just one month.\" Paul received widespread criticism for implying that being homosexual is a choice, with LGBT+ organization GLAAD responding to Paul's statement on Twitter, writing, \"That's not how it works, Logan Paul.\"[46] In March 2019, Paul released what has been described as a Flat Earth mockumentary, exploring the Flat Earth Theory. In the video, Paul interviewed many self-proclaimed \"Flat Earthers\", and spoke at the 2018 Flat Earth International Conference, which took place in Denver, Colorado.[47] On February 3, 2018, following his white collar amateur boxing match with Joe Weller, British YouTuber KSI challenged Paul to a boxing match.[48] On February 24, 2018, it was announced that Paul and his brother would be fighting KSI and his younger brother, Deji, in two white-collar boxing matches.[49] The fight ended as a majority draw, with two judges scoring the fight even at 57\u201357 and a third judge scoring 58\u201357 in favor of KSI.[50] On September 4, 2019, it was announced that Paul would be making his professional boxing debut in a rematch against KSI, which would shown exclusively on DAZN.[51] The fight was scheduled to take place on November 9 at the Staples Center.[52] At the UK press conference for the rematch, Paul again stirred controversy as he accused KSI of having five abortions, before remarking \"Five babies dead. I might return the favour and kill you\". He received criticism from pro-choice abortion activists, who described his comment as 'horrific'; Paul responded saying \"I said something distasteful and insensitive\" but did not apologise for the incident.[53] The rematch, which consisted of six three minute rounds, resulted in a win for KSI via split decision, with two judges scoring the fight 57\u201354 and 56\u201355 for KSI, and one judging scoring it 56\u201355 in favor of Paul.[54] In October 2015, Paul lived in the same apartment complex on Hollywood and Vine in Hollywood, California as other social media celebrities including Amanda Cerny, Juanpa Zurita and Andrew Bachelor, with his roommates Mark Dohner and Evan Eckenrode. This proximity facilitated various collaborations on their respective videos.[17] In October 2017, Paul and Eckenrode relocated to an estate in Encino, California.[55] In July 2018, Paul and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D actress Chloe Bennet confirmed that they were dating,[56] having been close since July 2017 after having met on the set of Valley Girl.[57] They split in September 2018.[58] Paul is red-green colorblind. However, he has been parodied and criticized by YouTube personalities such as Ethan Klein and iDubbbz for faking his reactions in a video in which he used color-corrective glasses for the first time. Paul himself admits that he \"embellished\" and \"exaggerated [his] reactions\" to the glasses, but added that he \"did not lie\" about his impairment.[59] In February 2019, Paul claimed that he has brain damage, which he sustained from playing high school football. Paul claims it affects his ability to have empathy and a human connection with others.[60] When filming a video for his Vine channel,[when?] Paul attempted a stunt during which he landed onto a chair and damaged part of his right testicle.[61]",

As well as posting on his own YouTube channel, Paul has run the Impaulsive podcast since November 2018, which currently has over 1.8 million followers.[3]\nPaul gained a following in 2013, posting sketches on the video-sharing application Vine.[4] He registered his YouTube channel, TheOfficialLoganPaul, on October 18, 2013, where he started posting regularly following the closure of the Vine app.[5] He later created the Logan Paul Vlogs channel on August 29, 2015, which has since become his most subscribed YouTube channel.[6] As of January 2020, the channel has received over 20 million subscribers and 4.8 billion views, ranking as the 54th subscribed in the United States, and placing Paul among the top 140 subscribed channels on the platform.[7][6]\nAs an actor, Paul's television and film work includes guest appearances on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit and Weird Loners, and roles in films The Thinning (2016) and The Space Between Us (2017).[8] Paul has also expanded his content into other avenues; he released his debut single, \"Help Me Help You\" in 2017, and in 2018, fought British YouTuber KSI in an amateur white-collar boxing match. The fight ended in a majority draw and has been labelled 'the largest event in YouTube history'. In the subsequent rematch, which was a professional bout, Paul lost to KSI by split decision.\nPaul has been involved in several controversies, most notably in relation to a visit to Japan, during which he filmed the deceased corpse of a man who had hanged himself and posted the footage on his YouTube channel.[9]\nHe has English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Jewish ancestry.[10] Growing up in Ohio with younger brother Jake,[8] he began creating internet videos for a YouTube channel called Zoosh when he was 10 years old.[11] Paul attended Westlake High School, achieving the ranks of the The Plain Dealer's All-Star linebacker on the football team in 2012,[12] and qualifying for the state-level Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) 2013 Division I Wrestling Individual Championships.[13][14]\nBy the time he attended college, his YouTube channel had attained a modest following via the platform Vine.[15] He majored in Industrial Engineering at Ohio University before dropping out in 2014 to pursue a career as a full-time social media entertainer in Los Angeles,[11][16] moving into an apartment complex in Los Angeles with other Vine stars.[8][11]\nPaul rose to fame as a member on the Internet video sharing service Vine.[17] In February 2014, he had over 3.1 million followers on various social media platforms.[18] By April 2014 he had attained 105,000 Twitter followers, 361,000 Instagram followers, 31,000 likes on his Facebook page and about 150,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel. A YouTube compilation video of his Vine work garnered more than four million views the first week it was posted.[15] In 2015 he was ranked as the 10th most influential figure on Vine, with his six-second videos earning him hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising revenue.[11] By that October, his Facebook videos alone had more than 300 million views.[8]\nIn early 2015, Paul appeared on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.[19] He also appeared on the Fox TV series Weird Loners, where he appeared in the role of the Paul Twins. He starred in two episodes of the Freeform series Stitchers. In 2016, Paul starred in the YouTube Red movie The Thinning opposite Peyton List. In early 2016, Paul trained with drama coaches and the comedy troupes The Groundlings and Upright Citizens Brigade.[8]\nPaul wrote the screenplay for an adult comedy, Airplane Mode, which has been described as \"American Pie for Gen Z\", and by Paul himself as \"Expendables with Internet stars.\"[8][20] The film was originally planned to be released in 2017, but was eventually released on August 2, 2019 after being delayed. Paul was also involved in a number of advertising campaigns, including for Hanes, PepsiCo, and HBO.[8] In 2016, Comcast purchased a short form digital TV series from Paul called Logan Paul VS.[21]\nIn February 2017, Dwayne Johnson released on his own YouTube channel, \"Logan Paul has been cut from, like, all of The Rock's movies\", a video starring himself and Paul, in which Johnson informs Paul that he has been cut from all of Johnson's films, and consoles Paul by making him the \"ambassador\" to his upcoming Baywatch feature film.[22]\nOn November 23, 2017, Paul released his new single, \"No Handlebars\", a track based heavily around an interpolated sample of the song \"Handlebars\" by the American alternative hip hop group Flobots. The song was heavily criticized for its perceived sexual objectification of women, including a scene in its music video where Paul rides several women like a bicycle. Flobots frontman Jamie Laurie lambasted Paul for both the \"sexist\" lyrical content of the song and for unauthorized use of the sample, calling him the face of \"douchebag entitlement.\" Laurie would later go on to release a track with lyrics deriding Paul, titled \"Handle Your Bars\". Paul did not respond to Laurie's comments nor the backlash towards \"No Handlebars\", however, he has since deleted the song from YouTube.[23]\n\nOn December 31, 2017, Paul uploaded a vlog to his YouTube channel depicting the recently deceased corpse of a man who had died by hanging himself in Aokigahara at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan, known as the \"suicide forest\" due to its infamy as a suicide site. Initially intended to be part three of his \"Tokyo Adventures\" series, Paul and his group had planned to camp in the woods, but in response to finding the corpse, decided to notify the authorities and cancel their plans. The video gained 6.3 million views within 24 hours of being uploaded.[9] Logan was also criticized for other misbehavior he was captured taking part in during the trip, including climbing onto a moving forklift at the Tsukiji fish market, removing his clothing on a crowded street, then proceeding to 'fight' with one of the people he was travelling with, and throwing a giant Pok\u00e9 Ball at passing citizens, including an officer of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.[24] Paul's video depicting the corpse and his group's reactions to it was criticized by celebrities and politicians.[25][26] In addition, Paul was accused by other members of the YouTube community of being insensitive to suicide victims.[27] Several petitions were made to Change.org urging YouTube to delete Paul's channel, the largest of which received more than 500,000 signatures as of January 12, 2018.[28]\nAs a result of the backlash, Paul removed the video from his YouTube channel, following up with a written apology on Twitter on January 1, 2018. On January 2, 2018, a subsequent video apology was released to YouTube in which Paul describes his behavior as a \"coping mechanism\", asking his fans to stop defending his actions in the process.[29][30][31] On January 9, YouTube issued a statement via their Twitter account condemning Paul's video. In the series of tweets, they said, \"It's taken us a long time to respond, but we've been listening to everything you've been saying. We know that the actions of one creator can affect the entire community, so we'll have more to share soon on steps we're taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated again.\"[32] On January 10, YouTube announced it was removing Paul's channels from Google Preferred, its preferred ad program, and New World Order, the sequel to his YouTube film The Thinning, was placed on hold,[33][34] with the airing of Logan Paul VS. being halted as well. Paul was also cut from season 4 of the YouTube Red series Foursome and the role of Alec Fixler was terminated.[35] On January 15, Paul was seen at LAX by reporters from TMZ. Paul said that he has learned a lot from his mistakes and believes he has been treated \"fairly\". When asked whether or not he deserves a second chance, Paul replied, \"Everyone deserves second chances, bro.\"[36] In response, Paul donated $1 million to suicide prevention agencies, a quarter of which is going to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.[37]\nOn February 4, Paul officially returned to his daily vlogs on YouTube, after taking a month-long hiatus.[38] YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said on February 12 that Paul did not violate YouTube's three-strike policy and did not meet the criteria for being banned from the platform.[39] In wake of the controversy regarding the suicide video, Maverick Apparel, a brand for juniors and children, threatened Paul with legal action for giving his clothing line a similar name (\"Maverick by Logan Paul\"), believing shoppers are confusing their line with Paul's, resulting in a deep decline in sales.[40][41]\nOn February 9, 2018, YouTube suspended all advertising on Paul's channels due to his \"pattern of behavior\", referring to his participation in the Tide Pod challenge, removing a fish from his pond to \"jokingly give it CPR\", and tasering two dead rats.[42] His revenue was temporarily halted as a result,[43] and as a result of the suspension Paul broadcast live on Twitch for the first time.[44] Two weeks later, on February 26, YouTube restored ads on Logan's channel, however his channel was still on a 90-day \u201cprobation period\u201d during which time content from his channel was not eligible to be on YouTube's trending tab.[45]\nIn January 2019, Paul remarked on his Impaulsive podcast, \"What is it, male-only March? ... We're gonna attempt to go gay for just one month.\" Paul received widespread criticism for implying that being homosexual is a choice, with LGBT+ organization GLAAD responding to Paul's statement on Twitter, writing, \"That's not how it works, Logan Paul.\"[46]\nIn March 2019, Paul released what has been described as a Flat Earth mockumentary, exploring the Flat Earth Theory. In the video, Paul interviewed many self-proclaimed \"Flat Earthers\", and spoke at the 2018 Flat Earth International Conference, which took place in Denver, Colorado.[47]\nOn February 3, 2018, following his white collar amateur boxing match with Joe Weller, British YouTuber KSI challenged Paul to a boxing match.[48] On February 24, 2018, it was announced that Paul and his brother would be fighting KSI and his younger brother, Deji, in two white-collar boxing matches.[49] The fight ended as a majority draw, with two judges scoring the fight even at 57\u201357 and a third judge scoring 58\u201357 in favor of KSI.[50]\nOn September 4, 2019, it was announced that Paul would be making his professional boxing debut in a rematch against KSI, which would shown exclusively on DAZN.[51] The fight was scheduled to take place on November 9 at the Staples Center.[52] At the UK press conference for the rematch, Paul again stirred controversy as he accused KSI of having five abortions, before remarking \"Five babies dead. I might return the favour and kill you\". He received criticism from pro-choice abortion activists, who described his comment as 'horrific'; Paul responded saying \"I said something distasteful and insensitive\" but did not apologise for the incident.[53]\nThe rematch, which consisted of six three minute rounds, resulted in a win for KSI via split decision, with two judges scoring the fight 57\u201354 and 56\u201355 for KSI, and one judging scoring it 56\u201355 in favor of Paul.[54]\nIn October 2015, Paul lived in the same apartment complex on Hollywood and Vine in Hollywood, California as other social media celebrities including Amanda Cerny, Juanpa Zurita and Andrew Bachelor, with his roommates Mark Dohner and Evan Eckenrode. This proximity facilitated various collaborations on their respective videos.[17] In October 2017, Paul and Eckenrode relocated to an estate in Encino, California.[55]\nIn July 2018, Paul and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D actress Chloe Bennet confirmed that they were dating,[56] having been close since July 2017 after having met on the set of Valley Girl.[57] They split in September 2018.[58]\nPaul is red-green colorblind. However, he has been parodied and criticized by YouTube personalities such as Ethan Klein and iDubbbz for faking his reactions in a video in which he used color-corrective glasses for the first time. Paul himself admits that he \"embellished\" and \"exaggerated [his] reactions\" to the glasses, but added that he \"did not lie\" about his impairment.[59]\nIn February 2019, Paul claimed that he has brain damage, which he sustained from playing high school football. Paul claims it affects his ability to have empathy and a human connection with others.[60] When filming a video for his Vine channel,[when?] Paul attempted a stunt during which he landed onto a chair and damaged part of his right testicle.[61]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nChristopher Ashton Kutcher (/\u02c8k\u028at\u0283\u0259r/; born February 7, 1978)[1] is an American actor, producer, and entrepreneur. He began his acting career portraying Michael Kelso in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show (1998\u20132006). He made his film debut in the romantic comedy Coming Soon (1999), followed by the comedy film Dude, Where's My Car? (2000), which was a box office hit. In 2003, Kutcher moved into romantic comedies, appearing in that year's Just Married and My Boss's Daughter. In 2003, he created and produced the television series Punk'd, also serving as host for the first eight of its ten seasons. In 2004, Kutcher starred in the lead role of the psychological film The Butterfly Effect. Kutcher subsequently appeared in more romantic comedies, including Guess Who (2005), A Lot Like Love (2005), What Happens in Vegas (2008), and No Strings Attached (2011). He starred as Walden Schmidt on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men (2011\u20132015). In 2013, Kutcher portrayed Steve Jobs in the biographical film Jobs. Since 2016, he has starred as Colt Bennett in the Netflix series The Ranch. Beyond entertainment, Kutcher is also a venture capitalist. He is a co-founder of the venture capital firm A-Grade Investments. At SXSW on March 14, 2015, Kutcher announced Sound Ventures, the successor to A-Grade Investments managing a fund backed by institutional funding. Kutcher has also successfully invested in several high technology startups. Kutcher has investments in over 60 companies, the most prominent of which include Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb, Path and Fab.com. Kutcher has invested in five startups as of August\u00a02017[update]\u2014Neighborly, Zenreach, ResearchGate, Kopari Beauty, and Lemonade\u2014marking his foray into the \"insurtech\" sector. Kutcher was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Diane (n\u00e9e Finnegan), a Procter & Gamble employee, and Larry M. Kutcher, a factory worker.[2][3] He has Czech, German, and Irish ancestry.[4][5] Kutcher was raised in a \"relatively conservative\" Catholic family.[6] He has an older sister named Tausha and a fraternal twin brother named Michael, who had a heart transplant when the brothers were young children. [7] Michael also has cerebral palsy and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization Reaching for the Stars.[8] Michael's cardiomyopathy caused Kutcher's home life to become increasingly stressful. He has said he \"didn't want to come home and find more bad news\" about his brother, stating, \"I kept myself so busy that I didn't allow myself to feel.\"[9] Kutcher attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids for his freshman year, before his family moved to Homestead, Iowa, where he attended Clear Creek Amana High School. During high school, he developed a passion for acting and appeared in school plays and his parents divorced when he was 16. During his senior year, he broke into his high school at midnight with his cousin in an attempt to steal money; he was arrested leaving the scene. Kutcher was convicted of third-degree burglary and sentenced to three years of probation and 180 hours of community service. Kutcher stated that although the experience \"straightened him out\", he lost his girlfriend and anticipated college scholarships, and was ostracized at school and in his community.[10] Kutcher enrolled at the University of Iowa in August 1996, where his planned major was biochemical engineering, motivated by the desire to cure his brother's heart ailment.[3] At college, Kutcher was kicked out of his apartment for being too \"noisy\" and \"wild\".[11] Kutcher stated, \"I thought I knew everything but I didn't have a clue. I was partying, and I woke up many mornings not knowing what I had done the night before. I played way too hard. I am amazed I am not dead.\"[12] To earn tuition money, Kutcher worked as a college summer hire in the cereal department for the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids and sometimes sold his blood plasma.[13] While at the University of Iowa, he was approached by a model scout at The Airliner bar in Iowa City, Iowa,[14] and entered the \"Fresh Faces of Iowa\" modeling competition. Placing first, he won a trip to New York City's International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Convention. Leaving U of Iowa for a stay in New York City, Kutcher then returned to Cedar Rapids, before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.[11] After participating in an IMTA competition in 1998, Kutcher signed with Next modeling agency in New York, appeared in commercials for Calvin Klein, and modelled in Paris and Milan.[15] Following his success in modeling, Kutcher moved to Los Angeles after his first audition.[16] He was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series That '70s Show, from 1998 to 2006. Kutcher was cast in a series of film roles; although he auditioned but was not cast for the role of Danny Walker in Pearl Harbor (2001) (replaced by Josh Hartnett), he starred in several comedy films, including Dude, Where's My Car? (2000), Just Married (2003), and Guess Who (2005). He appeared in the 2003 family film Cheaper By The Dozen as a self-obsessed actor. In the 2004 drama film The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher played a conflicted young man who time travels. The film received mixed to negative reviews, but was a box office success.[10] In 2003, Kutcher produced and starred as the host in his own series, MTV's Punk'd, that involved hidden camera tricks performed on celebrities. He is also an executive producer of the reality television shows Beauty and the Geek, Adventures in Hollyhood (based around the rap group Three 6 Mafia), The Real Wedding Crashers, and the game show Opportunity Knocks. Many of his production credits, including Punk'd, come through Katalyst Films, a production company he runs with partner Jason Goldberg.[17] A 2004 interviewer described Kutcher as a \"hunky young actor [who] is heading in all different directions at once\", including \"the hot L.A. restaurant Dolce\": \"If anything, I'm a trier,\" says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. \"I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out\u2014if That '70s Show got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career\u2014I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week. It allows a lot of time for sitting around, which I always kind of filled with work.[18] Because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of The Guardian, Kutcher was unable to renew his contract for the eighth and final season of That '70s Show, although he appeared in its first four episodes (credited as a special guest star) and returned for the series finale.[10] Kutcher produced and starred in the 2010 action comedy, Killers, in which he played a hitman.[19] In May 2011, Kutcher was announced as Charlie Sheen's replacement on the series Two and a Half Men.[20] Kutcher's contract was for one year and was believed to be worth nearly $20 million.[21] His debut as the character Walden Schmidt, entitled \"Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt\", was seen by 28.7 million people on September 19, 2011. The Nielsen ratings company reported that figure was more than any episode in the show's first eight seasons, when Sheen starred in it.[22][23] Kutcher earned $750,000 an episode on the show.[24] The show ended with a forty-minute series finale \"Of Course He's Dead\" on February 19, 2015. Kutcher appeared as a guest Shark during the seventh season of reality TV show Shark Tank, which premiered on September 25, 2015.[25] In 2016, he appeared in the \"Candy, Quahog Marshmallow\" episode of Family Guy.[26] Since 2016, he has starred in the Netflix series, The Ranch, alongside Danny Masterson, Elisha Cuthbert and Debra Winger, playing the role of Colt Bennett, the son of a Colorado rancher (Sam Elliott) returning home from a semi-pro football career to run the family business on the ranch. Beyond the entertainment world, Kutcher has invested in several high technology startups.[27][28] Kutcher has invested in five startups as of August\u00a02017[update]\u2014Neighborly, Zenreach, ResearchGate, Kopari Beauty, and most recently, Lemonade\u2014marking his foray into the \"insurtech\" sector.[29] He is a co-founder of the venture capital firm A-Grade Investments with Guy Oseary and Ron Burkle and fund manager Chris Hollod. Kutcher, Oseary & Burkle started by initially investing $30m of their own funds in 2010 when they founded the firm, by 2016 Forbes valued the firms holdings at $236m[30]. At SXSW on March 14, 2015, Kutcher announced Sound Ventures, the successor to A-Grade Investments managing a fund backed by institutional funding.[31] On October 29, 2013, Lenovo announced that it hired Kutcher as product engineer.[32] Kutcher was part of the management team for Ooma, a tech start-up launched in September 2007. Ooma is in the Voice over Internet Protocol business and Kutcher's role was as Creative Director. He spearheaded a marketing campaign and produced viral videos to promote this service. Kutcher also created an interactive arm of Katalyst called Katalyst Media, with his partner from Katalyst Films, Jason Goldberg. Their first site was the animated cartoon Blah Girls. Ooma revamped its sales and marketing strategy with a new management team in the summer of 2008, replacing Kutcher as their creative director. Rich Buchanan, from Sling Media, became Ooma's Chief Marketing Officer.[33] Kutcher has invested in an Italian restaurant, Dolce[10] (other owners include Danny Masterson and Wilmer Valderrama) and a Japanese-themed restaurant named Geisha House with locations in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City.[34] Geisha House went out of business on June 1, 2013.[35] In 2019 Ashton Kutcher, Mark Cuban, Steve Watts and Watts\u2019 wife Angela, invested a 50% stake in Veldskoen shoes fledgling US business. [36] In 2009, Kutcher established an international human rights organization with his then-wife Demi Moore. DNA Foundation, later known as Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children, works to address the sexual exploitation of children and the proliferation of child pornography on a global scale.[37] On March 23, 2011, Kutcher launched his own Twitter client with UberMedia called A.plus. While the app was initially available exclusively for desktop computers with Adobe Air installed, it eventually became available on mobile platforms, for iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry. In order to download on one of the 3 mobile platforms, users must first have the UberSocial client installed on their device and then proceed to the device's browser to download A.plus.[38][39] In 2013, Kutcher teamed up with Evan Beard and Kendall Dabaghi to launch A Plus, where Kutcher is currently Chairman of the Board.[40] Initially a product discovery service,[41] it morphed in April 2014 to a social media-driven content platform focused on upbeat stories.[42] It was officially launched in that incarnation in January 2015.[43] It has reported 27.5 million monthly uniques in the United States, has an Alexa rank of about 11787 (4019 in the US), and is ranked by Quantcast as a top 50 site in the US in terms of unique visitors.[40][44] Ashton Kutcher received widespread criticism for his appearance in a Popchips ad campaign in May 2012.[45] The campaign featured Kutcher as an Indian man \"looking for love\" in a dating ad-style spoof. Kutcher's use of brown face paint and a stereotypical Indian accent received backlash from online viewers and members of the Indian-American community.[46] The woman Kutcher dated in 2001, Ashley Ellerin, was brutally murdered; in 2019 Kutcher, never a suspect, testified at the trial for Michael Gargiulo that he had been at her home the night she was murdered. [47][48] Kutcher and actress Demi Moore married on September 24, 2005.[49] Six years later, on November 17, 2011, Moore announced her intention to end the marriage. After more than a year of separation, Kutcher filed for divorce from Moore on December 21, 2012, in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.[50] The divorce was finalized on November 27, 2013.[49] Kutcher began dating his former That '70s Show co-star Mila Kunis during the first half of 2012.[51] After they became engaged in February 2014,[52] she gave birth to their daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher in October 2014.[53][54] Kunis married Kutcher in July 2015.[55] She gave birth to their son Dimitri Portwood Kutcher in November 2016.[56] Kutcher describes himself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal.[57] He is a gun owner; however, he supports new gun laws to help stop mass shootings. Following the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, he said on his Twitter \"I've had a gun since I was 12 yrs old but enough is enough. I'm a hunter and a sportsman but nobody needs [Assault rifles]. Let's pray. Then let's change the law.\"[58] He trains in the martial art Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and is currently a brown belt under Rigan Machado.[59] On September 17, 2008, Kutcher was named the assistant coach for the freshman football team at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. However, he was unable to return in 2009 because he was filming Spread.[60][61] In February 2011, Kutcher sold his Hollywood Hills home, which he originally bought in 2004.[62] Kutcher, a Roman Catholic, has visited Israel and studied the Kabbalah.[63] His No Strings Attached co-star, Natalie Portman, stated in 2011 that Kutcher \"has taught me more about Judaism than I think I have ever learned from anyone else\".[64] On trips to Israel, Kutcher visited Kabbalah centers in Tel Aviv and in Tsfat.[63] In 2013, Kutcher remarked, \"Israel is near and dear to my heart ... coming to Israel is sort of coming back to the source of creation\u00a0\u2013 trying to get closer to that. And as a creative person, going to the source of creation is really inspiring. And this place has been really inspiring for me\u00a0\u2013 not only on a spiritual level, but also on an artistic and creative level.\"[65] In April 2012, Kutcher became the 500th paying customer to sign up to ride Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo.[66] On April 16, 2009, Kutcher became the first Twitter user to reach more than 1 million followers,[67] beating CNN in the site's \"Million followers contest\".[68][69] However, there have been several reports that Twitter manipulated the contest's results by preventing users from \"unfollowing\" Kutcher or CNN.[70] In November 2011, Kutcher received heavy criticism for his tweet in response to the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal, calling the firing of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno \"in poor taste\".[71] Kutcher subsequently turned over management of his Twitter account to his team at the Katalyst Media company.[72] On March 8, 2015, Kutcher sparked a national debate regarding the lack of equal access to diaper changing facilities in men's restrooms with this Facebook post: \"There are NEVER diaper changing stations in mens [sic] public restrooms. The first public men's room that I go into that has one gets a free shout out on my FB page!\"[73] Kutcher has leveraged his social media presence, particularly on Facebook, to post and promote content published by A Plus, a social media-driven content platform and associated company of which he is the chairman.[40] In April 2011, Kutcher and then-wife Demi Moore began a public service announcement campaign to end child sex trafficking.[74] Kutcher claimed that 100,000 to 300,000 American children were sold into sexual slavery. The number was criticized by newspaper The Village Voice. Kutcher and others including the New York Times, CSPAN, and CNN used a peer-reviewed study referring to minors at risk for sexual exploitation.[75] The Village Voice, from their research, said it was only hundreds of children.[76] Kutcher claimed the criticism by the Village Voice promoted child prostitution and used Twitter to request that Village Voice advertisers withdraw their advertising from publications owned by its parent company.[77][78] Since he started acting, Kutcher has been nominated by the Teen Choice Awards the most. He has also won awards for his romantic comedies A Lot like Love, What Happens in Vegas and No Strings Attached. In 1999, he was nominated by the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series by a Supporting Young Actor as Michael Kelso in That '70s Show.

He began his acting career portraying Michael Kelso in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show (1998\u20132006). He made his film debut in the romantic comedy Coming Soon (1999), followed by the comedy film Dude, Where's My Car? (2000), which was a box office hit. In 2003, Kutcher moved into romantic comedies, appearing in that year's Just Married and My Boss's Daughter. In 2003, he created and produced the television series Punk'd, also serving as host for the first eight of its ten seasons. In 2004, Kutcher starred in the lead role of the psychological film  The Butterfly Effect.\nKutcher subsequently appeared in more romantic comedies, including Guess Who (2005), A Lot Like Love (2005), What Happens in Vegas (2008), and No Strings Attached (2011). He starred as Walden Schmidt on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men (2011\u20132015). In 2013, Kutcher portrayed Steve Jobs in the biographical film Jobs. Since 2016, he has starred as Colt Bennett in the Netflix series The Ranch.\nBeyond entertainment, Kutcher is also a venture capitalist. He is a co-founder of the venture capital firm A-Grade Investments. At SXSW on March 14, 2015, Kutcher announced Sound Ventures, the successor to A-Grade Investments managing a fund backed by institutional funding. Kutcher has also successfully invested in several high technology startups. Kutcher has investments in over 60 companies, the most prominent of which include Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb, Path and Fab.com. Kutcher has invested in five startups as of August\u00a02017[update]\u2014Neighborly, Zenreach, ResearchGate, Kopari Beauty, and Lemonade\u2014marking his foray into the \"insurtech\" sector.\nKutcher was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Diane (n\u00e9e Finnegan), a Procter &amp; Gamble employee, and Larry M. Kutcher, a factory worker.[2][3] He has Czech, German, and Irish ancestry.[4][5]\nKutcher was raised in a \"relatively conservative\" Catholic family.[6] He has an older sister named Tausha and a fraternal twin brother named Michael, who had a heart transplant when the brothers were young children. [7] Michael also has cerebral palsy and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization Reaching for the Stars.[8] Michael's cardiomyopathy caused Kutcher's home life to become increasingly stressful. He has said he \"didn't want to come home and find more bad news\" about his brother, stating, \"I kept myself so busy that I didn't allow myself to feel.\"[9]\nKutcher attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids for his freshman year, before his family moved to Homestead, Iowa, where he attended Clear Creek Amana High School. During high school, he developed a passion for acting and appeared in school plays and his parents divorced when he was 16. During his senior year, he broke into his high school at midnight with his cousin in an attempt to steal money; he was arrested leaving the scene. Kutcher was convicted of third-degree burglary and sentenced to three years of probation and 180 hours of community service. Kutcher stated that although the experience \"straightened him out\", he lost his girlfriend and anticipated college scholarships, and was ostracized at school and in his community.[10]\nKutcher enrolled at the University of Iowa in August 1996, where his planned major was biochemical engineering, motivated by the desire to cure his brother's heart ailment.[3] At college, Kutcher was kicked out of his apartment for being too \"noisy\" and \"wild\".[11] Kutcher stated, \"I thought I knew everything but I didn't have a clue. I was partying, and I woke up many mornings not knowing what I had done the night before. I played way too hard. I am amazed I am not dead.\"[12] To earn tuition money, Kutcher worked as a college summer hire in the cereal department for the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids and sometimes sold his blood plasma.[13] While at the University of Iowa, he was approached by a model scout at The Airliner bar in Iowa City, Iowa,[14] and entered the \"Fresh Faces of Iowa\" modeling competition. Placing first, he won a trip to New York City's International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Convention. Leaving U of Iowa for a stay in New York City, Kutcher then returned to Cedar Rapids, before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.[11]\nAfter participating in an IMTA competition in 1998, Kutcher signed with Next modeling agency in New York, appeared in commercials for Calvin Klein, and modelled in Paris and Milan.[15]\nFollowing his success in modeling, Kutcher moved to Los Angeles after his first audition.[16] He was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series That '70s Show, from 1998 to 2006. Kutcher was cast in a series of film roles; although he auditioned but was not cast for the role of Danny Walker in Pearl Harbor (2001) (replaced by Josh Hartnett), he starred in several comedy films, including Dude, Where's My Car? (2000), Just Married (2003), and Guess Who (2005). He appeared in the 2003 family film Cheaper By The Dozen as a self-obsessed actor. In the 2004 drama film The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher played a conflicted young man who time travels. The film received mixed to negative reviews, but was a box office success.[10]\nIn 2003, Kutcher produced and starred as the host in his own series, MTV's Punk'd, that involved hidden camera tricks performed on celebrities. He is also an executive producer of the reality television shows Beauty and the Geek, Adventures in Hollyhood (based around the rap group Three 6 Mafia), The Real Wedding Crashers, and the game show Opportunity Knocks. Many of his production credits, including Punk'd, come through Katalyst Films, a production company he runs with partner Jason Goldberg.[17] A 2004 interviewer described Kutcher as a \"hunky young actor [who] is heading in all different directions at once\", including \"the hot L.A. restaurant Dolce\":\n\"If anything, I'm a trier,\" says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. \"I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out\u2014if That '70s Show got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career\u2014I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week. It allows a lot of time for sitting around, which I always kind of filled with work.[18]\nBecause of scheduling conflicts with the filming of The Guardian, Kutcher was unable to renew his contract for the eighth and final season of That '70s Show, although he appeared in its first four episodes (credited as a special guest star) and returned for the series finale.[10] Kutcher produced and starred in the 2010 action comedy, Killers, in which he played a hitman.[19] In May 2011, Kutcher was announced as Charlie Sheen's replacement on the series Two and a Half Men.[20]\nKutcher's contract was for one year and was believed to be worth nearly $20 million.[21] His debut as the character Walden Schmidt, entitled \"Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt\", was seen by 28.7 million people on September 19, 2011. The Nielsen ratings company reported that figure was more than any episode in the show's first eight seasons, when Sheen starred in it.[22][23] Kutcher earned $750,000 an episode on the show.[24] The show ended with a forty-minute series finale \"Of Course He's Dead\" on February 19, 2015.\nKutcher appeared as a guest Shark during the seventh season of reality TV show Shark Tank, which premiered on September 25, 2015.[25]\nIn 2016, he appeared in the \"Candy, Quahog Marshmallow\" episode of Family Guy.[26]\nSince 2016, he has starred in the Netflix series, The Ranch, alongside Danny Masterson, Elisha Cuthbert and Debra Winger, playing the role of Colt Bennett, the son of a Colorado rancher (Sam Elliott) returning home from a semi-pro football career to run the family business on the ranch.\nBeyond the entertainment world, Kutcher has invested in several high technology startups.[27][28] Kutcher has invested in five startups as of August\u00a02017[update]\u2014Neighborly, Zenreach, ResearchGate, Kopari Beauty, and most recently, Lemonade\u2014marking his foray into the \"insurtech\" sector.[29]\nHe is a co-founder of the venture capital firm A-Grade Investments with Guy Oseary and Ron Burkle and fund manager Chris Hollod. Kutcher, Oseary &amp; Burkle started by initially investing $30m of their own funds in 2010 when they founded the firm, by 2016 Forbes valued the firms holdings at $236m[30]. At SXSW on March 14, 2015, Kutcher announced Sound Ventures, the successor to A-Grade Investments managing a fund backed by institutional funding.[31]\nOn October 29, 2013, Lenovo announced that it hired Kutcher as product engineer.[32] Kutcher was part of the management team for Ooma, a tech start-up launched in September 2007. Ooma is in the Voice over Internet Protocol business and Kutcher's role was as Creative Director. He spearheaded a marketing campaign and produced viral videos to promote this service. Kutcher also created an interactive arm of Katalyst called Katalyst Media, with his partner from Katalyst Films, Jason Goldberg. Their first site was the animated cartoon Blah Girls. Ooma revamped its sales and marketing strategy with a new management team in the summer of 2008, replacing Kutcher as their creative director. Rich Buchanan, from Sling Media, became Ooma's Chief Marketing Officer.[33]\nKutcher has invested in an Italian restaurant, Dolce[10] (other owners include Danny Masterson and Wilmer Valderrama) and a Japanese-themed restaurant named Geisha House with locations in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City.[34] Geisha House went out of business on June 1, 2013.[35]\nIn 2019 Ashton Kutcher, Mark Cuban, Steve Watts and Watts\u2019 wife Angela, invested a 50% stake in Veldskoen shoes fledgling US business.\n[36]\nIn 2009, Kutcher established an international human rights organization with his then-wife Demi Moore. DNA Foundation, later known as Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children, works to address the sexual exploitation of children and the proliferation of child pornography on a global scale.[37] On March 23, 2011, Kutcher launched his own Twitter client with UberMedia called A.plus. While the app was initially available exclusively for desktop computers with Adobe Air installed, it eventually became available on mobile platforms, for iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry. In order to download on one of the 3 mobile platforms, users must first have the UberSocial client installed on their device and then proceed to the device's browser to download A.plus.[38][39]\nIn 2013, Kutcher teamed up with Evan Beard and Kendall Dabaghi to launch A Plus, where Kutcher is currently Chairman of the Board.[40] Initially a product discovery service,[41] it morphed in April 2014 to a social media-driven content platform focused on upbeat stories.[42] It was officially launched in that incarnation in January 2015.[43] It has reported 27.5 million monthly uniques in the United States, has an Alexa rank of about 11787 (4019 in the US), and is ranked by Quantcast as a top 50 site in the US in terms of unique visitors.[40][44]\nAshton Kutcher received widespread criticism for his appearance in a Popchips ad campaign in May 2012.[45] The campaign featured Kutcher as an Indian man \"looking for love\" in a dating ad-style spoof. Kutcher's use of brown face paint and a stereotypical Indian accent received backlash from online viewers and members of the Indian-American community.[46]\nThe woman Kutcher dated in 2001, Ashley Ellerin, was brutally murdered; in 2019 Kutcher, never a suspect, testified at the trial for Michael Gargiulo that he had been at her home the night she was murdered. [47][48]\nKutcher and actress Demi Moore married on September 24, 2005.[49] Six years later, on November 17, 2011, Moore announced her intention to end the marriage. After more than a year of separation, Kutcher filed for divorce from Moore on December 21, 2012, in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.[50] The divorce was finalized on November 27, 2013.[49]\nKutcher began dating his former That '70s Show co-star Mila Kunis during the first half of 2012.[51] After they became engaged in February 2014,[52] she gave birth to their daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher in October 2014.[53][54] Kunis married Kutcher in July 2015.[55] She gave birth to their son Dimitri Portwood Kutcher in November 2016.[56]\nKutcher describes himself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal.[57] He is a gun owner; however, he supports new gun laws to help stop mass shootings. Following the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, he said on his Twitter \"I've had a gun since I was 12 yrs old but enough is enough. I'm a hunter and a sportsman but nobody needs [Assault rifles]. Let's pray. Then let's change the law.\"[58]\nHe trains in the martial art Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and is currently a brown belt under Rigan Machado.[59]\nOn September 17, 2008, Kutcher was named the assistant coach for the freshman football team at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. However, he was unable to return in 2009 because he was filming Spread.[60][61]\nIn February 2011, Kutcher sold his Hollywood Hills home, which he originally bought in 2004.[62]\nKutcher, a Roman Catholic, has visited Israel and studied the Kabbalah.[63] His No Strings Attached co-star, Natalie Portman, stated in 2011 that Kutcher \"has taught me more about Judaism than I think I have ever learned from anyone else\".[64] On trips to Israel, Kutcher visited Kabbalah centers in Tel Aviv and in Tsfat.[63] In 2013, Kutcher remarked, \"Israel is near and dear to my heart ... coming to Israel is sort of coming back to the source of creation\u00a0\u2013 trying to get closer to that. And as a creative person, going to the source of creation is really inspiring. And this place has been really inspiring for me\u00a0\u2013 not only on a spiritual level, but also on an artistic and creative level.\"[65]\nIn April 2012, Kutcher became the 500th paying customer to sign up to ride Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo.[66]\nOn April 16, 2009, Kutcher became the first Twitter user to reach more than 1 million followers,[67] beating CNN in the site's \"Million followers contest\".[68][69] However, there have been several reports that Twitter manipulated the contest's results by preventing users from \"unfollowing\" Kutcher or CNN.[70]\nIn November 2011, Kutcher received heavy criticism for his tweet in response to the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal, calling the firing of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno \"in poor taste\".[71] Kutcher subsequently turned over management of his Twitter account to his team at the Katalyst Media company.[72]\nOn March 8, 2015, Kutcher sparked a national debate regarding the lack of equal access to diaper changing facilities in men's restrooms with this Facebook post: \"There are NEVER diaper changing stations in mens [sic] public restrooms. The first public men's room that I go into that has one gets a free shout out on my FB page!\"[73]\nKutcher has leveraged his social media presence, particularly on Facebook, to post and promote content published by A Plus, a social media-driven content platform and associated company of which he is the chairman.[40]\nIn April 2011, Kutcher and then-wife Demi Moore began a public service announcement campaign to end child sex trafficking.[74] Kutcher claimed that 100,000 to 300,000 American children were sold into sexual slavery. The number was criticized by newspaper The Village Voice. Kutcher and others including the New York Times, CSPAN, and CNN used a peer-reviewed study referring to minors at risk for sexual exploitation.[75] The Village Voice, from their research, said it was only hundreds of children.[76] Kutcher claimed the criticism by the Village Voice promoted child prostitution and used Twitter to request that Village Voice advertisers withdraw their advertising from publications owned by its parent company.[77][78]\nSince he started acting, Kutcher has been nominated by the Teen Choice Awards the most. He has also won awards for his romantic comedies A Lot like Love, What Happens in Vegas and No Strings Attached. In 1999, he was nominated by the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series by a Supporting Young Actor as Michael Kelso in That '70s Show. He has also been nominated by the Kid's Choice Awards, MTV Movie Awards, People's Choice Awards, and the Golden Raspberry Awards.[80]\n</body></html>"

In 2007, she and her family began starring in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Its success led to the creation of spin-offs including Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami [2] and Kourtney and Kim Take New York.[3] With sisters Kim and Khlo\u00e9, Kourtney is involved in the retail and fashion industries. They have launched several clothing collections and fragrances, and additionally released the book Kardashian Konfidential in 2010. Kourtney launched her own website called 'Poosh' in early 2019. Kourtney and her siblings are popular on social media and endorse products such as waist slimming pants, beauty products, Coca-Cola and prescription drugs, for which they are paid (as of 2016) between $75,000 and $300,000 per post on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, as per CBC Marketplace.[4][5][6] Kourtney Mary Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California on April 18, 1979 to Robert and Kris.[7] She has two younger sisters, Kim and Khlo\u00e9, and a younger brother, Robert (Rob).[8] In 1991, her parents got divorced and her mother married Bruce Jenner, a 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner (Jenner later changed her name to Caitlyn[a]) in 1991.[10] Through their marriage, Kardashian gained stepbrothers Burton \"Burt\", Brandon, and Brody; stepsister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie.[11] She attended Marymount High School, a Roman Catholic all-girls school in Los Angeles. Following graduation, she moved to Dallas, Texas, to attend Southern Methodist University for two years. Kourtney then lived in Tucson, Arizona, where she graduated from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in Theatre Arts and a minor in Spanish. Her classmates included Nicole Richie and Luke Walton.[12] In 1994, her father garnered public attention as an additional defense lawyer for football player O.J. Simpson during his murder trial. Kourtney first became known to reality-television audiences on the 2005 series, Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, on which she earned money for charity. In February 2007, a sex tape made by her sister Kim and former boyfriend Ray J in 2003, Kim Kardashian, Superstar, was leaked, which largely contributed to her rise to prominence.[13][14] Later that year, Kourtney, in addition to her mother Kris; her stepfather Bruce (now known as Caitlyn);[15] her siblings Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie were commissioned to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[16] The series proved successful for E!, the network on which it is broadcast, and lead to several spin-offs, including Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami, Khlo\u00e9 & Lamar, and Kourtney and Kim Take New York .[17] Kourtney and her mother opened children's clothing boutiques called Smooch in the Los Angeles area and New York City; the boutiques carry the brand Crib Rock Couture. With sisters Kim and Khloe, Kardashian co-owns and operates D-A-S-H, a clothing boutique in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and a pop-up store in the Hamptons.[12] In the spring of 2010, Kourtney and her sisters released a clothing line for Bebe.[18][19][20] In August 2010, Kourtney announced that she and her sisters were working on another clothing line called K-Dash, sold on QVC.[21] Kardashian and her sisters created a sunless tanner called Kardashian Glamour Tan in 2010.[22] Kardashian wrote the book Kardashian Konfidential with her sisters Khloe and Kim; it was released in November 2010.[23] Kourtney made her acting debut with a guest appearance on the ABC soap One Life to Live on March 28, 2011, appearing as attorney Kassandra Kavanaugh.[24] Kardashian, who had grown up watching the soap opera and described her appearance as the realization of a \"lifelong dream,\" had reservations about her acting debut, stating: \"I'd thought I'd only have two lines. But my script is so long... I'm not an actress.\"[25][26] Her performance was met with negative reviews from critics.[27] In September 2012, she and younger sister Kim created another spinoff reality television series, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, which began airing in January 2013. It features their mother Kris Jenner and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.[28] Kourtney, Khlo\u00e9, and Kim were spokeswomen for the diet supplement Quick Trim, for weight loss. In March 2012 the three sisters were named in a $5 million class-action lawsuit against QuickTrim.[29] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accused the Kardashians, along with QuickTrim's manufacturer Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain, of false and deceptive marketing. The plaintiffs, from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[30] Kardashian also represents the skincare line PerfectSkin with her sisters, which was developed by Dr. Ron DiSalvo for Perfect Science Labs.[31] The three sisters also released a 20-piece collection of jewelry line for the company Virgins, Saints, and Angels, in March 2010. The jewelry is reflective of their partial Armenian background.[32] In 2017, Kourtney launched her first solo fashion line as part of a collaboration with the site PrettyLittleThing. According to the website, the 32-piece line was inspired by Studio 54, classical Hollywood cinema, and the 1970s.[33] On March 5, 2019, Kardashian released her new lifestyle website named Poosh.[34] Kardashian dated Scott Disick from 2006 to 2015.[35] The two met at mutual friend Joe Francis's house party in Mexico.[36] Kardashian has three children with Disick: son Mason Dash (born December 14, 2009), daughter Penelope Scotland (born July 8, 2012),[37][38] and son Reign Aston (born December 14, 2014).[39] Kardashian and Disick's on-again, off-again relationship has been shown on Keeping Up With the Kardashians and its numerous spin offs. Kardashian's pregnancies and the births of all three of her children have also been featured on the show.[40][41] In early 2010, the couple temporarily moved to Miami with their son and Kourtney's sister Kim. During this time, Kourtney believed Disick had an alcohol problem. After regularly attending therapy and temporarily giving up alcohol, Disick and Kourtney reconciled and they continued their relationship in mid-2010.[42] In 2011, during the final episode in the first season of Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Disick purchased an engagement ring and planned to propose to Kourtney during an evening meal in New York City. However, when Disick asked Kourtney's opinion on marriage, she responded with, \"If things are so good now...why would we want to change that?\", so he did not propose.[43] In October 2019 Kardashian and her children were baptized in an Armenian Apostolic ceremony at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat, Armenia. During the ceremony, she was christened with the Armenian name Gayane.[44]",

In 2007, she and her family began starring in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Its success led to the creation of spin-offs including Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami [2] and Kourtney and Kim Take New York.[3]\nWith sisters Kim and Khlo\u00e9, Kourtney is involved in the retail and fashion industries. They have launched several clothing collections and fragrances, and additionally released the book Kardashian Konfidential in 2010. Kourtney launched her own website called 'Poosh' in early 2019.\nKourtney and her siblings are popular on social media and endorse products such as waist slimming pants, beauty products, Coca-Cola and prescription drugs, for which they are paid (as of 2016) between $75,000 and $300,000 per post on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, as per CBC Marketplace.[4][5][6]\nKourtney Mary Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California on April 18, 1979 to Robert and Kris.[7] She has two younger sisters, Kim and Khlo\u00e9, and a younger brother, Robert (Rob).[8] In 1991, her parents got divorced and her mother married Bruce Jenner, a 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner (Jenner later changed her name to Caitlyn[a]) in 1991.[10] Through their marriage, Kardashian gained stepbrothers Burton \"Burt\", Brandon, and Brody; stepsister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie.[11]\nShe attended Marymount High School, a Roman Catholic all-girls school in Los Angeles. Following graduation, she moved to Dallas, Texas, to attend Southern Methodist University for two years. Kourtney then lived in Tucson, Arizona, where she graduated from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in Theatre Arts and a minor in Spanish. Her classmates included Nicole Richie and Luke Walton.[12] In 1994, her father garnered public attention as an additional defense lawyer for football player O.J. Simpson during his murder trial.\nKourtney first became known to reality-television audiences on the 2005 series, Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, on which she earned money for charity. In February 2007, a sex tape made by her sister Kim and former boyfriend Ray J in 2003, Kim Kardashian, Superstar, was leaked, which largely contributed to her rise to prominence.[13][14] Later that year, Kourtney, in addition to her mother Kris; her stepfather Bruce (now known as Caitlyn);[15] her siblings Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie were commissioned to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[16] The series proved successful for E!, the network on which it is broadcast, and lead to several spin-offs, including Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami, Khlo\u00e9 &amp; Lamar, and Kourtney and Kim Take New York .[17]\nKourtney and her mother opened children's clothing boutiques called Smooch in the Los Angeles area and New York City; the boutiques carry the brand Crib Rock Couture.  With sisters Kim and Khloe, Kardashian co-owns and operates D-A-S-H, a clothing boutique in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and a pop-up store in the Hamptons.[12]\nIn the spring of 2010, Kourtney and her sisters released a clothing line for Bebe.[18][19][20] In August 2010, Kourtney announced that she and her sisters were working on another clothing line called K-Dash, sold on QVC.[21] Kardashian and her sisters created a sunless tanner called Kardashian Glamour Tan in 2010.[22] Kardashian wrote the book Kardashian Konfidential with her sisters Khloe and Kim; it was released in November 2010.[23]\nKourtney made her acting debut with a guest appearance on the ABC soap One Life to Live on March 28, 2011, appearing as attorney Kassandra Kavanaugh.[24] Kardashian, who had grown up watching the soap opera and described her appearance as the realization of a \"lifelong dream,\" had reservations about her acting debut, stating: \"I'd thought I'd only have two lines. But my script is so long... I'm not an actress.\"[25][26] Her performance was met with negative reviews from critics.[27] In September 2012, she and younger sister Kim created another spinoff reality television series, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, which began airing in January 2013. It features their mother Kris Jenner and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.[28]\nKourtney, Khlo\u00e9, and Kim were spokeswomen for the diet supplement Quick Trim, for weight loss. In March 2012 the three sisters were named in a $5 million class-action lawsuit against QuickTrim.[29] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accused the Kardashians, along with QuickTrim's manufacturer Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain, of false and deceptive marketing. The plaintiffs, from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[30]\nKardashian also represents the skincare line PerfectSkin with her sisters, which was developed by Dr. Ron DiSalvo for Perfect Science Labs.[31] The three sisters also released a 20-piece collection of jewelry line for the company Virgins, Saints, and Angels, in March 2010. The jewelry is reflective of their partial Armenian background.[32] In 2017, Kourtney launched her first solo fashion line as part of a collaboration with the site PrettyLittleThing. According to the website, the 32-piece line was inspired by Studio 54, classical Hollywood cinema, and the 1970s.[33]\nOn March 5, 2019, Kardashian released her new lifestyle website named Poosh.[34]\nKardashian dated Scott Disick from 2006 to 2015.[35] The two met at mutual friend Joe Francis's house party in Mexico.[36] Kardashian has three children with Disick: son Mason Dash (born December 14, 2009), daughter Penelope Scotland (born July 8, 2012),[37][38] and son Reign Aston (born December 14, 2014).[39]\nKardashian and Disick's on-again, off-again relationship has been shown on Keeping Up With the Kardashians and its numerous spin offs. Kardashian's pregnancies and the births of all three of her children have also been featured on the show.[40][41]\nIn early 2010, the couple temporarily moved to Miami with their son and Kourtney's sister Kim. During this time, Kourtney believed Disick had an alcohol problem. After regularly attending therapy and temporarily giving up alcohol, Disick and Kourtney reconciled and they continued their relationship in mid-2010.[42]\nIn 2011, during the final episode in the first season of Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Disick purchased an engagement ring and planned to propose to Kourtney during an evening meal in New York City. However, when Disick asked Kourtney's opinion on marriage, she responded with, \"If things are so good now...why would we want to change that?\", so he did not propose.[43]\nIn October 2019 Kardashian and her children were baptized in an Armenian Apostolic ceremony at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat, Armenia. During the ceremony, she was christened with the Armenian name Gayane.[44]\n</body></html>"

The district includes the eastern part of the Bronx and portions of north-central Queens in New York City. She is a member of the Democratic Party. Ocasio-Cortez drew national recognition when she won the Democratic Party's primary election for New York's 14th congressional district on June 26, 2018. She defeated Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, in what was widely seen as the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterm election primaries.[2][3][4] She defeated Republican opponent Anthony Pappas in the November 6, 2018, general election. At age 29, Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman to serve in the United States Congress.[5] Ocasio-Cortez has been noted for her substantial social media presence relative to her fellow members of Congress.[6] Ocasio-Cortez is among the first female members of the Democratic Socialists of America elected to serve in Congress.[7][8] Ocasio-Cortez advocates a progressive platform that includes Medicare for all, a federal jobs guarantee, a proposed Green New Deal, abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, free public college and trade school, and a 70% marginal tax rate for incomes above $10\u00a0million. Ocasio-Cortez majored in international relations and economics at Boston University, graduating cum laude in 2011. She then worked as a waitress and bartender before running for Congress in 2018; she also served as an educational director for the five-day-long 2017 Northeast Collegiate World Series for the National Hispanic Institute.[9][10] Ocasio-Cortez was born into a Catholic family in the Bronx borough of New York City on October 13, 1989, the daughter of Blanca Ocasio-Cortez (n\u00e9e Cortez) and Sergio Ocasio.[11] She has a younger brother named Gabriel.[12] Her father was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican family and became an architect; her mother was born in Puerto Rico.[13][14] She has described her Puerto Rican community as an amalgamation, stating, \"We are black; we are indigenous; we are Spanish; we are European.\"[15] Ocasio-Cortez lived with her family in an apartment in the Bronx neighborhood of Parkchester.[14] When she was five, the family moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights.[14][16] Ocasio-Cortez attended Yorktown High School, graduating in 2007.[17] In high school and college, Ocasio-Cortez went by the name of \"Sandy\".[18] She came in second in the Microbiology category of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair with a microbiology research project on the effect of antioxidants on the lifespan of the nematode C. elegans.[19] In a show of appreciation for her efforts, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a small asteroid after her: 23238 Ocasio-Cortez.[20][21] In high school, she took part in the National Hispanic Institute's Lorenzo de Zavala (LDZ) Youth Legislative Session. She later became the LDZ Secretary of State while she attended Boston University. Ocasio-Cortez had a John F. Lopez Fellowship.[9] In 2008, while Ocasio-Cortez was a sophomore at Boston University, her father died of lung cancer.[22][23] Ocasio-Cortez became involved in a lengthy probate battle to settle his estate. She has said that the experience helped her learn \"firsthand how attorneys appointed by the court to administer an estate can enrich themselves at the expense of the families struggling to make sense of the bureaucracy\".[24] During college, Ocasio-Cortez served as an intern for U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, in his section on foreign affairs and immigration issues.[25] She recalled, \"I was the only Spanish speaker, and as a result, as basically a kid\u2014a 19-, 20-year-old kid\u2014whenever a frantic call would come into the office because someone is looking for their husband because they have been snatched off the street by ICE, I was the one that had to pick up that phone. I was the one that had to help that person navigate that system.\"[25] Ocasio-Cortez graduated cum laude from Boston University College of Arts and Sciences with a BA in 2011, majoring in international relations and economics.[9][26][27] After college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx and took a job as a bartender and waitress to help her mother\u2014a house cleaner and school bus driver\u2014fight foreclosure of their home.[28][10] She later launched Brook Avenue Press, a now-defunct publishing firm for books that portrayed the Bronx in a positive light.[29][30] Ocasio-Cortez also worked for the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute.[9][31][32] During the 2016 primary, Ocasio-Cortez worked as an organizer for Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign.[33] After the general election, she traveled across America by car, visiting places such as Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, and speaking to people affected by the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline.[34] In an interview she recalled her December 2016 visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point, saying that before that, she had believed that the only way to run for office effectively was to have access to wealth, social influence, and power. But her visit to North Dakota, where she saw others \"putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community\", inspired her to begin to work for her own community.[35] One day after she visited North Dakota, she got a phone call from Brand New Congress, which was recruiting progressive candidates (her brother had nominated her soon after Election Day 2016).[36] Ocasio-Cortez began her campaign while waiting tables and tending bar at Flats Fix, a taqueria in New York City's Union Square.[37] \"For 80 percent of this campaign, I operated out of a paper grocery bag hidden behind that bar,\" she told Bon App\u00e9tit.[38] She was the first person since 2004 to challenge Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, in the primary. She faced a financial disadvantage, saying, \"You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game.\"[39][40][24] Her campaign posters' design were said to have taken inspiration from \"revolutionary posters and visuals from the past\".[41] On June 15, the candidates' only face-to-face encounter during the campaign occurred on a local political talk show, Inside City Hall. The format was a joint interview conducted by Errol Louis, which NY1 characterized as a debate.[42] On June 18, a debate in the Bronx was scheduled, but Crowley did not participate. He sent former New York City Council member Annabel Palma in his place.[43][44][45] Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by progressive and civil rights organizations such as MoveOn,[46] Black Lives Matter,[47] and Democracy for America,[33] and by actress and first-time candidate Cynthia Nixon.[48] Nixon, like Ocasio-Cortez, also challenged a longtime incumbent: she ran against Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 New York gubernatorial election[49] but lost by 66% to 34%.[50] Governor Cuomo endorsed Crowley, as did both of New York's U.S. Senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, 11 U.S. Representatives, 31 local elected officials, 31 trade unions, and progressive groups such as the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood, the Working Families Party, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, among others.[51][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] California representative Ro Khanna, a Justice Democrat like Ocasio-Cortez,[52] initially endorsed Crowley but later endorsed Ocasio-Cortez in an unusual dual endorsement.[53] On June 26, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez received 57.13% of the vote (15,897) to Joe Crowley's 42.5% (11,761), defeating the 10-term incumbent by almost 15 percentage points.[54] Her win, and Crowley's defeat, came as a shock to many political commentators and analysts and immediately garnered nationwide attention. Time called her victory \"the biggest upset of the 2018 elections so far\";[55] CNN made a similar statement.[3] The New York Times described Crowley's loss as \"a shocking primary defeat on Tuesday, the most significant loss for a Democratic incumbent in more than a decade, and one that will reverberate across the party and the country\".[33] The Guardian called it \"one of the biggest upsets in recent American political history\".[56] She was outspent by a margin of 18 to 1 ($1.5 million to $83,000) but won the endorsement of some influential groups on the party's far left.[57] Merriam-Webster reported that searches for the word \"socialism\" spiked 1,500% after her victory.[58] Crowley conceded defeat on election night,[59] but did not telephone Ocasio-Cortez that night to congratulate her, fueling short-lived speculation that he intended to run against her in the general election.[60] Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky congratulated her.[61][62] Several commentators noted the similarities between Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Crowley and Dave Brat's Tea Party movement-supported 2014 victory over Eric Cantor in the Republican primary for Virginia's 7th congressional district.[63][64] Like Crowley, Cantor was a high-ranking member in his party's caucus.[65] After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed several progressive primary challengers to Democratic incumbents nationwide,[66] capitalizing on her fame and spending her political capital in a manner unusual even for unexpected primary winners.[67] Without campaigning for it, Ocasio-Cortez won the Reform Party primary as a write-in candidate in a neighboring congressional district, New York's 15th, with a total vote count of nine, highest among all 22 write-in candidates. She declined the nomination.[68][69] Ocasio-Cortez faced Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election.[70] Pappas, who lives in Astoria, is an economics professor at St. John's University. According to the New York Post, Pappas did not actively campaign. The Post wrote that \"Pappas' bid was a long shot,\" since the 14th has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29, making it the sixth most Democratic district in New York City. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost six to one.[71][72][73] The district and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands for all but two years since 1923 and without interruption since 1949. Ocasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former President Barack Obama and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.[74][75] She spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in August 2018, and was called \"the undisputed star of the convention\".[76] Crowley also remained on the ballot, as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women's Equality Party (WEP). Neither Crowley nor the WFP party actively campaigned, with both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after her Democratic primary victory.[77] Ocasio-Cortez described the WEP, which Governor Cuomo created ahead of the 2014 New York gubernatorial election, as a cynical, centrist group that endorsed male incumbents over female challengers like her and Nixon.[78] Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who won reelection in 2006 on a third-party line after losing the Democratic Primary in 2006, penned a July 17 column in the Wall Street Journal expressing his hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line.[79] Dan Cantor, Executive Director of the WFP, wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the New York Daily News; he asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.[80] Ocasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (110,318) to Pappas' 14% (17,762). Crowley, on the WFP and WEP lines, received 9,348 votes (6.6%). Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up 41 seats.[81] Saikat Chakrabarti, who had been her campaign co-chair, became chief of staff for her congressional office.[82] Co-creator of two progressive political action committees, he has been called a significant political presence.[83] After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez quickly garnered nationwide media attention, including numerous articles and TV talk-show appearances. She also drew a great deal of media attention when she and Sanders campaigned for James Thompson in Kansas in July 2018. A rally in Wichita had to be moved from a theater with a capacity of 1,500 when far more people said they would attend. The event drew 4,000 people, with some seated on the floor. In The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote that while Sanders remained \"the de-facto leader of an increasingly popular left, [he is unable to] do things that do not come naturally to him, like supply hope\". Wallace-Wells suggested that Ocasio-Cortez had made Sanders's task easier, as he could point to her success to show that ideas \"once considered to be radical are now part of the mainstream\".[84] Until she defeated incumbent Joe Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary, Ocasio-Cortez received little coverage on most traditional news media outlets.[85][86] Jimmy Dore interviewed her when she first announced her candidacy in June 2017.[87] After her primary win, Brian Stelter wrote that progressive-media outlets, such as The Young Turks and The Intercept, \"saw the Ocasio-Cortez upset coming\" in advance.[64] Margaret Sullivan wrote in The Washington Post that traditional metrics of measuring a campaign's viability, like total fundraising, were contributing to a \"media failure\".[86] Ocasio-Cortez's campaign was featured on the cover of the June 2018 edition of The Indypendent,[88][89] a free New York City-based monthly newspaper. In a tweet she hailed the cover appearance on \"NYC's classic monthly\" as an important breakthrough for her campaign.[90] Otherwise Ocasio-Cortez was barely mentioned in print until her primary win.[91] Ocasio-Cortez was one of the subjects of the 2018 Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 11/9; it chronicled her primary campaign.[92][93] In an attempt to embarrass Ocasio-Cortez just before she took office, Twitter user \"AnonymousQ\" shared a video dating to Ocasio-Cortez's college years: a Boston University student-produced dance video in which she briefly appeared.[94] Many social media users came to her defense, inspiring memes and a Twitter account syncing the footage to songs like \"Mambo No. 5\" and \"Gangnam Style\".[95] Ocasio-Cortez responded by posting a \"lighthearted\" video of herself dancing to Edwin Starr's \"War\".[94] In 2019, Elizabeth Warren wrote the entry on Ocasio-Cortez for that year's Time 100.[96] In January 2019 the documentary Knock Down the House, which focuses on four female Democrats in the 2018 United States elections who were not career politicians, including Ocasio-Cortez, Amy Vilela, Cori Bush, and Paula Jean Swearengin, premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Ocasio-Cortez was the only one of the women featured to win.[97][98] It was released by Netflix on May 1, 2019.[99] When the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez entered with no seniority but with a large social media presence. Axios has credited her with \"as much social media clout as her fellow freshman Democrats combined\".[6] As of April\u00a02019[update], she had 3.8\u00a0million Twitter followers,[100] up from 1.4\u00a0million in November 2018[6] and surpassing Nancy Pelosi.[101] By July 2019 that had risen to almost 4.8 million,[102] or about seven times the population of her congressional district. She had 2.2\u00a0million Instagram followers as of January 2019[103] and 500,000 followers on Facebook as of February 2019.[104] Her colleagues appointed her to teach them social media lessons upon her arrival in Congress.[104] In early July 2019 two lawsuits were filed against her for blocking Joseph Saladino and Dov Hikind on Twitter in light of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that it was a violation of the First Amendment for President Trump to block people on Twitter.[105][106] On November 4, 2019, it was announced that they settled the lawsuit with Ocasio-Cortez issuing a statement apologizing for the Twitter block.[107][108] In an interview with the Yahoo! News podcast Skullduggery, Ocasio-Cortez said she had stopped using her private Facebook account and was minimizing her usage of all social media accounts and platforms, calling them a \"public health risk\".[109][110] In November 2018, on the first day of congressional orientation, Ocasio-Cortez participated in a climate change protest outside the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[111] Also that month, she backed Pelosi's bid to be Speaker of the House once the Democratic Party reclaimed the majority on the condition that Pelosi \"remains the most progressive candidate for speaker\".[112] During the orientation for new members hosted by the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter in December 2018 about the influence of corporate interests by sponsors such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies: \"Lobbyists are here. Goldman Sachs is here. Where's labor? Activists? Frontline community leaders?\"[113][114][115] In January 2019, when Ocasio-Cortez made her first speech on the floor of Congress, C-SPAN tweeted the video. Within 12 hours, the video of her four-minute speech set the record as C-SPAN's most-watched Twitter video by a member of the House of Representatives.[116] In February 2019, speaking at a Congressional hearing with a panel of representatives from campaign finance watchdog groups, Ocasio-Cortez questioned the panel about ethics regulations as they apply to both the president and members of Congress. She asserted that no regulations prevent lawmakers \"from being bought off by wealthy corporations\".[117] With more than 37.5\u00a0million views, the clip became the most-watched political video posted on Twitter.[118] When President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen appeared before the Oversight Committee in February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez asked him whether Trump had inflated property values for bank or insurance purposes and inquired where to get more information on the subject.[119] Cohen's reply implied that Trump may have committed potential tax and bank fraud in his personal and business tax returns, financial statements and real-estate filings.[120][121] New York Times columnist David Brooks praised her for \"laying down specific questions for specific predicates\".[122] According to reports in March 2019, Ocasio-Cortez continued to receive media coverage early in her congressional tenure on a par with that of 2020 presidential candidates[123] and was considered \"one of the faces of the Democratic party\"[124] and one of the most talked-about politicians in the United States.[125] Between July 8 and July 14, 2019, she drew more social media attention than the Democratic presidential candidates. Tracking company NewsWhip found that interactions with news articles on Ocasio-Cortez numbered 4.8 million, while no Democratic presidential candidate got more than 1.2 million. David Bauder of the Associated Press wrote that Trump's supporters are thus having \"some success\" in having \"Ocasio-Cortez be top of mind when people think of\" the Democratic Party.[126] According to a Media Matters for America study, Ocasio-Cortez has been intensely discussed on sister television channels Fox News and Fox Business, being mentioned every day from February 25 to April 7, 2019, for a total of 3,181 mentions in 42 days (an average of around 75 per day). The Guardian's David Smith wrote that this is evidence that Fox is \"obsessed by Ocasio-Cortez, portraying her as a radical socialist who threatens the American way of life.\"[127] Brian Stelter of CNN Business found that between January to July 2019, she had nearly three times as many mentions on Fox News as on CNN and MSNBC, and seven times the coverage of James Clyburn, a Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. Stelter wrote that the attention Ocasio-Cortez is receiving has caused \"the perception, particularly on the right, that her positions and policies are representative of the Democratic Party as a whole\".[128] In a CBS News and YouGov poll of almost 2,100 American adults conducted from July 17 to 19, it was found that Republican respondents were more aware of Ocasio-Cortez than Democratic respondents. She had very unfavorable ratings among Republican respondents and favorable ratings among Democratic respondents.[129] Ocasio-Cortez is a member of an informal group of progressive freshmen members of Congress called \"The Squad,\" along with Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).[130] On July 14, Trump attacked the Squad in a tweet, saying that they should \"go back and help fix\" the countries they came from rather than criticize the American government.[131] He continued to make the same kind of comment over the next several days, even though three of the women, including Ocasio-Cortez, were born in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet that \"the President's words [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color \"go back to your own country,\" is hallmark language of white supremacists.\" She later added, \"We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we propose the solutions to fix it.\"[132] Days later, Trump falsely asserted that Ocasio-Cortez called \"our country and our people 'garbage'\"; she had actually said that Americans should not be content with moderate policies that are \"10% better from garbage\".[133] Trump also falsely claimed that Ocasio-Cortez said \"illegal immigrants are more American\" than Americans who tried to keep them out; she actually said that \"women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and opportunity\" in America \"are acting more American\" than those who tried to keep them out.[134] In March 2019, PolitiFact reported that Ocasio-Cortez is \"one of the most targeted politicians for hoax claims, despite the fact that she just entered Congress as a freshman\". Fake quotes attributed to her, fake photos of her, and false rumors about her have spread on social media. Some of these have originated from 4chan and r/The_Donald.[135] By July 2019 the fake material included attributing things Trump said to Ocasio-Cortez, such as \"I have a very good brain and I\u2019ve said lots of things.\"[136] On July 18, 2019, Charlie Rispoli, a police officer from Gretna, posted on Facebook an apparent threat to shoot Ocasio-Cortez, calling her a \"vile idiot\" who \"needs a round, and I don't mean the kind she used to serve\" as a bartender. Rispoli posted the comment in response to a fake news article that falsely quoted Ocasio-Cortez as saying \"We pay soldiers too much\". A photo from the article also had the label \"satire\".[137] Rispoli was fired for his post and his Facebook account was deleted.[138] On February 7, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez submitted her first piece of legislation, the Green New Deal, to the Senate. She and Senator Ed Markey released a joint non-binding resolution laying out the main elements of a 10-year \"economic mobilization\" that would phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation's infrastructure. Their plan called for implementing the \"social cost of carbon\" that was part of the Obama administration's plans to address climate change. In the process it aimed to create jobs and boost the economy.[139] According to CNBC, an initial outline the Green New Deal called for \"completely ditching fossil fuels, upgrading or replacing 'every building' in the country and 'totally overhaul[ing] transportation' to the point where 'air travel stops becoming necessary'\". The outline set a goal of having the U.S. \"creating 'net-zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years. Why 'net zero'? The lawmakers explained: 'We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.'\"[140] Activist groups such as Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement came out in favor of the plan. No Republican lawmakers voiced support.[141][142] The plan gained support from some Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker;[143] other Democrats, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the proposal (Pelosi has referred to it as \"the green dream, or whatever they call it\").[144] On March 26, in what Democrats called a \"stunt\", Senate Republicans called for an early vote on the Green New Deal without allowing discussion or expert testimony. Markey said Republicans were trying to \"make a mockery\" of the Green New Deal debate and called the vote a \"sham\". In protest, Senate Democrats voted \"present\" or against the bill, resulting in a 57\u20130 defeat on the Senate floor.[145][146] In March 2019, a group of UK activists proposed that the Labour Party adopt a similar plan, \"Labour for a Green New Deal.\" The group said it was inspired by the Sunrise Movement and the work Ocasio-Cortez has done in the US.[147] Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America[7] and embraces the democratic socialist label as part of her political identity. In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, she described democratic socialism as \"part of what I am. It's not all of what I am. And I think that that's a very important distinction.\"[150] In response to a question about democratic socialism ultimately calling for an end to capitalism during a Firing Line interview on PBS, she answered: \"Ultimately, we are marching towards progress on this issue. I do think that we are going to see an evolution in our economic system of an unprecedented degree, and it's hard to say what direction that that takes.\"[151] Ocasio-Cortez supports progressive policies such as single-payer Medicare for All, tuition-free public college and trade school,[152] a federal job guarantee,[153] the cancellation of all $1.6 trillion of outstanding student debt,[154] guaranteed family leave,[155] abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,[156] ending the privatization of prisons, enacting gun-control policies,[157] and energy policy relying on 100% renewables.[158]She is open to using Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) as an economic pathway that could provide funding and enable implementation of these goals.[159] Ocasio-Cortez rejects the state socialist politics and economics of Cuba, the Soviet Union and Venezuela, and favors policies that \"most closely resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden.\"[160][161] Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential election and has been appearing with him at speaking engagements. Campaign rallies she has attended with him have drawn the largest crowds of any presidential rally. On January 25, she joined Michael Moore to fill in for Sanders at a rally at the University of Iowa while Sanders was attending the Senate's Trump impeachment trial.[162][163] Ocasio-Cortez has called for \"more environmental hardliners in Congress,\"[164] describing climate change as \"the single biggest national security threat for the United States and the single biggest threat to worldwide industrialized civilization.\"[165] Referring to a recent United Nations report indicating that the effects of climate change will be irreversible unless carbon emissions are reined in over the next 12 years, she said, \"Millennials and people\u2014you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and we\u2019re like: \u2018The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don\u2019t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'\"[166][167][168] Ocasio-Cortez's environmental plan, termed the Green New Deal, advocates for the United States to transition to an electrical grid running on 100% renewable energy[143] and to end the use of fossil fuels within 10 years. The changes, estimated to cost roughly $2.5 trillion per year, would be financed in part by higher taxes on the wealthy.[169][170][171] Ocasio-Cortez proposed introducing a marginal tax as high as 70% on income above $10\u00a0million to pay for the Green New Deal. According to tax experts contacted by The Washington Post, this tax would bring in extra revenue of $720\u00a0billion per decade.[172][173] Ocasio-Cortez has opposed and voted against the pay-as-you-go rule supported by Democratic leaders, which requires deficit-neutral fiscal policy, with all new expenditures balanced by tax increases or spending cuts. She and Representative Ro Khanna have condemned the rule as hamstringing new or expanded progressive policies.[174][175] She cites Modern Monetary Theory as a justification for higher deficits to finance her agenda.[159][176] Drawing a parallel with the Great Depression, she has argued that the Green New Deal needs deficit spending like the original New Deal.[164] Ocasio-Cortez has expressed support for defunding and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency on multiple occasions. In February 2018 she called it \"a product of the Bush-era Patriot Act suite of legislation\" and \"an enforcement agency that takes on more of a paramilitary tone every single day\".[177][178] That June she said she would \"stop short of fully disbanding the agency,\" and would rather \"create a pathway to citizenship for more immigrants through decriminalization.\"[179] She later clarified that this does not mean ceasing all deportations.[180] She has called the Department of Homeland Security's immigration detention centers \"black sites\", citing limited public access to them.[181] Two days before the primary election, Ocasio-Cortez attended a protest at an ICE child-detention center in Tornillo, Texas.[182] She was the only Democrat to vote against H.R. 648, a bill to fund and reopen the government, because it funded ICE.[183] In June 2019, Ocasio-Cortez compared the detention centers for undocumented immigrants at the Mexico\u2013United States border to \"concentration camps\". She cited \"expert analysis\", linking to an Esquire article quoting Andrea Pitzer, author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, who had made a similar claim.[184][185] Some academics supported Ocasio-Cortez's use of the term for the forced detention of immigrants;[186][187] other figures strongly criticized it, saying it showed disrespect for Holocaust victims.[188] In response to criticism from Republicans, Ocasio-Cortez said they had conflated concentration camps (\"the mass detention of civilians without trial\") with death camps.[189] She refused to apologize for using the term: \"If that makes you uncomfortable, fight the camps, not the nomenclature.\"[190] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez visited migrant detention centers and other facilities in Texas as part of a congressional delegation to witness the border crisis firsthand. Ocasio-Cortez described conditions she called \"horrifying.\" She said that women in one cell said they had not had access to showers for two weeks and were told to drink water from the toilet when their sink broke, and that one woman said that her daughters had been taken from her two weeks earlier and she did not know where they were.[191][192] Ocasio-Cortez supports transitioning to a single-payer healthcare system, viewing medical care as a human right.[193][194] She says that a single government health insurer should cover every American, reducing overall costs.[153] Her campaign website says, \"Almost every other developed nation in the world has universal healthcare. It's time the United States catch up to the rest of the world in ensuring all people have real healthcare coverage that doesn't break the bank.\"[194] The Medicare-for-all proposal has been adopted by many Democratic 2020 presidential contenders.[155] In September 2019, Ocasio-Cortez introduced an anti-poverty policy proposal (packaged in a bundle called \"A Just Society\") that would take into account the cost of childcare, health care, and \"new necessities\" like Internet access when measuring poverty. The proposal would cap annual rent increases and ensure access to social welfare programs for people with convictions and undocumented immigrants.[195] According to the U.S. Census about 40 million Americans live in poverty. Ocasio-Cortez is a proponent of LGBTQ rights and LGBTQ equality. She has said she supports the LGBTQ community and thanked its members for their role in her campaign.[196][157] She publicized and later appeared on a video game live stream to help raise money for Mermaids, a UK-based charity for trans children.[197] At the January 2019 New York City Women's March in Manhattan, Ocasio-Cortez gave a detailed speech in support of measures needed to ensure LGBTQ equality in the workplace and elsewhere.[198] She has also made a point of recognizing transgender rights, specifically saying, \"It's a no-brainer ... trans rights are civil rights are human rights.\"[199] Ocasio-Cortez has called for \"solidarity with Puerto Rico.\" She has advocated for granting Puerto Ricans further civil rights, regardless of Puerto Rico's legal classification. She advocates for voting rights and disaster relief. Ocasio-Cortez was critical of FEMA's response to Hurricane Maria and the federal government's unwillingness to address Puerto Rico's political status.[200] She believes the federal government should increase investment in Puerto Rico.[157] In May 2018, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Israel Defense Forces' use of deadly force against Palestinians participating in the 2018 Gaza border protests, calling it a \"massacre\" in a tweet.[214] In a July 2018 interview with the PBS series Firing Line, she said she is \"a proponent of a two-state solution\"[215] and called Israel's presence in the West Bank an \"occupation of Palestine.\"[216] Her use of the term \"occupation\" drew backlash from a number of pro-Israel groups and commentators.[217][218] Others defended her remarks, citing the United Nations' designation of the territory in the West Bank as occupied.[219][220] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez voted against a House resolution introduced by Democratic Congressman Brad Schneider of Illinois opposing the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel.[221] The resolution passed 398\u201317.[222] Ocasio-Cortez voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen.[223] She criticized President Trump's administration for escalating tensions with Iran.[224] The MIT Lincoln Laboratory named the asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez after her when she was a senior in high school in recognition of her second-place finish in the 2007 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.[20][21] Ocasio-Cortez was named the 2017 National Hispanic Institute Person of the Year by Ernesto Nieto.[9] In 2019, Ocasio-Cortez received PEN Oakland's Adelle Foley Award. Following the death of Ocasio-Cortez's father in 2008, her mother and grandmother relocated to Florida due to financial hardship.[13][28] She still has family in Puerto Rico, where her grandfather was living in a nursing home[200] before he died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.[225] She has said, \"to be Puerto Rican is to be the descendant of... African Moors [and] slaves, Taino Indians, Spanish colonizers, Jewish refugees, and likely others. We are all of these things and something else all at once\u2014we are Boricua.\"[15] Ocasio-Cortez discussed her Catholic faith and its impact on her life and her campaign for criminal justice reform in an article she wrote for America, the magazine of the Jesuit order in the United States.[226] At a December 2018 Hanukkah celebration in New York, she revealed that she has Sephardic Jewish ancestry, although she does not practice Judaism.[227] During the 2018 election campaign, Ocasio-Cortez resided in Parkchester, Bronx, with her boyfriend, web developer[228] Riley Roberts.[229][230][231]",

The district includes the eastern part of the Bronx and portions of north-central Queens in New York City. She is a member of the Democratic Party.\nOcasio-Cortez drew national recognition when she won the Democratic Party's primary election for New York's 14th congressional district on June 26, 2018. She defeated Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, in what was widely seen as the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterm election primaries.[2][3][4] She defeated Republican opponent Anthony Pappas in the November 6, 2018, general election. At age 29, Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman to serve in the United States Congress.[5] Ocasio-Cortez has been noted for her substantial social media presence relative to her fellow members of Congress.[6]\nOcasio-Cortez is among the first female members of the Democratic Socialists of America elected to serve in Congress.[7][8] Ocasio-Cortez advocates a progressive platform that includes Medicare for all, a federal jobs guarantee, a proposed Green New Deal, abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, free public college and trade school, and a 70% marginal tax rate for incomes above $10\u00a0million.\nOcasio-Cortez majored in international relations and economics at Boston University, graduating cum laude in 2011. She then worked as a waitress and bartender before running for Congress in 2018; she also served as an educational director for the five-day-long 2017 Northeast Collegiate World Series for the National Hispanic Institute.[9][10]\nOcasio-Cortez was born into a Catholic family in the Bronx borough of New York City on October 13, 1989, the daughter of Blanca Ocasio-Cortez (n\u00e9e Cortez) and Sergio Ocasio.[11] She has a younger brother named Gabriel.[12] Her father was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican family and became an architect; her mother was born in Puerto Rico.[13][14] She has described her Puerto Rican community as an amalgamation, stating, \"We are black; we are indigenous; we are Spanish; we are European.\"[15] Ocasio-Cortez lived with her family in an apartment in the Bronx neighborhood of Parkchester.[14] When she was five, the family moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights.[14][16]\nOcasio-Cortez attended Yorktown High School, graduating in 2007.[17] In high school and college, Ocasio-Cortez went by the name of \"Sandy\".[18] She came in second in the Microbiology category of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair with a microbiology research project on the effect of antioxidants on the lifespan of the nematode C. elegans.[19] In a show of appreciation for her efforts, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a small asteroid after her: 23238 Ocasio-Cortez.[20][21] In high school, she took part in the National Hispanic Institute's Lorenzo de Zavala (LDZ) Youth Legislative Session. She later became the LDZ Secretary of State while she attended Boston University. Ocasio-Cortez had a John F. Lopez Fellowship.[9]\nIn 2008, while Ocasio-Cortez was a sophomore at Boston University, her father died of lung cancer.[22][23] Ocasio-Cortez became involved in a lengthy probate battle to settle his estate. She has said that the experience helped her learn \"firsthand how attorneys appointed by the court to administer an estate can enrich themselves at the expense of the families struggling to make sense of the bureaucracy\".[24]\nDuring college, Ocasio-Cortez served as an intern for U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, in his section on foreign affairs and immigration issues.[25] She recalled, \"I was the only Spanish speaker, and as a result, as basically a kid\u2014a 19-, 20-year-old kid\u2014whenever a frantic call would come into the office because someone is looking for their husband because they have been snatched off the street by ICE, I was the one that had to pick up that phone. I was the one that had to help that person navigate that system.\"[25]\nOcasio-Cortez graduated cum laude from Boston University College of Arts and Sciences with a BA in 2011, majoring in international relations and economics.[9][26][27]\nAfter college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx and took a job as a bartender and waitress to help her mother\u2014a house cleaner and school bus driver\u2014fight foreclosure of their home.[28][10] She later launched Brook Avenue Press, a now-defunct publishing firm for books that portrayed the Bronx in a positive light.[29][30] Ocasio-Cortez also worked for the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute.[9][31][32]\nDuring the 2016 primary, Ocasio-Cortez worked as an organizer for Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign.[33] After the general election, she traveled across America by car, visiting places such as Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, and speaking to people affected by the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline.[34] In an interview she recalled her December 2016 visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point, saying that before that, she had believed that the only way to run for office effectively was to have access to wealth, social influence, and power. But her visit to North Dakota, where she saw others \"putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community\", inspired her to begin to work for her own community.[35] One day after she visited North Dakota, she got a phone call from Brand New Congress, which was recruiting progressive candidates (her brother had nominated her soon after Election Day 2016).[36]\nOcasio-Cortez began her campaign while waiting tables and tending bar at Flats Fix, a taqueria in New York City's Union Square.[37] \"For 80 percent of this campaign, I operated out of a paper grocery bag hidden behind that bar,\" she told Bon App\u00e9tit.[38] She was the first person since 2004 to challenge Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, in the primary. She faced a financial disadvantage, saying, \"You can't really beat big money with more money. You have to beat them with a totally different game.\"[39][40][24] Her campaign posters' design were said to have taken inspiration from \"revolutionary posters and visuals from the past\".[41]\nOn June 15, the candidates' only face-to-face encounter during the campaign occurred on a local political talk show, Inside City Hall. The format was a joint interview conducted by Errol Louis, which NY1 characterized as a debate.[42] On June 18, a debate in the Bronx was scheduled, but Crowley did not participate. He sent former New York City Council member Annabel Palma in his place.[43][44][45]\nOcasio-Cortez was endorsed by progressive and civil rights organizations such as MoveOn,[46] Black Lives Matter,[47] and Democracy for America,[33] and by actress and first-time candidate Cynthia Nixon.[48] Nixon, like Ocasio-Cortez, also challenged a longtime incumbent: she ran against Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 New York gubernatorial election[49] but lost by 66% to 34%.[50]\nGovernor Cuomo endorsed Crowley, as did both of New York's U.S. Senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, 11 U.S. Representatives, 31 local elected officials, 31 trade unions, and progressive groups such as the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood, the Working Families Party, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, among others.[51][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] California representative Ro Khanna, a Justice Democrat like Ocasio-Cortez,[52] initially endorsed Crowley but later endorsed Ocasio-Cortez in an unusual dual endorsement.[53]\nOn June 26, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez received 57.13% of the vote (15,897) to Joe Crowley's 42.5% (11,761), defeating the 10-term incumbent by almost 15 percentage points.[54] Her win, and Crowley's defeat, came as a shock to many political commentators and analysts and immediately garnered nationwide attention. Time called her victory \"the biggest upset of the 2018 elections so far\";[55] CNN made a similar statement.[3] The New York Times described Crowley's loss as \"a shocking primary defeat on Tuesday, the most significant loss for a Democratic incumbent in more than a decade, and one that will reverberate across the party and the country\".[33] The Guardian called it \"one of the biggest upsets in recent American political history\".[56] She was outspent by a margin of 18 to 1 ($1.5 million to $83,000) but won the endorsement of some influential groups on the party's far left.[57] Merriam-Webster reported that searches for the word \"socialism\" spiked 1,500% after her victory.[58] Crowley conceded defeat on election night,[59] but did not telephone Ocasio-Cortez that night to congratulate her, fueling short-lived speculation that he intended to run against her in the general election.[60]\nBernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky congratulated her.[61][62] Several commentators noted the similarities between Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Crowley and Dave Brat's Tea Party movement-supported 2014 victory over Eric Cantor in the Republican primary for Virginia's 7th congressional district.[63][64] Like Crowley, Cantor was a high-ranking member in his party's caucus.[65] After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed several progressive primary challengers to Democratic incumbents nationwide,[66] capitalizing on her fame and spending her political capital in a manner unusual even for unexpected primary winners.[67]\nWithout campaigning for it, Ocasio-Cortez won the Reform Party primary as a write-in candidate in a neighboring congressional district, New York's 15th, with a total vote count of nine, highest among all 22 write-in candidates. She declined the nomination.[68][69]\nOcasio-Cortez faced Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election.[70] Pappas, who lives in Astoria, is an economics professor at St. John's University. According to the New York Post, Pappas did not actively campaign. The Post wrote that \"Pappas' bid was a long shot,\" since the 14th has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29, making it the sixth most Democratic district in New York City. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost six to one.[71][72][73] The district and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands for all but two years since 1923 and without interruption since 1949.\nOcasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former President Barack Obama and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.[74][75] She spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in August 2018, and was called \"the undisputed star of the convention\".[76]\nCrowley also remained on the ballot, as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women's Equality Party (WEP). Neither Crowley nor the WFP party actively campaigned, with both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after her Democratic primary victory.[77] Ocasio-Cortez described the WEP, which Governor Cuomo created ahead of the 2014 New York gubernatorial election, as a cynical, centrist group that endorsed male incumbents over female challengers like her and Nixon.[78] Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who won reelection in 2006 on a third-party line after losing the Democratic Primary in 2006, penned a July 17 column in the Wall Street Journal expressing his hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line.[79] Dan Cantor, Executive Director of the WFP, wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the New York Daily News; he asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.[80]\nOcasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (110,318) to Pappas' 14% (17,762). Crowley, on the WFP and WEP lines, received 9,348 votes (6.6%). Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up 41 seats.[81] Saikat Chakrabarti, who had been her campaign co-chair, became chief of staff for her congressional office.[82] Co-creator of two progressive political action committees, he has been called a significant political presence.[83]\nAfter her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez quickly garnered nationwide media attention, including numerous articles and TV talk-show appearances. She also drew a great deal of media attention when she and Sanders campaigned for James Thompson in Kansas in July 2018. A rally in Wichita had to be moved from a theater with a capacity of 1,500 when far more people said they would attend. The event drew 4,000 people, with some seated on the floor. In The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote that while Sanders remained \"the de-facto leader of an increasingly popular left, [he is unable to] do things that do not come naturally to him, like supply hope\". Wallace-Wells suggested that Ocasio-Cortez had made Sanders's task easier, as he could point to her success to show that ideas \"once considered to be radical are now part of the mainstream\".[84]\nUntil she defeated incumbent Joe Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary, Ocasio-Cortez received little coverage on most traditional news media outlets.[85][86] Jimmy Dore interviewed her when she first announced her candidacy in June 2017.[87] After her primary win, Brian Stelter wrote that progressive-media outlets, such as The Young Turks and The Intercept, \"saw the Ocasio-Cortez upset coming\" in advance.[64] Margaret Sullivan wrote in The Washington Post that traditional metrics of measuring a campaign's viability, like total fundraising, were contributing to a \"media failure\".[86]\nOcasio-Cortez's campaign was featured on the cover of the June 2018 edition of The Indypendent,[88][89] a free New York City-based monthly newspaper. In a tweet she hailed the cover appearance on \"NYC's classic monthly\" as an important breakthrough for her campaign.[90] Otherwise Ocasio-Cortez was barely mentioned in print until her primary win.[91]\nOcasio-Cortez was one of the subjects of the 2018 Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 11/9; it chronicled her primary campaign.[92][93]\nIn an attempt to embarrass Ocasio-Cortez just before she took office, Twitter user \"AnonymousQ\" shared a video dating to Ocasio-Cortez's college years: a Boston University student-produced dance video in which she briefly appeared.[94] Many social media users came to her defense, inspiring memes and a Twitter account syncing the footage to songs like \"Mambo No. 5\" and \"Gangnam Style\".[95] Ocasio-Cortez responded by posting a \"lighthearted\" video of herself dancing to Edwin Starr's \"War\".[94]\nIn 2019, Elizabeth Warren wrote the entry on Ocasio-Cortez for that year's Time 100.[96] In January 2019 the documentary Knock Down the House, which focuses on four female Democrats in the 2018 United States elections who were not career politicians, including Ocasio-Cortez, Amy Vilela, Cori Bush, and Paula Jean Swearengin, premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Ocasio-Cortez was the only one of the women featured to win.[97][98] It was released by Netflix on May 1, 2019.[99]\nWhen the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez entered with no seniority but with a large social media presence. Axios has credited her with \"as much social media clout as her fellow freshman Democrats combined\".[6] As of April\u00a02019[update], she had 3.8\u00a0million Twitter followers,[100] up from 1.4\u00a0million in November 2018[6] and surpassing Nancy Pelosi.[101] By July 2019 that had risen to almost 4.8 million,[102] or about seven times the population of her congressional district. She had 2.2\u00a0million Instagram followers as of January 2019[103] and 500,000 followers on Facebook as of February 2019.[104] Her colleagues appointed her to teach them social media lessons upon her arrival in Congress.[104] In early July 2019 two lawsuits were filed against her for blocking Joseph Saladino and Dov Hikind on Twitter in light of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that it was a violation of the First Amendment for President Trump to block people on Twitter.[105][106] On November 4, 2019, it was announced that they settled the lawsuit with Ocasio-Cortez issuing a statement apologizing for the Twitter block.[107][108]\nIn an interview with the Yahoo! News podcast Skullduggery, Ocasio-Cortez said she had stopped using her private Facebook account and was minimizing her usage of all social media accounts and platforms, calling them a \"public health risk\".[109][110]\nIn November 2018, on the first day of congressional orientation, Ocasio-Cortez participated in a climate change protest outside the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[111] Also that month, she backed Pelosi's bid to be Speaker of the House once the Democratic Party reclaimed the majority on the condition that Pelosi \"remains the most progressive candidate for speaker\".[112]\nDuring the orientation for new members hosted by the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter in December 2018 about the influence of corporate interests by sponsors such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies: \"Lobbyists are here. Goldman Sachs is here. Where's labor? Activists? Frontline community leaders?\"[113][114][115]\nIn January 2019, when Ocasio-Cortez made her first speech on the floor of Congress, C-SPAN tweeted the video. Within 12 hours, the video of her four-minute speech set the record as C-SPAN's most-watched Twitter video by a member of the House of Representatives.[116]\nIn February 2019, speaking at a Congressional hearing with a panel of representatives from campaign finance watchdog groups, Ocasio-Cortez questioned the panel about ethics regulations as they apply to both the president and members of Congress. She asserted that no regulations prevent lawmakers \"from being bought off by wealthy corporations\".[117] With more than 37.5\u00a0million views, the clip became the most-watched political video posted on Twitter.[118]\nWhen President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen appeared before the Oversight Committee in February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez asked him whether Trump had inflated property values for bank or insurance purposes and inquired where to get more information on the subject.[119] Cohen's reply implied that Trump may have committed potential tax and bank fraud in his personal and business tax returns, financial statements and real-estate filings.[120][121] New York Times columnist David Brooks praised her for \"laying down specific questions for specific predicates\".[122]\nAccording to reports in March 2019, Ocasio-Cortez continued to receive media coverage early in her congressional tenure on a par with that of 2020 presidential candidates[123] and was considered \"one of the faces of the Democratic party\"[124] and one of the most talked-about politicians in the United States.[125] Between July 8 and July 14, 2019, she drew more social media attention than the Democratic presidential candidates. Tracking company NewsWhip found that interactions with news articles on Ocasio-Cortez numbered 4.8 million, while no Democratic presidential candidate got more than 1.2 million. David Bauder of the Associated Press wrote that Trump's supporters are thus having \"some success\" in having \"Ocasio-Cortez be top of mind when people think of\" the Democratic Party.[126]\nAccording to a Media Matters for America study, Ocasio-Cortez has been intensely discussed on sister television channels Fox News and Fox Business, being mentioned every day from February 25 to April 7, 2019, for a total of 3,181 mentions in 42 days (an average of around 75 per day). The Guardian's David Smith wrote that this is evidence that Fox is \"obsessed by Ocasio-Cortez, portraying her as a radical socialist who threatens the American way of life.\"[127] Brian Stelter of CNN Business found that between January to July 2019, she had nearly three times as many mentions on Fox News as on CNN and MSNBC, and seven times the coverage of James Clyburn, a Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. Stelter wrote that the attention Ocasio-Cortez is receiving has caused \"the perception, particularly on the right, that her positions and policies are representative of the Democratic Party as a whole\".[128] In a CBS News and YouGov poll of almost 2,100 American adults conducted from July 17 to 19, it was found that Republican respondents were more aware of Ocasio-Cortez than Democratic respondents. She had very unfavorable ratings among Republican respondents and favorable ratings among Democratic respondents.[129]\nOcasio-Cortez is a member of an informal group of progressive freshmen members of Congress called \"The Squad,\" along with Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).[130] On July 14, Trump attacked the Squad in a tweet, saying that they should \"go back and help fix\" the countries they came from rather than criticize the American government.[131] He continued to make the same kind of comment over the next several days, even though three of the women, including Ocasio-Cortez, were born in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet that \"the President's words [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color \"go back to your own country,\" is hallmark language of white supremacists.\" She later added, \"We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we propose the solutions to fix it.\"[132] Days later, Trump falsely asserted that Ocasio-Cortez called \"our country and our people 'garbage'\"; she had actually said that Americans should not be content with moderate policies that are \"10% better from garbage\".[133] Trump also falsely claimed that Ocasio-Cortez said \"illegal immigrants are more American\" than Americans who tried to keep them out; she actually said that \"women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and opportunity\" in America \"are acting more American\" than those who tried to keep them out.[134]\nIn March 2019, PolitiFact reported that Ocasio-Cortez is \"one of the most targeted politicians for hoax claims, despite the fact that she just entered Congress as a freshman\". Fake quotes attributed to her, fake photos of her, and false rumors about her have spread on social media. Some of these have originated from 4chan and r/The_Donald.[135] By July 2019 the fake material included attributing things Trump said to Ocasio-Cortez, such as \"I have a very good brain and I\u2019ve said lots of things.\"[136] On July 18, 2019, Charlie Rispoli, a police officer from Gretna, posted on Facebook an apparent threat to shoot Ocasio-Cortez, calling her a \"vile idiot\" who \"needs a round, and I don't mean the kind she used to serve\" as a bartender. Rispoli posted the comment in response to a fake news article that falsely quoted Ocasio-Cortez as saying \"We pay soldiers too much\". A photo from the article also had the label \"satire\".[137] Rispoli was fired for his post and his Facebook account was deleted.[138]\nOn February 7, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez submitted her first piece of legislation, the Green New Deal, to the Senate. She and Senator Ed Markey released a joint non-binding resolution laying out the main elements of a 10-year \"economic mobilization\" that would phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation's infrastructure. Their plan called for implementing the \"social cost of carbon\" that was part of the Obama administration's plans to address climate change. In the process it aimed to create jobs and boost the economy.[139] According to CNBC, an initial outline the Green New Deal called for \"completely ditching fossil fuels, upgrading or replacing 'every building' in the country and 'totally overhaul[ing] transportation' to the point where 'air travel stops becoming necessary'\". The outline set a goal of having the U.S. \"creating 'net-zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years. Why 'net zero'? The lawmakers explained: 'We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.'\"[140] Activist groups such as Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement came out in favor of the plan. No Republican lawmakers voiced support.[141][142] The plan gained support from some Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker;[143] other Democrats, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the proposal (Pelosi has referred to it as \"the green dream, or whatever they call it\").[144]\nOn March 26, in what Democrats called a \"stunt\", Senate Republicans called for an early vote on the Green New Deal without allowing discussion or expert testimony. Markey said Republicans were trying to \"make a mockery\" of the Green New Deal debate and called the vote a \"sham\". In protest, Senate Democrats voted \"present\" or against the bill, resulting in a 57\u20130 defeat on the Senate floor.[145][146] In March 2019, a group of UK activists proposed that the Labour Party adopt a similar plan, \"Labour for a Green New Deal.\" The group said it was inspired by the Sunrise Movement and the work Ocasio-Cortez has done in the US.[147]\nOcasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America[7] and embraces the democratic socialist label as part of her political identity. In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, she described democratic socialism as \"part of what I am. It's not all of what I am. And I think that that's a very important distinction.\"[150] In response to a question about democratic socialism ultimately calling for an end to capitalism during a Firing Line interview on PBS, she answered: \"Ultimately, we are marching towards progress on this issue. I do think that we are going to see an evolution in our economic system of an unprecedented degree, and it's hard to say what direction that that takes.\"[151]\n\nOcasio-Cortez supports progressive policies such as single-payer Medicare for All, tuition-free public college and trade school,[152] a federal job guarantee,[153] the cancellation of all $1.6 trillion of outstanding student debt,[154] guaranteed family leave,[155] abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,[156] ending the privatization of prisons, enacting gun-control policies,[157] and energy policy relying on 100% renewables.[158]She is open to using Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) as an economic pathway that could provide funding and enable implementation of these goals.[159] Ocasio-Cortez rejects the state socialist politics and economics of Cuba, the Soviet Union and Venezuela, and favors policies that \"most closely resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden.\"[160][161]\nOcasio-Cortez has endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential election and has been appearing with him at speaking engagements. Campaign rallies she has attended with him have drawn the largest crowds of any presidential rally. On January 25, she joined Michael Moore to fill in for Sanders at a rally at the University of Iowa while Sanders was attending the Senate's Trump impeachment trial.[162][163]\nOcasio-Cortez has called for \"more environmental hardliners in Congress,\"[164] describing climate change as \"the single biggest national security threat for the United States and the single biggest threat to worldwide industrialized civilization.\"[165] Referring to a recent United Nations report indicating that the effects of climate change will be irreversible unless carbon emissions are reined in over the next 12 years, she said, \"Millennials and people\u2014you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and we\u2019re like: \u2018The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don\u2019t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'\"[166][167][168]\nOcasio-Cortez's environmental plan, termed the Green New Deal, advocates for the United States to transition to an electrical grid running on 100% renewable energy[143] and to end the use of fossil fuels within 10 years. The changes, estimated to cost roughly $2.5 trillion per year, would be financed in part by higher taxes on the wealthy.[169][170][171]\nOcasio-Cortez proposed introducing a marginal tax as high as 70% on income above $10\u00a0million to pay for the Green New Deal. According to tax experts contacted by The Washington Post, this tax would bring in extra revenue of $720\u00a0billion per decade.[172][173] Ocasio-Cortez has opposed and voted against the pay-as-you-go rule supported by Democratic leaders, which requires deficit-neutral fiscal policy, with all new expenditures balanced by tax increases or spending cuts. She and Representative Ro Khanna have condemned the rule as hamstringing new or expanded progressive policies.[174][175] She cites Modern Monetary Theory as a justification for higher deficits to finance her agenda.[159][176] Drawing a parallel with the Great Depression, she has argued that the Green New Deal needs deficit spending like the original New Deal.[164]\nOcasio-Cortez has expressed support for defunding and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency on multiple occasions. In February 2018 she called it \"a product of the Bush-era Patriot Act suite of legislation\" and \"an enforcement agency that takes on more of a paramilitary tone every single day\".[177][178] That June she said she would \"stop short of fully disbanding the agency,\" and would rather \"create a pathway to citizenship for more immigrants through decriminalization.\"[179] She later clarified that this does not mean ceasing all deportations.[180] She has called the Department of Homeland Security's immigration detention centers \"black sites\", citing limited public access to them.[181] Two days before the primary election, Ocasio-Cortez attended a protest at an ICE child-detention center in Tornillo, Texas.[182] She was the only Democrat to vote against H.R. 648, a bill to fund and reopen the government, because it funded ICE.[183]\nIn June 2019, Ocasio-Cortez compared the detention centers for undocumented immigrants at the Mexico\u2013United States border to \"concentration camps\". She cited \"expert analysis\", linking to an Esquire article quoting Andrea Pitzer, author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, who had made a similar claim.[184][185] Some academics supported Ocasio-Cortez's use of the term for the forced detention of immigrants;[186][187] other figures strongly criticized it, saying it showed disrespect for Holocaust victims.[188] In response to criticism from Republicans, Ocasio-Cortez said they had conflated concentration camps (\"the mass detention of civilians without trial\") with death camps.[189] She refused to apologize for using the term: \"If that makes you uncomfortable, fight the camps, not the nomenclature.\"[190]\nIn July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez visited migrant detention centers and other facilities in Texas as part of a congressional delegation to witness the border crisis firsthand. Ocasio-Cortez described conditions she called \"horrifying.\" She said that women in one cell said they had not had access to showers for two weeks and were told to drink water from the toilet when their sink broke, and that one woman said that her daughters had been taken from her two weeks earlier and she did not know where they were.[191][192]\nOcasio-Cortez supports transitioning to a single-payer healthcare system, viewing medical care as a human right.[193][194] She says that a single government health insurer should cover every American, reducing overall costs.[153] Her campaign website says, \"Almost every other developed nation in the world has universal healthcare. It's time the United States catch up to the rest of the world in ensuring all people have real healthcare coverage that doesn't break the bank.\"[194] The Medicare-for-all proposal has been adopted by many Democratic 2020 presidential contenders.[155]\nIn September 2019, Ocasio-Cortez introduced an anti-poverty policy proposal (packaged in a bundle called \"A Just Society\") that would take into account the cost of childcare, health care, and \"new necessities\" like Internet access when measuring poverty. The proposal would cap annual rent increases and ensure access to social welfare programs for people with convictions and undocumented immigrants.[195] According to the U.S. Census about 40 million Americans live in poverty.\nOcasio-Cortez is a proponent of LGBTQ rights and LGBTQ equality. She has said she supports the LGBTQ community and thanked its members for their role in her campaign.[196][157] She publicized and later appeared on a video game live stream to help raise money for Mermaids, a UK-based charity for trans children.[197] At the January 2019 New York City Women's March in Manhattan, Ocasio-Cortez gave a detailed speech in support of measures needed to ensure LGBTQ equality in the workplace and elsewhere.[198] She has also made a point of recognizing transgender rights, specifically saying, \"It's a no-brainer ... trans rights are civil rights are human rights.\"[199]\nOcasio-Cortez has called for \"solidarity with Puerto Rico.\" She has advocated for granting Puerto Ricans further civil rights, regardless of Puerto Rico's legal classification. She advocates for voting rights and disaster relief. Ocasio-Cortez was critical of FEMA's response to Hurricane Maria and the federal government's unwillingness to address Puerto Rico's political status.[200] She believes the federal government should increase investment in Puerto Rico.[157]\nIn May 2018, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Israel Defense Forces' use of deadly force against Palestinians participating in the 2018 Gaza border protests, calling it a \"massacre\" in a tweet.[214] In a July 2018 interview with the PBS series Firing Line, she said she is \"a proponent of a two-state solution\"[215] and called Israel's presence in the West Bank an \"occupation of Palestine.\"[216] Her use of the term \"occupation\" drew backlash from a number of pro-Israel groups and commentators.[217][218] Others defended her remarks, citing the United Nations' designation of the territory in the West Bank as occupied.[219][220] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez voted against a House resolution introduced by Democratic Congressman Brad Schneider of Illinois opposing the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel.[221] The resolution passed 398\u201317.[222]\nOcasio-Cortez voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen.[223] She criticized President Trump's administration for escalating tensions with Iran.[224]\nThe MIT Lincoln Laboratory named the asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez after her when she was a senior in high school in recognition of her second-place finish in the 2007 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.[20][21] Ocasio-Cortez was named the 2017 National Hispanic Institute Person of the Year by Ernesto Nieto.[9] In 2019, Ocasio-Cortez received PEN Oakland's Adelle Foley Award.\nFollowing the death of Ocasio-Cortez's father in 2008, her mother and grandmother relocated to Florida due to financial hardship.[13][28] She still has family in Puerto Rico, where her grandfather was living in a nursing home[200] before he died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.[225] She has said, \"to be Puerto Rican is to be the descendant of... African Moors [and] slaves, Taino Indians, Spanish colonizers, Jewish refugees, and likely others. We are all of these things and something else all at once\u2014we are Boricua.\"[15]\nOcasio-Cortez discussed her Catholic faith and its impact on her life and her campaign for criminal justice reform in an article she wrote for America, the magazine of the Jesuit order in the United States.[226] At a December 2018 Hanukkah celebration in New York, she revealed that she has Sephardic Jewish ancestry, although she does not practice Judaism.[227]\nDuring the 2018 election campaign, Ocasio-Cortez resided in Parkchester, Bronx, with her boyfriend, web developer[228] Riley Roberts.[229][230][231]\n</body></html>"
