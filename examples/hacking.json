                "text": "no title\n\nKeith Rupert Murdoch, AC, KCSG (born 11 March 1931) is an Australian-born American media mogul who founded News Corp.[3] Murdoch's father, Sir Keith Murdoch, was a reporter and editor who became a senior executive of The Herald and Weekly Times publishing company, covering all Australian states except New South Wales.[4] After his father's death in 1952, Murdoch declined to join his late father's registered media public company and created his own private company, News Limited. In the 1950s and 1960s, Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969, taking over the News of the World, followed closely by The Sun. In 1974, Murdoch moved to New York City, to expand into the U.S. market; however, he retained interests in Australia and Britain. In 1981, Murdoch bought The Times, his first British broadsheet and, in 1985, became a naturalized U.S. citizen, giving up his Australian citizenship, to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television network ownership.[5] In 1986, keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies, Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping, causing bitter industrial disputes. His holding company News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox (1985), HarperCollins (1989),[6] and The Wall Street Journal (2007). Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 and, during the 1990s, expanded into Asian networks and South American television. By 2000, Murdoch's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries, with a net worth of over $5 billion. In July 2011, Murdoch faced allegations that his companies, including the News of the World, owned by News Corporation, had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities, royalty, and public citizens. Murdoch faced police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S.[7][8] On 21 July 2012, Murdoch resigned as a director of News International.[9][10] On 1 July 2015, Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox.[11] However, Murdoch and his family would continue to own both 21st Century Fox until 2019 and News Corp through the Murdoch Family Trust until 20th Century Fox itself was purchased by Disney.[12][13][14][15] In July 2016, after the resignation of Roger Ailes due to accusations of sexual harassment, Murdoch was named the acting CEO of Fox News.[16][17] Keith Rupert Murdoch was born on 11 March 1931 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the son of Sir Keith Murdoch (1885\u20131952) and Dame Elisabeth Murdoch (n\u00e9e Greene; 1909\u20132012). He is of English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Murdoch's parents were also born in Melbourne. Keith Murdoch was a war correspondent and later a regional newspaper magnate owning two newspapers in Adelaide, South Australia, and a radio station in a faraway mining town, and chairman of the powerful Herald and Weekly Times group.[5][18]:16 Later in life, Keith Rupert chose to go by his second name, the first name of his maternal grandfather. Keith Murdoch the elder asked to meet with his future wife after seeing her debutante photograph in one of his own newspapers and they married in 1928, when she was aged 19 and he was 23 years older.[19] In addition to Rupert, the couple had three daughters: Janet Calvert-Jones, Anne Kantor and Helen Handbury (1929\u20132004). Murdoch attended Geelong Grammar School,[20] where he was co-editor of the school's official journal The Corian and editor of the student journal If Revived.[21][22] He took his school's cricket team to the National Junior Finals. He worked part-time at the Melbourne Herald and was groomed by his father to take over the family business.[5][23] Murdoch studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Worcester College, Oxford in England, where he kept a bust of Lenin in his rooms and came to be known as \"Red Rupert\". He was a member of the Oxford University Labour Party,[18]:34[23] stood for Secretary of the Labour Club[24] and managed Oxford Student Publications Limited, the publishing house of Cherwell.[25] After his father's death from cancer in 1952, his mother Elisabeth did charity work as life governor of the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne and established the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute. At the age of 102 (in 2011), she had 74 descendants.[19] Murdoch completed an MA before working as a sub-editor with the Daily Express for two years.[5] Following his father's death, when he was 21, Murdoch returned from Oxford to take charge of what was left of the family business. After liquidation of his father's Herald stake to pay taxes, what was left was News Limited, which had been established in 1923.[18]:16 Rupert Murdoch turned its Adelaide newspaper, The News, its main asset, into a major success.[23] He began to direct his attention to acquisition and expansion, buying the troubled Sunday Times in Perth, Western Australia (1956) and over the next few years acquiring suburban and provincial newspapers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory, including the Sydney afternoon tabloid, The Daily Mirror (1960). The Economist describes Murdoch as \"inventing the modern tabloid\",[26] as he developed a pattern for his newspapers, increasing sports and scandal coverage and adopting eye-catching headlines.[5] Murdoch's first foray outside Australia involved the purchase of a controlling interest in the New Zealand daily The Dominion. In January 1964, while touring New Zealand with friends in a rented Morris Minor after sailing across the Tasman, Murdoch read of a takeover bid for the Wellington paper by the British-based Canadian newspaper magnate, Lord Thomson of Fleet. On the spur of the moment, he launched a counter-bid. A four-way battle for control ensued in which the 32-year-old Murdoch was ultimately successful.[27] Later in 1964, Murdoch launched The Australian, Australia's first national daily newspaper, which was based first in Canberra and later in Sydney.[28] In 1972, Murdoch acquired the Sydney morning tabloid The Daily Telegraph from Australian media mogul Sir Frank Packer, who later regretted selling it to him.[29] In 1984, Murdoch was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for services to publishing.[30] In 1999, Murdoch significantly expanded his music holdings in Australia by acquiring the controlling share in a leading Australian independent label, Michael Gudinski's Mushroom Records; he merged that with Festival Records, and the result was Festival Mushroom Records (FMR). Both Festival and FMR were managed by Murdoch's son James Murdoch for several years.[31] Murdoch found a political ally in Sir John McEwen, leader of the Australian Country Party (now known as the National Party of Australia), who was governing in coalition with the larger Menzies-Holt-Gorton Liberal Party. From the very first issue of The Australian Murdoch began taking McEwen's side in every issue that divided the long-serving coalition partners. (The Australian, 15 July 1964, first edition, front page: \"Strain in Cabinet, Liberal-CP row flares.\") It was an issue that threatened to split the coalition government and open the way for the stronger Australian Labor Party to dominate Australian politics. It was the beginning of a long campaign that served McEwen well.[32] After McEwen and Menzies retired, Murdoch threw his growing power behind the Australian Labor Party under the leadership of Gough Whitlam and duly saw it elected[33] on a social platform that included universal free health care, free education for all Australians to tertiary level, recognition of the People's Republic of China, and public ownership of Australia's oil, gas and mineral resources. Rupert Murdoch's backing of Whitlam turned out to be brief. Murdoch had already started his short-lived National Star[32] newspaper in America, and was seeking to strengthen his political contacts there.[34] Asked about the 2007 Australian federal election at News Corporation's annual general meeting in New York on 19 October 2007, its chairman Rupert Murdoch said, \"I am not commenting on anything to do with Australian politics. I'm sorry. I always get into trouble when I do that.\" Pressed as to whether he believed Prime Minister John Howard should continue as prime minister, he said: \"I have nothing further to say. I'm sorry. Read our editorials in the papers. It'll be the journalists who decide that \u2013 the editors.\"[35] In 2009, in response to accusations by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that News Limited was running vendettas against him and his government, Murdoch opined that Rudd was \"oversensitive\".[36] Murdoch described Howard's successor, Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as \"...more ambitious to lead the world [in tackling climate change] than to lead Australia...\" and criticised Rudd's expansionary fiscal policies in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 as unnecessary.[37] Although News Limited's interests are extensive, also including the Daily Telegraph, the Courier-Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser, it was suggested by the commentator Mungo MacCallum in The Monthly that \"the anti-Rudd push, if coordinated at all, was almost certainly locally driven\" as opposed to being directed by Murdoch, who also took a different position from local editors on such matters as climate change and stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis.[38] Murdoch is a supporter of an Australian republic, having campaigned for one during the 1999 referendum.[39] In 1968, Murdoch entered the British newspaper market with his acquisition of the populist News of the World, followed in 1969 with the purchase of the struggling daily The Sun from IPC.[40] Murdoch turned The Sun into a tabloid format and reduced costs by using the same printing press for both newspapers. On acquiring it, he appointed Albert 'Larry' Lamb as editor and \u2013 Lamb recalled later \u2013 told him: \"I want a tearaway paper with lots of tits in it\". In 1997 The Sun attracted 10 million daily readers.[5] In 1981, Murdoch acquired the struggling Times and Sunday Times from Canadian newspaper publisher Lord Thomson of Fleet.[40] Ownership of The Times came to him through his relationship with Lord Thomson, who had grown tired of losing money on it as a result of an extended period of industrial action that stopped publication.[41] In the light of success and expansion at The Sun the owners believed that Murdoch could turn the papers around. Harold Evans, editor of the Sunday Times from 1967, was switched to the daily Times, though he stayed only a year amid editorial conflict with Murdoch.[42][43] During the 1980s and early 1990s, Murdoch's publications were generally supportive of Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[44] At the end of the Thatcher/Major era, Murdoch switched his support to the Labour Party and its leader, Tony Blair. The closeness of his relationship with Blair and their secret meetings to discuss national policies was to become a political issue in Britain.[45] This later changed, with The Sun, in its English editions, publicly renouncing the ruling Labour government and lending its support to David Cameron's Conservative Party, which soon afterwards formed a coalition government. In Scotland, where the Tories had suffered a complete annihilation in 1997, the paper began to endorse the Scottish National Party (though not yet its flagship policy of independence), which soon after came to form the first ever outright majority in the proportionally elected Scottish Parliament. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's official spokesman said in November 2009 that Brown and Murdoch \"were in regular communication\" and that \"there is nothing unusual in the prime minister talking to Rupert Murdoch\".[46] In 1986, Murdoch introduced electronic production processes to his newspapers in Australia, Britain and the United States. The greater degree of automation led to significant reductions in the number of employees involved in the printing process. In England, the move roused the anger of the print unions, resulting in a long and often violent dispute that played out in Wapping, one of London's docklands areas, where Murdoch had installed the very latest electronic newspaper purpose-built publishing facility in an old warehouse.[47] The bitter Wapping dispute started with the dismissal of 6,000 employees who had gone on strike and resulted in street battles and demonstrations. Many on the political left in Britain alleged the collusion of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government with Murdoch in the Wapping affair, as a way of damaging the British trade union movement.[48][49][50] In 1987, the dismissed workers accepted a settlement of \u00a360 million.[5] Murdoch's British-based satellite network, Sky Television, incurred massive losses in its early years of operation. As with many of his other business interests, Sky was heavily subsidised by the profits generated by his other holdings, but convinced rival satellite operator British Satellite Broadcasting to accept a merger on his terms in 1990.[5] The merged company, BSkyB, has dominated the British pay-TV market ever since pursuing direct to home (DTH) satellite broadcasting.[51] By 1996, BSkyB had more than 3.6 million subscribers, triple the number of cable customers in the UK.[5] Murdoch has a seat on the Strategic Advisory Board of Genie Oil and Gas, having jointly investing with Lord Rothschild in a 5.5% stake in the company which conducted shale gas and oil exploration in Colorado, Mongolia, Israel and, controversially, the occupied Golan Heights.[52] In response to print media's decline and the increasing influence of online journalism during the 2000s, Murdoch proclaimed his support of the micropayments model for obtaining revenue from on-line news,[53] although this has been criticised by some.[54] In January 2018, the CMA blocked Murdoch from taking over the remaining 61% of BSkyB he did not already own, over fear of market dominance that could potentialise censorship of the media. His bid for BSkyB was later approved by the CMA as long as he sold Sky News to The Walt Disney Company, who was already set to acquire 21st Century Fox. However, it was Comcast who won control of BSkyB in a blind auction ordered by the CMA. Murdoch ultimately sold his 39% of BSkyB to Comcast. News Corporation has subsidiaries in the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the Channel Islands and the Virgin Islands. From 1986, News Corporation's annual tax bill averaged around seven percent of its profits.[55] In Britain, in the 1980s, Murdoch formed a close alliance with Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and The Sun credited itself with helping her successor John Major to win an unexpected election victory in the 1992 general election, which had been expected to end in a hung parliament or a narrow win for Labour, then led by Neil Kinnock.[56] In the general elections of 1997, 2001 and 2005, Murdoch's papers were either neutral or supported Labour under Tony Blair.[citation needed] The Labour Party, from when Tony Blair became leader in 1994, had moved from the Left to a more centrist position on many economic issues prior to 1997. Murdoch identifies himself as a libertarian, saying \"What does libertarian mean? As much individual responsibility as possible, as little government as possible, as few rules as possible. But I'm not saying it should be taken to the absolute limit.\"[57] In 1998, Murdoch made an attempt to buy the football club Manchester United F.C.,[58] with an offer of \u00a3625\u00a0million, but this failed. It was the largest amount ever offered for a sports club. It was blocked by the United Kingdom's Competition Commission, which stated that the acquisition would have \"hurt competition in the broadcast industry and the quality of British football\". In a speech he delivered in New York in 2005, Murdoch said that Blair described the BBC coverage of the Hurricane Katrina disaster as being full of hatred of America.[59] On 28 June 2006, the BBC reported that Murdoch and News Corporation were considering backing new Conservative leader David Cameron at the next General Election \u2013 still up to four years away.[60] In a later interview in July 2006, when he was asked what he thought of the Conservative leader, Murdoch replied \"Not much\".[61] In a 2009 blog, it was suggested that in the aftermath of the News of the World phone hacking scandal which might yet have Transatlantic implications[62] Murdoch and News Corporation might have decided to back Cameron.[63] Despite this, there had already been a convergence of interests between the two men over the muting of Britain's communications regulator Ofcom.[64] In August 2008, British Conservative leader and future Prime Minister David Cameron accepted free flights to hold private talks and attend private parties with Murdoch on his yacht, the Rosehearty.[65] Cameron declared in the Commons register of interests he accepted a private plane provided by Murdoch's son-in-law, public relations guru Matthew Freud; Cameron did not reveal his talks with Murdoch. The gift of travel in Freud's Gulfstream IV private jet was valued at around \u00a330,000. Other guests attending the \"social events\" included the then EU trade commissioner Lord Mandelson, the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and co-chairman of NBC Universal Ben Silverman. The Conservatives did not disclose what was discussed.[66] In July 2011, it emerged that Cameron had met key executives of Murdoch's News Corporation a total of 26 times during the 14 months that Cameron had served as Prime Minister up to that point.[67] It was also reported that Murdoch had given Cameron a personal guarantee that there would be no risk attached to hiring Andy Coulson, the former editor of News of the World, as the Conservative Party's communication director in 2007.[68] This was in spite of Coulson having resigned as editor over phone hacking by a reporter. Cameron chose to take Murdoch's advice, despite warnings from Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Lord Ashdown and The Guardian.[69] Coulson resigned his post in 2011 and was later arrested and questioned on allegations of further criminal activity at the News of the World, specifically the News International phone hacking scandal. As a result of the subsequent trial, Coulson was sentenced to 18 months in jail.[70] In June 2016, The Sun supported Vote Leave in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. Murdoch called the Brexit result \"wonderful\", comparing the decision to withdraw from the EU as like \"a prison break\u2026.we're out\".[71] In July 2011, Murdoch, along with his son James, provided testimony before a British parliamentary committee regarding phone hacking. In the UK, his media empire remains under fire, as investigators continue to probe reports of other phone hacking.[72] On 14 July, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons served a summons on Murdoch, his son James, and his former CEO Rebekah Brooks to testify before a committee five days later.[73] After an initial refusal, the Murdochs confirmed they would attend, after the committee issued them a summons to Parliament.[74] The day before the committee, the website of the News Corporation publication The Sun was hacked, and a false story was posted on the front page claiming that Murdoch had died.[75] Murdoch described the day of the committee \"the most humble day of my life\". He argued that since he ran a global business of 53,000 employees and that News of the World was \"just 1%\" of this, he was not ultimately responsible for what went on at the tabloid. He added that he had not considered resigning,[76] and that he and the other top executives had been completely unaware of the hacking.[77][78] On 15 July, Murdoch attended a private meeting in London with the family of Milly Dowler, where he personally apologized for the hacking of their murdered daughter's voicemail by a company he owns.[79][80] On 16 and 17 July, News International published two full-page apologies in many of Britain's national newspapers. The first apology took the form of a letter, signed by Murdoch, in which he said sorry for the \"serious wrongdoing\" that occurred. The second was titled \"Putting right what's gone wrong\", and gave more detail about the steps News International was taking to address the public's concerns.[80] In the wake of the allegations, Murdoch accepted the resignations of Rebekah Brooks, head of Murdoch's British operations, and Les Hinton, head of Dow Jones who was chairman of Murdoch's British newspaper division when some of the abuses happened. They both deny any knowledge of any wrongdoing under their command.[81] On 27 February 2012, the day after the first issue of The Sun on Sunday was published, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers informed the Leveson Inquiry that police are investigating a \"network of corrupt officials\" as part of their inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption. She said that evidence suggested a \"culture of illegal payments\" at The Sun and that these payments allegedly made by The Sun were authorised at a senior level.[82] In testimony on 25 April, Murdoch did not deny the quote attributed to him by his former editor of The Sunday Times, Harold Evans: \"I give instructions to my editors all round the world, why shouldn't I in London?\"[83][84] On 1 May 2012, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee issued a report stating that Murdoch was \"not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company\".[85][86] On 3 July 2013, the Exaro website and Channel 4 News broke the story of a secret recording. This was recorded by The Sun journalists, and in it Murdoch can be heard telling them that the whole investigation was one big fuss over nothing, and that he, or his successors, would take care of any journalists who went to prison.[87] He said: \"Why are the police behaving in this way? It's the biggest inquiry ever, over next to nothing.\"[88] Murdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the San Antonio Express-News. In 1974, Murdoch moved to New York City, to expand into the U.S. market; however, he retained interests in Australia and Britain. Soon afterwards, he founded Star, a supermarket tabloid, and in 1976, he purchased the New York Post.[5] On 4 September 1985, Murdoch became a naturalized citizen to satisfy the legal requirement that only US citizens were permitted to own US television stations. This resulted in Murdoch, in effect, renouncing his Australian citizenship.[89][90] In March 1984, Marvin Davis sold Marc Rich's interest in 20th Century Fox to Murdoch for $250 million due to Marc Rich's trade deals with Iran, which were sanctioned by the United States at the time. Marvin Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase John Kluge's Metromedia television stations.[91] Rupert Murdoch bought the stations by himself, without Marvin Davis, and later bought out Davis's remaining stake in Fox for $325 million.[91] The six television stations owned by Metromedia formed the nucleus of the Fox Broadcasting Company, founded on 9 October 1986, which later had great success with programs including The Simpsons and The X-Files.[5] In 1986 Murdoch bought Misty Mountain, a Wallace Neff designed house on Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills. The house was the former residence of Jules C. Stein. Murdoch sold the house to his son James in 2018.[92] In Australia, during 1987, he bought The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd., the company that his father had once managed. Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox bought out the remaining assets of Four Star Television from Ronald Perelman's Compact Video in 1996.[93] Most of Four Star Television's library of programs are controlled by 20th Century Fox Television today.[94][95][96] After Murdoch's numerous buyouts during the buyout era of the eighties, News Corporation had built up financial debts of $7 billion (much from Sky TV in the UK), despite the many assets that were held by NewsCorp.[5] The high levels of debt caused Murdoch to sell many of the American magazine interests he had acquired in the mid-1980s. In 1993, Murdoch's Fox Network took exclusive coverage of the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL) from CBS and increased programming to seven days a week.[97] In 1995, Fox became the object of scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), when it was alleged that News Ltd.'s Australian base made Murdoch's ownership of Fox illegal. However, the FCC ruled in Murdoch's favour, stating that his ownership of Fox was in the best interests of the public. That same year, Murdoch announced a deal with MCI Communications to develop a major news website and magazine, The Weekly Standard. Also that year, News Corporation launched the Foxtel pay television network in Australia in partnership with Telstra. In 1996, Murdoch decided to enter the cable news market with the Fox News Channel, a 24-hour cable news station. Ratings studies released in 2009 showed that the network was responsible for nine of the top ten programs in the \"Cable News\" category at that time.[98] Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner (founder and former owner of CNN) are long-standing rivals.[99] In late 2003, Murdoch acquired a 34% stake in Hughes Electronics, the operator of the largest American satellite TV system, DirecTV, from General Motors for $6\u00a0billion (USD).[30] His Fox movie studio had global hits with Titanic and Avatar.[100] In 2004, Murdoch announced that he was moving News Corporation headquarters from Adelaide, Australia to the United States. Choosing a US domicile was designed to ensure that American fund managers could purchase shares in the company, since many were deciding not to buy shares in non-US companies.[citation needed] On 20 July 2005, News Corporation bought Intermix Media Inc., which held Myspace, Imagine Games Network and other social networking-themed websites, for US$580\u00a0million, making Murdoch a major player in online media concerns.[101] In June 2011, it sold off Myspace for US$35 million.[102] On 11 September 2005, News Corporation announced that it would buy IGN Entertainment for $650\u00a0million (USD).[103] In May 2007, Murdoch made a $5\u00a0billion offer to purchase Dow Jones & Company. At the time, the Bancroft family, who had owned Dow Jones & Company for 105 years and controlled 64% of the shares at the time, declined the offer. Later, the Bancroft family confirmed a willingness to consider a sale. Besides Murdoch, the Associated Press reported that supermarket magnate Ron Burkle and Internet entrepreneur Brad Greenspan were among the other interested parties.[104] In 2007, Murdoch acquired Dow Jones & Company,[105][106] which gave him such publications as The Wall Street Journal, Barron's Magazine, the Far Eastern Economic Review (based in Hong Kong) and SmartMoney.[107] In June 2014, Murdoch's 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[108] On 5 August 2014 the company announced it had withdrawn its offer for Time Warner, and said it would spend $6 billion buying back its own shares over the following 12 months.[109] McNight (2010) identifies four characteristics of his media operations: free market ideology; unified positions on matters of public policy; global editorial meetings; and opposition to liberal bias in other public media.[110] On 8 May 2006, the Financial Times reported that Murdoch would be hosting a fund-raiser for Senator Hillary Clinton's (D-New York) Senate re-election campaign.[111] In a 2008 interview with Walt Mossberg, Murdoch was asked whether he had \"anything to do with the New York Post's endorsement of Barack Obama in the democratic primaries\". Without hesitating, Murdoch replied, \"Yeah. He is a rock star. It's fantastic. I love what he is saying about education. I don't think he will win Florida [...] but he will win in Ohio and the election. I am anxious to meet him. I want to see if he will walk the walk.\"[112][113] Murdoch is a strong supporter of Israel and its domestic policies.[114] In 2010, News Corporation gave US$1 million to the Republican Governors Association and $1 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[115][116][117] Murdoch also served on the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute.[118] Murdoch is also a supporter of the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act.[119] Murdoch advocates more open immigration policies in western nations generally.[120] In the United States, Murdoch and chief executives from several major corporations, including Hewlett-Packard, Boeing and Disney joined New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to form the Partnership for a New American Economy to advocate \"for immigration reform \u2013 including a path to legal status for all illegal aliens now in the United States\".[121] The coalition, reflecting Murdoch and Bloomberg's own views, also advocates significant increases in legal immigration to the United States as a means of boosting America's sluggish economy and lowering unemployment. The Partnership's immigration policy prescriptions are notably similar to those of the Cato Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce \u2014 both of which Murdoch has supported in the past.[122] The Wall Street Journal editorial page has similarly advocated for increased legal immigration, in contrast to the staunch anti-immigration stance of Murdoch's British newspaper, The Sun.[123] On 5 September 2010, Murdoch testified before the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Membership on the \"Role of Immigration in Strengthening America's Economy\". In his testimony, Murdoch called for ending mass deportations and endorsed a \"comprehensive immigration reform\" plan that would include a pathway to citizenship for all illegal immigrants.[121] In the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Murdoch was critical of the competence of Mitt Romney's team but was nonetheless strongly supportive of a Republican victory, tweeting: \"Of course I want him [Romney] to win, save us from socialism, etc.\"[124] In May 2013, Murdoch purchased the Moraga Estate, an estate, vineyard and winery in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.[125][126][127] In October 2015, Murdoch stirred controversy when he praised Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and referenced President Barack Obama, tweeting, \"Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide? And much else.\"[128] After which he apologized, tweeting, \"Apologies! No offence meant. Personally find both men charming.\"[129] Since Donald Trump became the US President, Murdoch has shown support for him through the news stories broadcast in his media empire, including on Fox News.[130] In early 2018, Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, had an intimate dinner at Murdoch's Bel Air estate in Los Angeles.[131] Murdoch owns controlling interest in Sky Italia, a satellite television provider in Italy.[132] Murdoch's business interests in Italy have been a source of contention since they began.[132] In 2010 Murdoch won a media dispute with then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. A judge ruled the then Prime Minister's media arm Mediaset prevented News Corporation's Italian unit, Sky Italia, from buying advertisements on its television networks.[133] In November 1986, News Corporation purchased a 35% stake in the South China Morning Post group for about US$105 million. At that time, SCMP group was a stock-listed company, and was owned by HSBC, Hutchison Whampoa and Dow Jones & Company.[134] In December 1986, Dow Jones & Company offered News Corporation to sell about 19% of share it owned of SCMP for US$57.2 million,[135] and, by 1987, News Corporation completed the full takeover.[136] In September 1993, News Corporation have agreed to sell a 34.9% share in SCMP to Robert Kuok's Kerry Media for US$349 million.[137] In 1994, News Corporation sold the remaining 15.1% share in SCMP to MUI Group, disposing the Hong Kong newspaper.[138][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In June 1993, News Corporation attempted to acquire a 22% share in TVB, a terrestrial television broadcaster in Hong Kong, for about $237\u00a0million,[139] but Murdoch's company gave up, as the Hong Kong government would not relax the regulation regarding foreign ownership of broadcasting companies.[140] In 1993, News Corporation acquired Star TV (renamed as Star in 2001), a Hong Kong company headed by Richard Li,[140] from Hutchison Whampoa for $1\u00a0billion (Souchou, 2000:28), and subsequently set up offices for it throughout Asia. The deal enabled News International to broadcast from Hong Kong to India, China, Japan and over thirty other countries in Asia, becoming one of the biggest satellite television networks in the east.[5] However, the deal did not work out as Murdoch had planned, because the Chinese government placed restrictions on it that prevented it from reaching most of China. In 2009, News Corporation reorganised Star; a few of these arrangements were that the original company's operations in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East were integrated into Fox International Channels, and Star India was spun-off (but still within News Corporation).[141][142][143] In 1956 Murdoch married Patricia Booker, a former shop assistant and flight attendant from Melbourne; the couple had their only child, Prudence, in 1958.[144][145] They divorced in 1967.[146] In 1967 Murdoch married Anna Maria Torv (T\u00f5rv),[144] a Scottish-born cadet journalist working for his Sydney newspaper The Daily Telegraph.[146] In January 1998, 3 months before the announcement of his separation from Anna, a Roman Catholic, Murdoch was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great (KSG), a papal honour awarded by Pope John Paul II.[147] While Murdoch would often attend Mass with Torv, he never converted to Catholicism.[148][149] Torv and Murdoch had three children: Elisabeth Murdoch (born in Sydney, Australia on 22 August 1968), Lachlan Murdoch (born in London, UK on 8 September 1971), and James Murdoch, (born in London on 13 December 1972).[144][145] Murdoch's companies published two novels by his then wife: Family Business (1988) and Coming to Terms (1991), both considered to be vanity publications.[citation needed] They divorced in June 1999. Anna Murdoch received a settlement of US$1.2\u00a0billion in assets.[150] On 25 June 1999, 17 days after divorcing his second wife, Murdoch, then aged 68, married Chinese-born Wendi Deng.[151] She was 30, a recent Yale School of Management graduate, and a newly appointed vice-president of his STAR TV. Murdoch had two daughters with her: Grace (born 2001) and Chloe (born 2003). Murdoch has six children in all, and is grandfather to thirteen grandchildren.[152] Near the end of his marriage to Wendi, hearsay concerning a possible link with Chinese intelligence became problematic to their relationship.[153][154] On 13 June 2013, a News Corporation spokesperson confirmed that Murdoch filed for divorce from Deng in New York City, U.S.[155][156] According to the spokesman, the marriage had been irretrievably broken for more than six months.[157] Murdoch also ended his long-standing friendship with Tony Blair after suspecting him of having an affair with Deng while they were still married.[158] On 11 January 2016, Murdoch announced his engagement to former model Jerry Hall in a notice in The Times newspaper.[159] On 4 March 2016, Murdoch, a week short of his 85th birthday, and 59-year-old Hall were married in London, at Spencer House; this is Murdoch's fourth marriage.[160] Murdoch has six children.[161] His eldest child, Prudence MacLeod, was appointed on 28 January 2011 to the board of Times Newspapers Ltd, part of News International, which publishes The Times and The Sunday Times.[162] Murdoch's elder son Lachlan, formerly the Deputy Chief Operating Officer at the News Corporation and publisher of the New York Post, was Murdoch's heir apparent before resigning from his executive posts at the global media company at the end of July 2005.[161] Lachlan's departure left James Murdoch, Chief Executive of the satellite television service British Sky Broadcasting since November 2003 as the only Murdoch son still directly involved with the company's operations, though Lachlan has agreed to remain on the News Corporation's board.[163] After graduating from Vassar College[164] and marrying classmate Elkin Kwesi Pianim (the son of Ghanaian financial and political mogul Kwame Pianim) in 1993,[164] Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth and her husband purchased a pair of NBC-affiliate television stations in California, KSBW and KSBY, with a $35\u00a0million loan provided by her father. By quickly re-organising and re-selling them at a $12\u00a0million profit in 1995, Elisabeth emerged as an unexpected rival to her brothers for the eventual leadership of the publishing dynasty. But, after divorcing Pianim in 1998 and quarrelling publicly with her assigned mentor Sam Chisholm at BSkyB, she struck out on her own as a television and film producer in London. She has since enjoyed independent success, in conjunction with her second husband, Matthew Freud, the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, whom she met in 1997 and married in 2001.[164] It is not known how long Murdoch will remain as News Corporation's CEO. For a while the American cable television entrepreneur John Malone was the second-largest voting shareholder in News Corporation after Murdoch himself, potentially undermining the family's control. In 2007, the company announced that it would sell certain assets and give cash to Malone's company in exchange for its stock. In 2007, the company issued Murdoch's older children voting stock.[citation needed] Murdoch has two children with Wendi Deng: Grace (b. New York, 19 November 2001)[23] and Chloe (b. New York, 17 July 2003).[145][146] It was revealed in September 2011 that Tony Blair is Grace's godfather.[165] There is reported to be tension between Murdoch and his oldest children over the terms of a trust holding the family's 28.5% stake in News Corporation, estimated in 2005 to be worth about $6.1 billion. Under the trust, his children by Wendi Deng share in the proceeds of the stock but have no voting privileges or control of the stock. Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would mean, if Murdoch dies while at least one of the children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control). It does not appear that he has any strong legal grounds to contest the present arrangement, and both ex-wife Anna and their three children are said to be strongly resistant to any such change.[166] Murdoch and rival newspaper and publishing magnate Robert Maxwell are thinly fictionalised as \"Keith Townsend\" and \"Richard Armstrong\" in The Fourth Estate by British novelist and former MP Jeffrey Archer.[167] Murdoch has been portrayed by: It was speculated that the character of Elliot Carver, the global media magnate and main villain in the 1997 James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies, is based on Murdoch. The screenwriter of the film, Bruce Feirstein, stated that Carver was actually inspired by British press magnate Robert Maxwell, who was one of Murdoch's rivals.[169] Whenever the Eagles drummer and lead singer Don Henley performs his 1981 hit solo release \"Dirty Laundry\", which directly criticizes what Henley sees as the news industry favoring style and sensationalism over substance and proper journalism, he says that he'd \"like to dedicate this song to Mr. Rupert Murdoch.\"[170] In the 1997 film Fierce Creatures, the head of Octopus Inc.'s Rod McCain (initials R.M.) character is likely modelled after Murdoch.[171] In 1999, the Ted Turner owned TBS channel aired an original sitcom, The Chimp Channel. This featured an all-simian cast and the role of an Australian TV veteran named Harry Waller. The character is described as \"a self-made gazillionaire with business interests in all sorts of fields. He owns newspapers, hotel chains, sports franchises and genetic technologies, as well as everyone's favourite cable TV channel, The Chimp Channel.\" Waller is thought to be a parody of Murdoch, a long-time rival of Turner.[172] In 2004, the movie Outfoxed included many interviews accusing Fox News of pressuring reporters to report only one side of news stories, in order to influence viewers' political opinions.[173] In 2012, the satirical show Hacks, broadcast on the UK's Channel 4, made obvious comparisons with Murdoch using the fictional character \"Stanhope Feast\", portrayed by Michael Kitchen, as well as other central figures in the phone hacking scandal.[174] In the novel Dunbar by Edward St Aubyn the eponymous lead character is at least partly inspired by Murdoch.[175] Murdoch was part of the inspiration for Logan Roy, the protagonist of TV show Succession who is portrayed by Brian Cox[176] Murdoch is played by Malcolm McDowell in the 2019 film Bombshell. According to Forbes' real time list of world's billionaires, Murdoch is the 34th richest person in the US and the 96th richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$13.1\u00a0billion as of February 2017.[177] In 2016, Forbes ranked \"Rupert Murdoch & Family\" as the 35th most powerful person in the world.[178] Later, in 2019, Rupert Murdoch & family were ranked 52nd in the Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires.[179] In 2003 Murdoch bought \"Rosehearty\", an 11 bedroom home on a 5-acre waterfront estate in Centre Island, New York.[180] In August 2013, Terry Flew, Professor of Media and Communications at Queensland University of Technology, wrote an article for the Conversation publication in which he verified a claim by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd that Murdoch owned 70% of Australian newspapers in 2011. Flew's article showed that News Corp Australia owned 23% of the nation's newspapers in 2011, according to the Finkelstein Review of Media and Media Regulation, but, at the time of the article, the corporation's titles accounted for 59% of the sales of all daily newspapers, with weekly sales of 17.3 million copies.[181] In connection with Murdoch's testimony to the Leveson Inquiry \"into the ethics of the British press\", editor of Newsweek International, Tunku Varadarajan, referred to him as \"the man whose name is synonymous with unethical newspapers\".[182] News Corp papers were accused of supporting the campaign of the Australian Liberal government and influencing public opinion during the 2013 federal election. Following the announcement of the Liberal Party victory at the polls, Murdoch tweeted \"Aust. election public sick of public sector workers and phony welfare scroungers sucking life out of economy. Other nations to follow in time.\"[183] In November 2015, former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said that Murdoch \"arguably has had more impact on the wider world than any other living Australian\".[184] In late 2015, The Wall Street Journal journalist John Carreyrou began a series of investigative articles on Theranos, the blood-testing start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes, that questioned its claim to be able to run a wide range of lab tests from a tiny sample of blood from a finger prick.[185][186][187] Holmes had turned to Murdoch, whose media empire includes Carreyrou's employer, The Wall Street Journal, to kill the story. Murdoch, who became the biggest investor in Theranos in 2015 as a result of his $125 million injection, refused the request from Holmes saying that \"he trusted the paper\u2019s editors to handle the matter fairly.\u201d[188][189]",

In 1974, Murdoch moved to New York City, to expand into the U.S. market; however, he retained interests in Australia and Britain. In 1981, Murdoch bought The Times, his first British broadsheet and, in 1985, became a naturalized U.S. citizen, giving up his Australian citizenship, to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television network ownership.[5]\nIn 1986, keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies, Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping, causing bitter industrial disputes. His holding company News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox (1985), HarperCollins (1989),[6] and The Wall Street Journal (2007). Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 and, during the 1990s, expanded into Asian networks and South American television. By 2000, Murdoch's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries, with a net worth of over $5 billion.\nIn July 2011, Murdoch faced allegations that his companies, including the News of the World, owned by News Corporation, had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities, royalty, and public citizens. Murdoch faced police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S.[7][8] On 21 July 2012, Murdoch resigned as a director of News International.[9][10] On 1 July 2015, Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox.[11] However, Murdoch and his family would continue to own both 21st Century Fox until 2019 and News Corp through the Murdoch Family Trust until 20th Century Fox itself was purchased by Disney.[12][13][14][15]\nIn July 2016, after the resignation of Roger Ailes due to accusations of sexual harassment, Murdoch was named the acting CEO of Fox News.[16][17]\nKeith Rupert Murdoch was born on 11 March 1931 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the son of Sir Keith Murdoch (1885\u20131952) and Dame Elisabeth Murdoch (n\u00e9e Greene; 1909\u20132012). He is of English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Murdoch's parents were also born in Melbourne. Keith Murdoch was a war correspondent and later a regional newspaper magnate owning two newspapers in Adelaide, South Australia, and a radio station in a faraway mining town, and chairman of the powerful Herald and Weekly Times group.[5][18]:16 Later in life, Keith Rupert chose to go by his second name, the first name of his maternal grandfather.\nKeith Murdoch the elder asked to meet with his future wife after seeing her debutante photograph in one of his own newspapers and they married in 1928, when she was aged 19 and he was 23 years older.[19] In addition to Rupert, the couple had three daughters: Janet Calvert-Jones, Anne Kantor and Helen Handbury (1929\u20132004).\nMurdoch attended Geelong Grammar School,[20] where he was co-editor of the school's official journal The Corian and editor of the student journal If Revived.[21][22] He took his school's cricket team to the National Junior Finals. He worked part-time at the Melbourne Herald and was groomed by his father to take over the family business.[5][23] Murdoch studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Worcester College, Oxford in England, where he kept a bust of Lenin in his rooms and came to be known as \"Red Rupert\".  He was a member of the Oxford University Labour Party,[18]:34[23] stood for Secretary of the Labour Club[24] and managed Oxford Student Publications Limited, the publishing house of Cherwell.[25] After his father's death from cancer in 1952, his mother Elisabeth did charity work as life governor of the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne and established the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute. At the age of 102 (in 2011), she had 74 descendants.[19] Murdoch completed an MA before working as a sub-editor with the Daily Express for two years.[5]\nFollowing his father's death, when he was 21, Murdoch returned from Oxford to take charge of what was left of the family business.  After liquidation of his father's Herald stake to pay taxes, what was left was News Limited, which had been established in 1923.[18]:16 Rupert Murdoch turned its Adelaide newspaper, The News, its main asset, into a major success.[23] He began to direct his attention to acquisition and expansion, buying the troubled Sunday Times in Perth, Western Australia (1956) and over the next few years acquiring suburban and provincial newspapers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory, including the Sydney afternoon tabloid, The Daily Mirror (1960). The Economist describes Murdoch as \"inventing the modern tabloid\",[26] as he developed a pattern for his newspapers, increasing sports and scandal coverage and adopting eye-catching headlines.[5]\nMurdoch's first foray outside Australia involved the purchase of a controlling interest in the New Zealand daily The Dominion. In January 1964, while touring New Zealand with friends in a rented Morris Minor after sailing across the Tasman, Murdoch read of a takeover bid for the Wellington paper by the British-based Canadian newspaper magnate, Lord Thomson of Fleet. On the spur of the moment, he launched a counter-bid.  A four-way battle for control ensued in which the 32-year-old Murdoch was ultimately successful.[27] Later in 1964, Murdoch launched The Australian, Australia's first national daily newspaper, which was based first in Canberra and later in Sydney.[28] In 1972, Murdoch acquired the Sydney morning tabloid The Daily Telegraph from Australian media mogul Sir Frank Packer, who later regretted selling it to him.[29] In 1984, Murdoch was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for services to publishing.[30]\nIn 1999, Murdoch significantly expanded his music holdings in Australia by acquiring the controlling share in a leading Australian independent label, Michael Gudinski's Mushroom Records; he merged that with Festival Records, and the result was Festival Mushroom Records (FMR). Both Festival and FMR were managed by Murdoch's son James Murdoch for several years.[31]\nMurdoch found a political ally in Sir John McEwen, leader of the Australian Country Party (now known as the National Party of Australia), who was governing in coalition with the larger Menzies-Holt-Gorton Liberal Party. From the very first issue of The Australian Murdoch began taking McEwen's side in every issue that divided the long-serving coalition partners. (The Australian, 15 July 1964, first edition, front page: \"Strain in Cabinet, Liberal-CP row flares.\") It was an issue that threatened to split the coalition government and open the way for the stronger Australian Labor Party to dominate Australian politics. It was the beginning of a long campaign that served McEwen well.[32]\nAfter McEwen and Menzies retired,  Murdoch threw his growing power behind the Australian Labor Party under the leadership of Gough Whitlam and duly saw it elected[33] on a social platform that included universal free health care, free education for all Australians to tertiary level, recognition of the People's Republic of China, and public ownership of Australia's oil, gas and mineral resources. Rupert Murdoch's backing of Whitlam turned out to be brief. Murdoch had already started his short-lived National Star[32] newspaper in America, and was seeking to strengthen his political contacts there.[34]\nAsked about the 2007 Australian federal election at News Corporation's annual general meeting in New York on 19 October 2007, its chairman Rupert Murdoch said, \"I am not commenting on anything to do with Australian politics. I'm sorry. I always get into trouble when I do that.\" Pressed as to whether he believed Prime Minister John Howard should continue as prime minister, he said: \"I have nothing further to say. I'm sorry. Read our editorials in the papers. It'll be the journalists who decide that \u2013 the editors.\"[35] In 2009, in response to accusations by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that News Limited was running vendettas against him and his government, Murdoch opined that Rudd was \"oversensitive\".[36] Murdoch described Howard's successor, Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as \"...more ambitious to lead the world [in tackling climate change] than to lead Australia...\" and criticised Rudd's expansionary fiscal policies in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 as unnecessary.[37] Although News Limited's interests are extensive, also including the Daily Telegraph, the Courier-Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser, it was suggested by the commentator Mungo MacCallum in The Monthly  that \"the anti-Rudd push, if coordinated at all, was almost certainly locally driven\" as opposed to being directed by Murdoch, who also took a different position from local editors on such matters as climate change and stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis.[38]\nMurdoch is a supporter of an Australian republic, having campaigned for one during the 1999 referendum.[39]\nIn 1968, Murdoch entered the British newspaper market with his acquisition of the populist News of the World, followed in 1969 with the purchase of the struggling daily The Sun from IPC.[40] Murdoch turned The Sun into a tabloid format and reduced costs by using the same printing press for both newspapers. On acquiring it, he appointed Albert 'Larry' Lamb as editor and \u2013 Lamb recalled later \u2013 told him: \"I want a tearaway paper with lots of tits in it\". In 1997 The Sun attracted 10 million daily readers.[5] In 1981, Murdoch acquired the struggling Times and Sunday Times from Canadian newspaper publisher Lord Thomson of Fleet.[40] Ownership of The Times came to him through his relationship with Lord Thomson, who had grown tired of losing money on it as a result of an extended period of industrial action that stopped publication.[41] In the light of success and expansion at The Sun the owners believed that Murdoch could turn the papers around. Harold Evans, editor of the Sunday Times from 1967, was switched to the daily Times, though he stayed only a year amid editorial conflict with Murdoch.[42][43]\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, Murdoch's publications were generally supportive of Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[44] At the end of the Thatcher/Major era, Murdoch switched his support to the Labour Party and its leader, Tony Blair. The closeness of his relationship with Blair and their secret meetings to discuss national policies was to become a political issue in Britain.[45] This later changed, with The Sun, in its English editions, publicly renouncing the ruling Labour government and lending its support to David Cameron's Conservative Party, which soon afterwards formed a coalition government. In Scotland, where the Tories had suffered a complete annihilation in 1997, the paper began to endorse the Scottish National Party (though not yet its flagship policy of independence), which soon after came to form the first ever outright majority in the proportionally elected Scottish Parliament. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's official spokesman said in November 2009 that Brown and Murdoch \"were in regular communication\" and that \"there is nothing unusual in the prime minister talking to Rupert Murdoch\".[46]\nIn 1986, Murdoch introduced electronic production processes to his newspapers in Australia, Britain and the United States. The greater degree of automation led to significant reductions in the number of employees involved in the printing process.  In England, the move roused the anger of the print unions, resulting in a long and often violent dispute that played out in Wapping, one of London's docklands areas, where Murdoch had installed the very latest electronic newspaper purpose-built publishing facility in an old warehouse.[47] The bitter Wapping dispute started with the dismissal of 6,000 employees who had gone on strike and resulted in street battles and demonstrations. Many on the political left in Britain alleged the collusion of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government with Murdoch in the Wapping affair, as a way of damaging the British trade union movement.[48][49][50] In 1987, the dismissed workers accepted a settlement of \u00a360 million.[5]\nMurdoch's British-based satellite network, Sky Television, incurred massive losses in its early years of operation. As with many of his other business interests, Sky was heavily subsidised by the profits generated by his other holdings, but convinced rival satellite operator British Satellite Broadcasting to accept a merger on his terms in 1990.[5] The merged company, BSkyB, has dominated the British pay-TV market ever since pursuing direct to home (DTH) satellite broadcasting.[51] By 1996, BSkyB had more than 3.6 million subscribers, triple the number of cable customers in the UK.[5] Murdoch has a seat on the Strategic Advisory Board of Genie Oil and Gas, having jointly investing with Lord Rothschild in a 5.5% stake in the company which conducted shale gas and oil exploration in Colorado, Mongolia, Israel and, controversially, the occupied Golan Heights.[52]\nIn response to print media's decline and the increasing influence of online journalism during the 2000s, Murdoch proclaimed his support of the micropayments model for obtaining revenue from on-line news,[53] although this has been criticised by some.[54]\nIn January 2018, the CMA blocked Murdoch from taking over the remaining 61% of BSkyB he did not already own, over fear of market dominance that could potentialise censorship of the media. His bid for BSkyB was later approved by the CMA as long as he sold Sky News to The Walt Disney Company, who was already set to acquire 21st Century Fox. However, it was Comcast who won control of BSkyB in a blind auction ordered by the CMA. Murdoch ultimately sold his 39% of BSkyB to Comcast.\nNews Corporation has subsidiaries in the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the Channel Islands and the Virgin Islands. From 1986, News Corporation's annual tax bill averaged around seven percent of its profits.[55]\nIn Britain, in the 1980s, Murdoch formed a close alliance with Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and The Sun credited itself with helping her successor John Major to win an unexpected election victory in the 1992 general election, which had been expected to end in a hung parliament or a narrow win for Labour, then led by Neil Kinnock.[56] In the general elections of 1997, 2001 and 2005, Murdoch's papers were either neutral or supported Labour under Tony Blair.[citation needed]\nThe Labour Party, from when Tony Blair became leader in 1994, had moved from the Left to a more centrist position on many economic issues prior to 1997. Murdoch identifies himself as a libertarian, saying \"What does libertarian mean? As much individual responsibility as possible, as little government as possible, as few rules as possible. But I'm not saying it should be taken to the absolute limit.\"[57]\nIn 1998, Murdoch made an attempt to buy the football club Manchester United F.C.,[58] with an offer of \u00a3625\u00a0million, but this failed. It was the largest amount ever offered for a sports club. It was blocked by the United Kingdom's Competition Commission, which stated that the acquisition would have \"hurt competition in the broadcast industry and the quality of British football\".\nIn a speech he delivered in New York in 2005, Murdoch said that Blair described the BBC coverage of the Hurricane Katrina disaster as being full of hatred of America.[59]\nOn 28 June 2006, the BBC reported that Murdoch and News Corporation were considering backing new Conservative leader David Cameron at the next General Election \u2013 still up to four years away.[60] In a later interview in July 2006, when he was asked what he thought of the Conservative leader, Murdoch replied \"Not much\".[61] In a 2009 blog, it was suggested that in the aftermath of the News of the World phone hacking scandal which might yet have Transatlantic implications[62] Murdoch and News Corporation might have decided to back Cameron.[63] Despite this, there had already been a convergence of interests between the two men over the muting of Britain's communications regulator Ofcom.[64]\nIn August 2008, British Conservative leader and future Prime Minister David Cameron accepted free flights to hold private talks and attend private parties with Murdoch on his yacht, the Rosehearty.[65] Cameron declared in the Commons register of interests he accepted a private plane provided by Murdoch's son-in-law, public relations guru Matthew Freud; Cameron did not reveal his talks with Murdoch. The gift of travel in Freud's Gulfstream IV private jet was valued at around \u00a330,000. Other guests attending the \"social events\" included the then EU trade commissioner Lord Mandelson, the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and co-chairman of NBC Universal Ben Silverman.  The Conservatives did not disclose what was discussed.[66]\nIn July 2011, it emerged that Cameron had met key executives of Murdoch's News Corporation a total of 26 times during the 14 months that Cameron had served as Prime Minister up to that point.[67] It was also reported that Murdoch had given Cameron a personal guarantee that there would be no risk attached to hiring Andy Coulson, the former editor of News of the World, as the Conservative Party's communication director in 2007.[68] This was in spite of Coulson having resigned as editor over phone hacking by a reporter. Cameron chose to take Murdoch's advice, despite warnings from Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Lord Ashdown and The Guardian.[69] Coulson resigned his post in 2011 and was later arrested and questioned on allegations of further criminal activity at the News of the World, specifically the News International phone hacking scandal. As a result of the subsequent trial, Coulson was sentenced to 18 months in jail.[70]\nIn June 2016, The Sun supported Vote Leave in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. Murdoch called the Brexit result \"wonderful\", comparing the decision to withdraw from the EU as like \"a prison break\u2026.we're out\".[71]\nIn July 2011, Murdoch, along with his son James, provided testimony before a British parliamentary committee regarding phone hacking. In the UK, his media empire remains under fire, as investigators continue to probe reports of other phone hacking.[72]\nOn 14 July, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons served a summons on Murdoch, his son James, and his former CEO Rebekah Brooks to testify before a committee five days later.[73]  After an initial refusal, the Murdochs confirmed they would attend, after the committee issued them a summons to Parliament.[74] The day before the committee, the website of the News Corporation publication The Sun was hacked, and a false story was posted on the front page claiming that Murdoch had died.[75] Murdoch described the day of the committee \"the most humble day of my life\". He argued that since he ran a global business of 53,000 employees and that News of the World was \"just 1%\" of this, he was not ultimately responsible for what went on at the tabloid. He added that he had not considered resigning,[76] and that he and the other top executives had been completely unaware of the hacking.[77][78]\nOn 15 July, Murdoch attended a private meeting in London with the family of Milly Dowler, where he personally apologized for the hacking of their murdered daughter's voicemail by a company he owns.[79][80] On 16 and 17 July, News International published two full-page apologies in many of Britain's national newspapers. The first apology took the form of a letter, signed by Murdoch, in which he said sorry for the \"serious wrongdoing\" that occurred. The second was titled \"Putting right what's gone wrong\", and gave more detail about the steps News International was taking to address the public's concerns.[80] In the wake of the allegations, Murdoch accepted the resignations of Rebekah Brooks, head of Murdoch's British operations, and Les Hinton, head of Dow Jones who was chairman of Murdoch's British newspaper division when some of the abuses happened. They both deny any knowledge of any wrongdoing under their command.[81]\nOn 27 February 2012, the day after the first issue of The Sun on Sunday was published, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers informed the Leveson Inquiry that police are investigating a \"network of corrupt officials\" as part of their inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption. She said that evidence suggested a \"culture of illegal payments\" at The Sun and that these payments allegedly made by The Sun were authorised at a senior level.[82]\nIn testimony on 25 April, Murdoch did not deny the quote attributed to him by his former editor of The Sunday Times, Harold Evans: \"I give instructions to my editors all round the world, why shouldn't I in London?\"[83][84] On 1 May 2012, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee issued a report stating that Murdoch was \"not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company\".[85][86]\nOn 3 July 2013, the Exaro website and Channel 4 News broke the story of a secret recording. This was recorded by The Sun journalists, and in it Murdoch can be heard telling them that the whole investigation was one big fuss over nothing, and that he, or his successors, would take care of any journalists who went to prison.[87] He said: \"Why are the police behaving in this way? It's the biggest inquiry ever, over next to nothing.\"[88]\nMurdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the San Antonio Express-News. In 1974, Murdoch moved to New York City, to expand into the U.S. market; however, he retained interests in Australia and Britain. Soon afterwards, he founded Star, a supermarket tabloid, and in 1976, he purchased the New York Post.[5] On 4 September 1985, Murdoch became a naturalized citizen to satisfy the legal requirement that only US citizens were permitted to own US television stations. This resulted in Murdoch, in effect, renouncing his Australian citizenship.[89][90]\nIn March 1984, Marvin Davis sold Marc Rich's interest in 20th Century Fox to Murdoch for $250 million due to Marc Rich's trade deals with Iran, which were sanctioned by the United States at the time. Marvin Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase John Kluge's Metromedia television stations.[91] Rupert Murdoch bought the stations by himself, without Marvin Davis, and later bought out Davis's remaining stake in Fox for $325 million.[91] The six television stations owned by Metromedia formed the nucleus of the Fox Broadcasting Company, founded on 9 October 1986, which later had great success with programs including The Simpsons and The X-Files.[5]\nIn 1986 Murdoch bought Misty Mountain, a Wallace Neff designed house on Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills. The house was the former residence of Jules C. Stein. Murdoch sold the house to his son James in 2018.[92]\nIn Australia, during 1987, he bought The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd., the company that his father had once managed.\nRupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox bought out the remaining assets of Four Star Television from Ronald Perelman's Compact Video in 1996.[93] Most of Four Star Television's library of programs are controlled by 20th Century Fox Television today.[94][95][96] After Murdoch's numerous buyouts during the buyout era of the eighties, News Corporation had built up financial debts of $7 billion (much from Sky TV in the UK), despite the many assets that were held by NewsCorp.[5] The high levels of debt caused Murdoch to sell many of the American magazine interests he had acquired in the mid-1980s.\nIn 1993, Murdoch's Fox Network took exclusive coverage of the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL) from CBS and increased programming to seven days a week.[97] In 1995, Fox became the object of scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), when it was alleged that News Ltd.'s Australian base made Murdoch's ownership of Fox illegal. However, the FCC ruled in Murdoch's favour, stating that his ownership of Fox was in the best interests of the public. That same year, Murdoch announced a deal with MCI Communications to develop a major news website and magazine, The Weekly Standard. Also that year, News Corporation launched the Foxtel pay television network in Australia in partnership with Telstra. In 1996, Murdoch decided to enter the cable news market with the Fox News Channel, a 24-hour cable news station. Ratings studies released in 2009 showed that the network was responsible for nine of the top ten programs in the \"Cable News\" category at that time.[98] Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner (founder and former owner of CNN) are long-standing rivals.[99] In late 2003, Murdoch acquired a 34% stake in Hughes Electronics, the operator of the largest American satellite TV system, DirecTV, from General Motors for $6\u00a0billion (USD).[30] His Fox movie studio had global hits with Titanic and Avatar.[100]\nIn 2004, Murdoch announced that he was moving News Corporation headquarters from Adelaide, Australia to the United States. Choosing a US domicile was designed to ensure that American fund managers could purchase shares in the company, since many were deciding not to buy shares in non-US companies.[citation needed]\nOn 20 July 2005, News Corporation bought Intermix Media Inc., which held Myspace, Imagine Games Network and other social networking-themed websites, for US$580\u00a0million, making Murdoch a major player in online media concerns.[101] In June 2011, it sold off Myspace for US$35 million.[102]  On 11 September 2005, News Corporation announced that it would buy IGN Entertainment for $650\u00a0million (USD).[103]\nIn May 2007, Murdoch made a $5\u00a0billion offer to purchase Dow Jones &amp; Company. At the time, the Bancroft family, who had owned Dow Jones &amp; Company for 105 years and controlled 64% of the shares at the time, declined the offer. Later, the Bancroft family confirmed a willingness to consider a sale. Besides Murdoch, the Associated Press reported that supermarket magnate Ron Burkle and Internet entrepreneur Brad Greenspan were among the other interested parties.[104] In 2007, Murdoch acquired Dow Jones &amp; Company,[105][106] which gave him such publications as The Wall Street Journal, Barron's Magazine, the Far Eastern Economic Review (based in Hong Kong) and SmartMoney.[107]\nIn June 2014, Murdoch's 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase.[108] On 5 August 2014 the company announced it had withdrawn its offer for Time Warner, and said it would spend $6 billion buying back its own shares over the following 12 months.[109]\nMcNight (2010) identifies four characteristics of his media operations: free market ideology; unified positions on matters of public policy; global editorial meetings; and opposition to liberal bias in other public media.[110]\nOn 8 May 2006, the Financial Times reported that Murdoch would be hosting a fund-raiser for Senator Hillary Clinton's (D-New York) Senate re-election campaign.[111] In a 2008 interview with Walt Mossberg, Murdoch was asked whether he had \"anything to do with the New York Post's endorsement of Barack Obama in the democratic primaries\". Without hesitating, Murdoch replied, \"Yeah. He is a rock star. It's fantastic. I love what he is saying about education. I don't think he will win Florida [...] but he will win in Ohio and the election. I am anxious to meet him. I want to see if he will walk the walk.\"[112][113] Murdoch is a strong supporter of Israel and its domestic policies.[114]\nIn 2010, News Corporation gave US$1 million to the Republican Governors Association and $1 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[115][116][117] Murdoch also served on the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute.[118] Murdoch is also a supporter of the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act.[119]\nMurdoch advocates more open immigration policies in western nations generally.[120] In the United States, Murdoch and chief executives from several major corporations, including Hewlett-Packard, Boeing and Disney joined New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to form the Partnership for a New American Economy to advocate \"for immigration reform \u2013 including a path to legal status for all illegal aliens now in the United States\".[121] The coalition, reflecting Murdoch and Bloomberg's own views, also advocates significant increases in legal immigration to the United States as a means of boosting America's sluggish economy and lowering unemployment. The Partnership's immigration policy prescriptions are notably similar to those of the Cato Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce \u2014 both of which Murdoch has supported in the past.[122]\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page has similarly advocated for increased legal immigration, in contrast to the staunch anti-immigration stance of Murdoch's British newspaper, The Sun.[123] On 5 September 2010, Murdoch testified before the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Membership on the \"Role of Immigration in Strengthening America's Economy\". In his testimony, Murdoch called for ending mass deportations and endorsed a \"comprehensive immigration reform\" plan that would include a pathway to citizenship for all illegal immigrants.[121]\nIn the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Murdoch was critical of the competence of Mitt Romney's team but was nonetheless strongly supportive of a Republican victory, tweeting: \"Of course I want him [Romney] to win, save us from socialism, etc.\"[124]\nIn May 2013, Murdoch purchased the Moraga Estate, an estate, vineyard and winery in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.[125][126][127]\nIn October 2015, Murdoch stirred controversy when he praised Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and referenced President Barack Obama, tweeting, \"Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide?  And much else.\"[128] After which he apologized, tweeting, \"Apologies! No offence meant. Personally find both men charming.\"[129]\nSince Donald Trump became the US President, Murdoch has shown support for him through the news stories broadcast in his media empire, including on Fox News.[130] In early 2018, Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, had an intimate dinner at Murdoch's Bel Air estate in Los Angeles.[131]\nMurdoch owns controlling interest in Sky Italia, a satellite television provider in Italy.[132] Murdoch's business interests in Italy have been a source of contention since they began.[132] In 2010 Murdoch won a media dispute with then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. A judge ruled the then Prime Minister's media arm Mediaset prevented News Corporation's Italian unit, Sky Italia, from buying advertisements on its television networks.[133]\nIn November 1986, News Corporation purchased a 35% stake in the South China Morning Post group for about US$105 million. At that time, SCMP group was a stock-listed company, and was owned by HSBC, Hutchison Whampoa and Dow Jones &amp; Company.[134] In December 1986, Dow Jones &amp; Company offered News Corporation to sell about 19% of share it owned of SCMP for US$57.2 million,[135] and, by 1987, News Corporation completed the full takeover.[136] In September 1993, News Corporation have agreed to sell a 34.9% share in SCMP to Robert Kuok's Kerry Media for US$349 million.[137] In 1994, News Corporation sold the remaining 15.1% share in SCMP to MUI Group, disposing the Hong Kong newspaper.[138][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nIn June 1993, News Corporation attempted to acquire a 22% share in TVB, a terrestrial television broadcaster in Hong Kong, for about $237\u00a0million,[139] but Murdoch's company gave up, as the Hong Kong government would not relax the regulation regarding foreign ownership of broadcasting companies.[140]\nIn 1993, News Corporation acquired Star TV (renamed as Star in 2001), a Hong Kong company headed by Richard Li,[140] from Hutchison Whampoa for $1\u00a0billion (Souchou, 2000:28), and subsequently set up offices for it throughout Asia. The deal enabled News International to broadcast from Hong Kong to India, China, Japan and over thirty other countries in Asia, becoming one of the biggest satellite television networks in the east.[5] However, the deal did not work out as Murdoch had planned, because the Chinese government placed restrictions on it that prevented it from reaching most of China.\nIn 2009, News Corporation reorganised Star; a few of these arrangements were that the original company's operations in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East were integrated into Fox International Channels, and Star India was spun-off (but still within News Corporation).[141][142][143]\nIn 1956 Murdoch married Patricia Booker, a former shop assistant and flight attendant from Melbourne; the couple had their only child, Prudence, in 1958.[144][145] They divorced in 1967.[146]\nIn 1967 Murdoch married Anna Maria Torv (T\u00f5rv),[144] a Scottish-born cadet journalist working for his Sydney newspaper The Daily Telegraph.[146] In January 1998, 3 months before the announcement of his separation from Anna, a Roman Catholic, Murdoch was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great (KSG), a papal honour awarded by Pope John Paul II.[147] While Murdoch would often attend Mass with Torv, he never converted to Catholicism.[148][149] Torv and Murdoch had three children: Elisabeth Murdoch (born in Sydney, Australia on 22 August 1968), Lachlan Murdoch (born in London, UK on 8 September 1971), and James Murdoch, (born in London on 13 December 1972).[144][145] Murdoch's companies published two novels by his then wife: Family Business (1988) and Coming to Terms (1991), both considered to be vanity publications.[citation needed] They divorced in June 1999. Anna Murdoch received a settlement of US$1.2\u00a0billion in assets.[150]\nOn 25 June 1999, 17 days after divorcing his second wife, Murdoch, then aged 68, married Chinese-born Wendi Deng.[151] She was 30, a recent Yale School of Management graduate, and a newly appointed vice-president of his STAR TV. Murdoch had two daughters with her:  Grace (born 2001) and Chloe (born 2003). Murdoch has six children in all, and is grandfather to thirteen grandchildren.[152] Near the end of his marriage to Wendi, hearsay concerning a possible link with Chinese intelligence became problematic to their relationship.[153][154] On 13 June 2013, a News Corporation spokesperson confirmed that Murdoch filed for divorce from Deng in New York City, U.S.[155][156] According to the spokesman, the marriage had been irretrievably broken for more than six months.[157] Murdoch also ended his long-standing friendship with Tony Blair after suspecting him of having an affair with Deng while they were still married.[158]\nOn 11 January 2016, Murdoch announced his engagement to former model Jerry Hall in a notice in The Times newspaper.[159] On 4 March 2016, Murdoch, a week short of his 85th birthday, and 59-year-old Hall were married in London, at Spencer House; this is Murdoch's fourth marriage.[160]\nMurdoch has six children.[161] His eldest child, Prudence MacLeod, was appointed on 28 January 2011 to the board of Times Newspapers Ltd, part of News International, which publishes The Times and The Sunday Times.[162]  Murdoch's elder son Lachlan, formerly the Deputy Chief Operating Officer at the News Corporation and publisher of the New York Post, was Murdoch's heir apparent before resigning from his executive posts at the global media company at the end of July 2005.[161] Lachlan's departure left James Murdoch, Chief Executive of the satellite television service British Sky Broadcasting since November 2003 as the only Murdoch son still directly involved with the company's operations, though Lachlan has agreed to remain on the News Corporation's board.[163]\nAfter graduating from Vassar College[164] and marrying classmate Elkin Kwesi Pianim (the son of Ghanaian financial and political mogul Kwame Pianim) in 1993,[164] Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth and her husband purchased a pair of NBC-affiliate television stations in California, KSBW and KSBY, with a $35\u00a0million loan provided by her father. By quickly re-organising and re-selling them at a $12\u00a0million profit in 1995, Elisabeth emerged as an unexpected rival to her brothers for the eventual leadership of the publishing dynasty. But, after divorcing Pianim in 1998 and quarrelling publicly with her assigned mentor Sam Chisholm at BSkyB, she struck out on her own as a television and film producer in London. She has since enjoyed independent success, in conjunction with her second husband, Matthew Freud, the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, whom she met in 1997 and married in 2001.[164]\nIt is not known how long Murdoch will remain as News Corporation's CEO. For a while the American cable television entrepreneur John Malone was the second-largest voting shareholder in News Corporation after Murdoch himself, potentially undermining the family's control.  In 2007, the company announced that it would sell certain assets and give cash to Malone's company in exchange for its stock.  In 2007, the company issued Murdoch's older children voting stock.[citation needed]\nMurdoch has two children with Wendi Deng: Grace (b. New York, 19 November 2001)[23] and Chloe (b. New York, 17 July 2003).[145][146] It was revealed in September 2011 that Tony Blair is Grace's godfather.[165] There is reported to be tension between Murdoch and his oldest children over the terms of a trust holding the family's 28.5% stake in News Corporation, estimated in 2005 to be worth about $6.1 billion. Under the trust, his children by Wendi Deng share in the proceeds of the stock but have no voting privileges or control of the stock. Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would mean, if Murdoch dies while at least one of the children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control). It does not appear that he has any strong legal grounds to contest the present arrangement, and both ex-wife Anna and their three children are said to be strongly resistant to any such change.[166]\nMurdoch and rival newspaper and publishing magnate Robert Maxwell are thinly fictionalised as \"Keith Townsend\" and \"Richard Armstrong\" in The Fourth Estate by British novelist and former MP Jeffrey Archer.[167]\nMurdoch has been portrayed by:\nIt was speculated that the character of Elliot Carver, the global media magnate and main villain in the 1997 James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies, is based on Murdoch. The screenwriter of the film, Bruce Feirstein, stated that Carver was actually inspired by British press magnate Robert Maxwell, who was one of Murdoch's rivals.[169]\nWhenever the Eagles drummer and lead singer Don Henley performs his 1981 hit solo release \"Dirty Laundry\", which directly criticizes what Henley sees as the news industry favoring style and sensationalism over substance and proper journalism, he says that he'd \"like to dedicate this song to Mr. Rupert Murdoch.\"[170]\nIn the 1997 film Fierce Creatures, the head of Octopus Inc.'s Rod McCain (initials R.M.) character is likely modelled after Murdoch.[171]\nIn 1999, the Ted Turner owned TBS channel aired an original sitcom, The Chimp Channel. This featured an all-simian cast and the role of an Australian TV veteran named Harry Waller. The character is described as \"a self-made gazillionaire with business interests in all sorts of fields. He owns newspapers, hotel chains, sports franchises and genetic technologies, as well as everyone's favourite cable TV channel, The Chimp Channel.\" Waller is thought to be a parody of Murdoch, a long-time rival of Turner.[172]\nIn 2004, the movie Outfoxed included many interviews accusing Fox News of pressuring reporters to report only one side of news stories, in order to influence viewers' political opinions.[173]\nIn 2012, the satirical show Hacks, broadcast on the UK's Channel 4, made obvious comparisons with Murdoch using the fictional character \"Stanhope Feast\", portrayed by Michael Kitchen, as well as other central figures in the phone hacking scandal.[174]\nIn the novel Dunbar by Edward St Aubyn the eponymous lead character is at least partly inspired by Murdoch.[175]\nMurdoch was part of the inspiration for Logan Roy, the protagonist of TV show Succession who is portrayed by Brian Cox[176]\nMurdoch is played by Malcolm McDowell in the 2019 film Bombshell.\n According to Forbes' real time list of world's billionaires, Murdoch is the 34th richest person in the US and the 96th richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$13.1\u00a0billion as of February 2017.[177] In 2016, Forbes ranked \"Rupert Murdoch &amp; Family\" as the 35th most powerful person in the world.[178] Later, in 2019, Rupert Murdoch &amp; family were ranked 52nd in the Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires.[179]\nIn 2003 Murdoch bought \"Rosehearty\", an 11 bedroom home on a 5-acre waterfront estate in Centre Island, New York.[180]\nIn August 2013, Terry Flew, Professor of Media and Communications at Queensland University of Technology, wrote an article for the Conversation publication in which he verified a claim by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd that Murdoch owned 70% of Australian newspapers in 2011. Flew's article showed that News Corp Australia owned 23% of the nation's newspapers in 2011, according to the Finkelstein Review of Media and Media Regulation, but, at the time of the article, the corporation's titles accounted for 59% of the sales of all daily newspapers, with weekly sales of 17.3 million copies.[181]\nIn connection with Murdoch's testimony to the Leveson Inquiry \"into the ethics of the British press\", editor of Newsweek International, Tunku Varadarajan, referred to him as \"the man whose name is synonymous with unethical newspapers\".[182]\nNews Corp papers were accused of supporting the campaign of the Australian Liberal government and influencing public opinion during the 2013 federal election. Following the announcement of the Liberal Party victory at the polls, Murdoch tweeted \"Aust. election public sick of public sector workers and phony welfare scroungers sucking life out of economy. Other nations to follow in time.\"[183]\nIn November 2015, former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said that Murdoch \"arguably has had more impact on the wider world than any other living Australian\".[184]\nIn late 2015, The Wall Street Journal journalist John Carreyrou began a series of investigative articles on Theranos, the blood-testing start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes, that questioned its claim to be able to run a wide range of lab tests from a tiny sample of blood from a finger prick.[185][186][187] Holmes had turned to Murdoch, whose media empire includes Carreyrou's employer, The Wall Street Journal, to kill the story. Murdoch, who became the biggest investor in Theranos in 2015 as a result of his $125 million injection, refused the request from Holmes saying that \"he trusted the paper\u2019s editors to handle the matter fairly.\u201d[188][189]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJulian Paul Assange (/\u0259\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0n\u0292/;[5] n\u00e9 Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian editor, publisher, and activist who founded WikiLeaks in 2006. WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010),[6][7] the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.[8] In November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange,[9] after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault.[10][11] Assange denied the allegations, and said they were just a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents.[12][13] Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010 but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his \u00a3340,000 bail[14] in June 2012 to seek asylum from Ecuador.[15] In August 2012, Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and possible extradition to the United States.[16] In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship; however it was suspended in April 2019.[1] Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years.[17] During the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton from her private email server when she was Secretary of State.[18] The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts of interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread the stolen documents. Assange consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking \"a neo-McCarthy hysteria\".[19][20][21] On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested.[22] Later that day he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom.[23] On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Times criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act.[24][25] Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019,[26] but in November closed it again, saying that the evidence had weakened over time.[27] Assange is incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh, reportedly in ill health. Assange was born Julian Paul Hawkins on 3 July 1971 in Townsville, Queensland,[28][29][30] to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951),[31] a visual artist,[32]:34 and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder.[33] The couple separated before their son was born.[33] When Julian was a year old, his mother married Brett Assange,[34][35][36] an actor with whom she ran a small theatre company and whom Julian regards as his father (choosing Assange as his surname).[37] Christine had a house in Nelly Bay on Magnetic Island, where they lived from time to time until it was destroyed by fire.[29] Christine and Brett Assange divorced about 1979. Christine then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, and they had a son before breaking up in 1982.[28][38][32]:37\u201338 Julian had a nomadic childhood, living in over 30[39][40] Australian towns and cities by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne.[34][41] Assange attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979\u20131983)[37] and Townsville State High School in Queensland[42] as well as being schooled at home.[35] He studied programming, mathematics and physics at Central Queensland University (1994)[43] and the University of Melbourne (2003\u20132006),[34][44] but did not complete a degree.[45] While in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa. In 1989 they had a son, Daniel, now a software designer.[34][45][46] The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child.[35] At this time, Julian's brown hair turned white.[28] Julian was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood.[47] Julian has other children; in an open letter to then-French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, he stated that his youngest child lives in France with his mother. He also said his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.[48] In 90's Assange visited Russia and developed interest for Russian literature, mentioning Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak and Dostoyevski as his favorite authors, as well Soviet children cartoons.[49] Between 1996 and 1998, he started traveling worldwide, visiting Germany, Poland, Russia and China, meeting \"like-minded young people\", including Chaos Computer Club in Germany.[50] In 1987, aged 16, Assange began hacking under the name Mendax[35][51] (Latin for \"liar\"[52]). He and two others\u2014known as \"Trax\" and \"Prime Suspect\"\u2014formed a hacking group they called \"the International Subversives\".[35] He is thought to have been involved in the WANK (Worms Against Nuclear Killers) hack at NASA in 1989, but he does not acknowledge this.[53][32]:42 In September 1991, Assange was discovered hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel, a Canadian multinational telecommunications corporation.[35] The Australian Federal Police tapped Assange's phone line (he was using a modem), raided his home at the end of October[54] and eventually charged him in 1994 with 31 counts of hacking and related crimes.[35] In December 1996, he pleaded guilty to 24 charges (the others were dropped) and was ordered to pay reparations of A$2,100 and released on a good behaviour bond.[53][55] The perceived absence of malicious or mercenary intent and his disrupted childhood were cited to justify his lenient penalty.[55][56][57][58] In 1993, Assange gave technical advice to the Victoria Police Child Exploitation Unit that assisted in prosecutions.[59][60] In the same year, he was involved in starting one of the first public Internet service providers in Australia, Suburbia Public Access Network.[34][61] He began programming in 1994, authoring or co-authoring the TCP port scanner Strobe (1995),[62][63] patches to the open-source database PostgreSQL (1996),[64][65] the Usenet caching software NNTPCache (1996),[66] the Rubberhose deniable encryption system (1997)[67][68] (which reflected his growing interest in cryptography),[69] and Surfraw, a command-line interface for web-based search engines (2000).[70] During this period, he also moderated the AUCRYPTO forum,[69] ran Best of Security, a website \"giving advice on computer security\" that had 5,000 subscribers in 1996,[32]:45 and contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997), a book about Australian hackers, including the International Subversives.[51][71] In 1998, he co-founded the company Earthmen Technology.[58] Assange stated that he registered the domain leaks.org in 1999, but \"didn't do anything with it\".[58] He did publicise a patent granted to the National Security Agency in August 1999, for voice-data harvesting technology: \"This patent should worry people. Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived in the bowels of an unaccountable foreign spy agency.\"[69] Assange and others established WikiLeaks in 2006. Assange became a member of the organisation's advisory board[72] and described himself as the editor-in-chief.[73] From 2007 to 2010, Assange travelled continuously on WikiLeaks business, visiting Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.[35][40][74][75][76] WikiLeaks published internet censorship lists, leaks,[77] and classified media from anonymous sources, including revelations about drone strikes in Yemen, corruption across the Arab world,[78] extrajudicial executions by Kenyan police,[79] 2008 Tibetan unrest in China,[80] the \"Petrogate\" oil scandal in Peru.[81] WikiLeaks first came to international prominence in 2008,[82] when \"most of the US fourth estate\" filed an amicus curiae brief\u2014through the organisational efforts of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP)\u2014to defend Wikileaks against a DMCA request from the Swiss bank Julius Baer, which had initially been granted.[83] Later documents included leaked emails from the Turkish government published at the height of Erdo\u011fan's post-coup purges in Turkey in December 2016,[84][85] & the collection of more than two million emails from Syrian political figures, government ministries and companies. Assange said of the Syria Files that \"it helps us not merely to criticise one group or another, but to understand their interests, actions and thoughts. It is only through understanding this conflict that we can hope to resolve it.\"[86] By 2015, WikiLeaks had published more than ten million documents and associated analyses, and was described by Assange as \"a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents.\"[87] The material WikiLeaks published between 2006 and 2009 attracted various degrees of international attention,[88] but after it began publishing documents supplied by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley), WikiLeaks became a household name. The Manning material included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010)[6] which showed United States soldiers fatally shooting 18 people from a helicopter in Iraq, including journalists Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh.[7] This material also included the Afghanistan War logs (July 2010),[89] the Iraq War logs (October 2010),[90] and the Guant\u00e1namo files (April 2011).[91] Controversy surrounding WikiLeaks reached its greatest intensity after Assange published a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic cables,[92] known as the \"Cablegate\" files, in November 2010, initially working with established Western media organisations, and later with smaller regional media organisations, while also publishing the cables upon which their reporting was based.[93][94] The files showed United States espionage against United Nations and other world leaders,[95][96][97] revealed tensions between the U.S. and its allies, and exposed corruption in countries throughout the world as documented by U.S. diplomats, helping to spark the Arab Spring.[98][99] The Cablegate and Iraq and Afghan War releases impacted diplomacy and public opinion globally, with responses varying by region.[94] Opinions of Assange at this time were divided. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard described his activities as \"illegal\",[100] but the police said he had not broken Australian law.[101] United States Vice-President Joe Biden and others called him a \"terrorist\".[102][103][104][105][106] Some called for his assassination or execution.[107][108][109][110][111] Support for Assange came from Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva,[112] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa,[113] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,[114][115] British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (then a backbench MP),[116] Spanish Podemos party leader Pablo Iglesias,[117] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay,[118] and Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro.[119] He also garnered support from many leading activists and celebrities, including Tariq Ali,[120] John Perry Barlow,[121] Daniel Ellsberg,[122][123] Mary Kostakidis,[124] John Pilger,[125][126] Ai Weiwei,[127] Michael Moore,[128] Noam Chomsky,[127] Vaughan Smith,[129][130] and Oliver Stone.[131] The year 2010 culminated with the Sam Adams Award, which Assange accepted in October,[132] and a string of distinctions in December\u2014the Le Monde readers' choice award for person of the year,[133][134] the Time readers' choice award for person of the year (he was also a runner-up in Time's overall person of the year award),[135][136] a deal for his autobiography worth at least US$1.3\u00a0million,[137][138][139] and selection by the Italian edition of Rolling Stone as \"rockstar of the year\".[140] In 2011 the Walkley Foundation awarded WikiLeaks the Walkley Award for \"Most outstanding contribution to journalism\".[141] It commended WikiLeaks and Assange for their \"brave, determined and independent stand for freedom of speech and transparency that has empowered people all over the world\". Assange announced that he would run for the Australian Senate in March 2012 under the new WikiLeaks Party,[142][143] and Cypherpunks[144] was published in November. In 2012, Assange hosted a television show on RT, a network funded by the Russian government.[145] In the same year, he analysed the Kissinger cables held at the US National Archives and released them in searchable form.[146] On 15 September 2014, he appeared via remote video link on Kim Dotcom's Moment of Truth town hall meeting held in Auckland.[147] The following February, he won the Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal for Peace with Justice, previously awarded to only three people\u2014Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, and Buddhist spiritual leader Daisaku Ikeda.[148] Two weeks later, he filed for the trademark \"Julian Assange\" in Europe, which was to be used for \"Public speaking services; news reporter services; journalism; publication of texts other than publicity texts; education services; entertainment services.\"[149][150][151] For several years a member of the Australian journalists' union and still an honorary member,[152][153][154] he was awarded the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in June,[155][156] having earlier won the Amnesty International UK Media Award (New Media) in 2009.[157] On 25 November 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and internal documents that provided details on the US military operations in Yemen from 2009 to March 2015.[158][159] In a statement accompanying release of \"Yemen Files\", Assange said about the US involvement in the Yemen war: \"The war in Yemen has produced 3.15\u00a0million internally displaced persons. Although the United States government has provided most of the bombs and is deeply involved in the conduct of the war itself reportage on the war in English is conspicuously rare.\"[159] In April 2017, then CIA director Mike Pompeo, in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, called WikiLeaks \"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia\".[160] Pompeo's accusation followed a series of \"damaging leaks\" of confidential documents, codenamed Vault 7, that included details on the CIA's hacking capabilities.[161] Assange accused the CIA of trying to \"subvert\" his First Amendment rights, saying that \"History shows the danger of allowing the CIA or any intelligence agency, whose very modus operandi includes misdirection and lying, to be the sole arbiter of what is true or what is prudent. Otherwise, every day might see a repeat of the many foolish CIA actions which have led to death, displacement, dictatorship and terrorism.\"[162] In August 2017, in the midst of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, Saudi-owned newspaper Al Arabiya, based in Dubai, said that Assange \"has seven cables about Qatar and only five were published\" after Qatar negotiated with WikiLeaks. Assange responded that \"The Al Arabiya network (HQ in UAE) has been publishing increasingly absurd fabrications as the UAE v Qatar dispute continues.\"[163] A 2017 article in Foreign Policy asserted that in mid 2016 WikiLeaks turned down leaks on the Russian government during the US presidential campaign, stating \"the leak organization ignored damaging information on the Kremlin to focus on Hillary Clinton and election-related hacks\".[164] This was disputed by Wikileaks which said that as far as it could recall the material was \"already public\".[164] The cache had previously been reported on by the BBC and other news outlets to reveal details about Russian military and intelligence involvement in Ukraine.[164] The Foreign Policy article also argued that Assange's position on Russia had evolved. Assange's relationship with Russia \"started as adversarial\" as in he had in October 2010 \"teased a massive dump of documents that would expose wrongdoing in the Kremlin, teaming up with a Russian news site for the rollout\".[164] However, Assange by 2012 \"had his own show on the RT network and in 2016 Assange publicly criticised Novaya Gazeta's coverage of the Panama Papers, suggesting that \"reporters had \"cherry-picked\" the documents to publish for optimal 'Putin bashing, North Korea bashing, sanctions bashing, etc.' while giving Western figures a pass.\"[164] Russian investigative reporter Roman Shleynov said in an interview with the New York Times that it was a surprise for him to hear that \"Mr Assange was repeating the same excuse that our officials, even back in Soviet days, used to say \u2013 that it's all some conspiracy from abroad.\"[164] Assange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: \"I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgment and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ...\u00a0she certainly should not become president of the United States.\"[165] On 25 July, following the Republican National Convention (RNC), during an interview by Amy Goodman, Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. \"Personally, I would prefer neither.\"[166][167][168] WikiLeaks editor, Sarah Harrison, has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.[169] In an Election Day statement, Assange criticised both Clinton and Trump, saying that \"The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers.\"[170] It was revealed in October 2017 that during the 2016 presidential election, Cambridge Analytica funder and substantial Republican donor Rebekah Mercer had proposed creating a searchable database for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain and then forwarded this suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who personally emailed a request to Assange for Clinton's emails.[171][172] Assange responded to the report by saying he denied Nix's request.[173] In a July 2016 interview, Assange implied that Seth Rich, a DNC staffer who was murdered by an unknown assailant earlier that year, was the source behind the DNC emails that WikiLeaks published and that Seth Rich was killed for doing so. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's murder. Assange spoke about sources bringing information to WikiLeaks in the context of Seth Rich, and stated that whistle-blowers are at risk. When an interviewer said that Rich died as a result of \"just a robbery\", Assange said \"No. There's no finding.\"[174][175][176][177] Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election said that Assange \"falsely implied\" that Rich was the source to obscure that Russia was the actual source.[178][179][180] Assange's claims were highlighted by Fox News, The Washington Times and conspiracy website InfoWars.[181][182] According to a study by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, Assange's claims set off a spike in attention to the Seth Rich murder. According to the scholars, Assange's claims lent credibility and visibility to what had at that point been a conspiracy theory in the fringe parts of the Internet.[183] According to the Associated Press, the July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian officers by Special Counsel Robert Mueller undermined the idea that Seth Rich was the source for the DNC emails.[184] Similarly, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Assange knew Seth Rich could not have been his source for the hacked emails, because he continued corresponding with the Russian hackers after Rich's death.[178] On 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seemingly presenting ways to undercut Bernie Sanders and showing apparent favouritism towards Clinton, leading to the resignation of party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.[185][186] The New York Times reported that \"Assange accused Mrs. Clinton of having been among those pushing to indict him\u00a0...\" and that he had timed the release to coincide with the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[187] In an interview with Robert Peston of ITV News, Assange suggested that he saw Hillary Clinton as a personal foe.[166][188] On 4 October 2016, in a WikiLeaks anniversary meeting in Berlin with Assange teleconferencing from his refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, reporters spoke of a supposed promise to reveal further information against Clinton which would bring her candidacy down, calling this information \"The October Surprise\".[189] On 7 October, Assange posted a press release on WikiLeaks exposing a second batch of emails with over 2,000 mails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.[190] Cybersecurity experts and firms attributed the cyberattack to the Russian government.[19] The Central Intelligence Agency together with several other agencies concluded in a leaked secret report, that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the DNC servers, as well as the email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and leaked the stolen information to WikiLeaks to bolster Trump's chances of winning the presidency.[191] As result of the Special Counsel investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections 12 Russian military intelligence agents were indicted on 13 July 2018 for being behind the attack on the DNC mail-server. According to the special counsel's findings this group shared these mails using the pseudonym Guccifer 2.0 with other entities including Wikileaks.[192] The investigation also unearthed direct message exchanges between Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks, in which they coordinated the release of the shared material.[193] In interviews, Assange repeatedly denied that the Russian government was the source of the DNC and Podesta emails,[194][195][21] and accused the Clinton campaign of \"a kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria.\"[20] On the eve of the general presidential election, Assange wrote a press release addressing the criticism around publishing Clinton material on WikiLeaks, saying that WikiLeaks publishes \"material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere,\" that it had never received any information on Trump, Jill Stein, or Gary Johnson's campaign, and that therefore could not publish what it did not have.[196][197] According to Harvard political scientist Matthew Baum and College of the Canyons political scientist Phil Gussin, WikiLeaks strategically released emails related to the Clinton campaign whenever Clinton's lead expanded in the polls.[198] Assange was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Democratic National Committee in April 2018. The lawsuit alleged that WikiLeaks and Russian agents together engaged in a \"brazen attack on American democracy\" about the hacking and publication of its emails in 2016.[199] WikiLeaks sought to dismiss the suit, with its editor in chief Kristinn Hrafnsson calling the case \"a litmus test for press freedoms. The suit claimed that the scandalous emails of powerful political operatives are 'trade secrets' and cannot be published.\"[200] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that the lawsuit \"raises several important press freedom questions\" including the determination of what activities should \"implicate a journalist in a source's illegal behaviour.\"[201] The organisation cited several First Amendment experts who opined that the lawsuit, if successful, might undermine the Supreme Court's precedents that publishers of information \"are not responsible for the illegal acts of their sources,\" such as Bartnicki v. Vopper.[201] The suit was dismissed with prejudice in July 2019. In his judgement, Judge John Koeltl said that the defendants including Assange and Wikileaks \"did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place\" and were therefore within the law in publishing the information. He also said that the DNC case was \"entirely divorced\" from the facts. The suit could not be refiled due to its \"substantive legal defect\".[202] In September 2017, Assange released \"Spy Files Russia,\" revealing \"how a St. Petersburg-based technology company called Peter-Service helped Russian state entities gather detailed data on Russian cellphone users, part of a national system of online surveillance called System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM).\" According to Moscow based journalist Fred Weir, \"experts say it casts a timely spotlight on the vast surveillance operations mounted by Russian security services.\"[203] The unexpected release of the material during the height of the Special Counsel investigation into the relationship between Wikileaks and Russia has drawn some criticism for not revealing anything groundbreaking and therefore looking more like an \"approved release direct from the Russian government\" as an attempt to detract from the investigation.[204][205] After WikiLeaks released the Manning material, United States authorities began investigating WikiLeaks and Assange personally to prosecute them under the Espionage Act of 1917.[206] In November 2010 US Attorney-General Eric Holder said there was \"an active, ongoing criminal investigation\" into WikiLeaks.[207] It emerged from legal documents leaked over the ensuing months that Assange and others were being investigated by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia.[208] In December 2011, prosecutors in the Chelsea Manning case revealed the existence of chat logs between Manning and an alleged WikiLeaks interlocutor they claimed to be Assange;[209][210] he denied this,[211][212][213] dismissing the alleged connection as \"absolute nonsense\".[214] The logs were presented as evidence during Manning's court-martial in June\u2013July 2013.[215] The prosecution argued that they showed WikiLeaks helping Manning reverse-engineer a password, but the evidence that the interlocutor was Assange was circumstantial, and Manning insisted she acted alone.[216] In 2013 US officials said that it was unlikely that the Justice Department would indict Assange for publishing classified documents because \"it would also have to prosecute the New York Times and other news organizations and writers who published classified material, including The Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper\".[217] Assange was being examined separately by \"several government agencies\" in addition to the grand jury, most notably the FBI.[218] Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that Assange was under \"active and ongoing\" investigation at that time.[219] Moreover, some Snowden documents published in 2014 show that the United States government put Assange on the \"2010 Manhunting Timeline\",[220] and in the same period they urged their allies to open criminal investigations into the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks.[221] In the same documents there was a proposal by the National Security Agency (NSA) to designate WikiLeaks as a \"malicious foreign actor\", thus increasing the surveillance against it.[220] In January 2015, WikiLeaks issued a statement saying that three members of the organisation had received notice from Google that Google had complied with a federal warrant by a US District Court to turn over their emails and metadata on 5 April 2012.[222] In July 2015 he called himself a \"wanted journalist\" in Le Monde, in an open letter to the French president.[48] In a December 2015 court submission, the US government confirmed its \"sensitive, ongoing law enforcement proceeding into the Wikileaks matter.\"[223] Under the Obama Administration the Department of Justice did not indict Assange because it was unable to find any evidence that his actions differed from those of a journalist.[224] When Mike Pompeo became CIA director, he and Jeff Sessions \"unleashed an aggressive campaign against Mr. Assange, reversing an Obama-era view of WikiLeaks as a journalistic entity\".[225] In April 2017, US officials were preparing to file formal charges against Assange.[226] In early 2019, individuals began to come forward with news of being questioned about Assange by prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia. Legal scholar Stephen Vladeck stated that the prosecutors, after refusing to unseal the indictment, accelerated the case in 2019 due to the impending statute of limitations on Assange's largest leaks.[227] Witnesses named in the investigation included Jacob Appelbaum, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, David House, Jason Katz and Chelsea Manning, all of whom condemned it as a form of government over-reach.[228] Assange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women.[10] He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was reopened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \"lesser-degree rape\" (Swedish: mindre grov v\u00e5ldt\u00e4kt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain.[11][229] On 20 November 2010, the Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant via Interpol for Assange. On 8 December 2010 Assange gave himself up to British police and attended his first extradition hearing where he was remanded in custody pending another hearing. On 16 December 2010 at the second hearing, he was granted bail by the High Court and released after his supporters paid \u00a3240,000 in cash and sureties. A further hearing on 24 February 2011 ruled that Assange should be extradited to Sweden. This decision was upheld by the High Court on 2 November and by the Supreme Court on 30 May the next year.[230] After previously stating that she could not question a suspect by video link or in the Swedish embassy, prosecutor Marianne Ny wrote to the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2013. Her letter advised that she intended to lift the detention order and withdraw the European arrest warrant as the actions were not proportionate to the costs and seriousness of the crime. In response the CPS tried to dissuade Ny from doing so.[231] In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, Ny changed her mind about interrogating Assange, who had taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[232] These interviews, which began on 14 November 2016, involved the police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials, and were eventually published online.[233] By that time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \"lesser degree rape\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020.[234][235][236][237] On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities suspended their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\", she said.[238][239][240] Following Assange's arrest on 11 April 2019, the case was reopened under prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson. In September 2019, she revealed that she had interviewed seven witnesses, two of whom had not been previously heard, but had yet to determine how to proceed in the case.[241] On 19 November, she announced that she had discontinued her investigation into Assange, stating that after a comprehensive assessment, \"the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment\". She added that although she was confident in the complainant, \"the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed\". Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson welcomed the decision.[242] On 19 June 2012, the Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, announced that Assange had applied for political asylum, that his government was considering the request, and that Assange was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[243][244][245][246] Assange breached bail conditions by staying in the embassy and faced arrest if he left. Assange's supporters, including journalist Jemima Goldsmith, journalist John Pilger, and film-maker Ken Loach, forfeited \u00a3293,500 in bail and sureties.[247][248] Goldsmith said she was surprised at his asylum bid and expected him to face the Swedish allegations.[249] Just before Assange was granted asylum, the UK government wrote to Pati\u00f1o stating that the police were entitled to enter the embassy and arrest Assange under UK law.[250] Pati\u00f1o criticised what he said was an implied threat, stating that \"such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna Convention\". Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service were stationed outside the building from June 2012 to October 2015 to arrest Assange for breaching the bail conditions and to compel him to attend court to face the extradition appeal hearing, should he leave the embassy. The police guard was withdrawn on grounds of cost in October 2015, but the police said they would still deploy \"several overt and covert tactics to arrest him\". The cost of the policing for the period was reported to have been \u00a312.6\u00a0 million.[251] Wikileaks insiders stated that Assange decided to seek asylum because he felt abandoned by the Australian government. The Australian attorney-general at the time, Nicola Roxon, had written a letter to Assange's legal representative, Jennifer Robinson, in which she wrote that Australia would not seek to involve itself in any international exchanges about Assange's future. She also wrote that \"should Mr Assange be convicted of any offence in the United States and a sentence of imprisonment imposed, he may apply for an international prisoner transfer to Australia\". Assange's lawyers described the letter as a \"declaration of abandonment\".[252] Assange and his supporters said he was not concerned about any proceedings in Sweden as such, but believed that his deportation to Sweden could lead to politically motivated deportation to the United States, where he could face severe penalties, up to the death sentence, for his activities related to WikiLeaks.[7] On 16 August 2012, Pati\u00f1o announced that Ecuador was granting Assange political asylum because of the threat represented by the United States secret investigation against him.[253][254][255][256] In its formal statement, Ecuador reasoned that \"as a consequence of Assange's determined defense to freedom of expression and freedom of press\u2026 in any given moment, a situation may come where his life, safety or personal integrity will be in danger\".[257] Latin American states expressed support for Ecuador.[258][259][260][261] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa confirmed on 18 August that Assange could stay at the embassy indefinitely,[262][263][264] and the following day Assange gave his first speech from the balcony.[265][266][267][268] An office converted into a studio apartment, equipped with a bed, telephone, sun lamp, computer, shower, treadmill, and kitchenette, became his home from then until 11 April 2019.[269][270][271] In April 2015, during a video conference to promote the documentary Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, Mar\u00eda Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013 after France, Spain and Italy denied access to their airspace. \"It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences\", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan \"was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result was caused by the United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened.\"[272] In an interview the following month with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, but Assange stated that \"the code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet\u00a0... and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn't think much more of it.\u00a0... We didn't think this was anything more than just distracting.\" Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.[273] On 3 July 2015, Paris newspaper Le Monde published an open letter from Assange to French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in which Assange urged the French government to grant him refugee status.[48] In response to this letter, the French President said: \"France cannot act on his request. The situation of Mr Assange does not present an immediate danger.\"[274] On 4 July 2015, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, head of Assange's legal team, said that Assange had sent the open letter to French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande; but Assange had only expressed his willingness \"to be hosted in France if and only if an initiative was taken by the competent authorities\".[275] In September 2016, Assange said he would agree to US prison in exchange for President Obama granting Chelsea Manning clemency.[276][277] Obama commuted Manning's sentence on 17 January 2017.[277] The next day, at his final presidential news conference, Obama stated, \"I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance.\"[278] The same day, Assange's US-based attorney Barry Pollack asserted (without saying when or where) that Assange \"had called for Chelsea Manning to receive clemency and be released immediately\". Accordingly, Pollack maintained, the commutation\u2014which specified Manning would be freed four months thence\u2014did not meet Assange's conditions.[279] On 17 May 2017, Manning was released from prison.[280] Two days later, Assange emerged on the embassy's balcony and told a crowd that, despite no longer facing a Swedish sex investigation, he would remain inside the embassy to avoid extradition to the United States.[281] On 17 October 2016, WikiLeaks announced that a \"state party\" had severed Assange's Internet connection at the Ecuadorian embassy.[282] The Ecuadorian government stated that it had \"temporarily\" severed Assange's Internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents \"impacting on the US election campaign\".[283] In an interview published on 29 December, Assange said, \"The Internet has been returned.\"[284] On 15 July 2019, CNN obtained documents from an Ecuadorian intelligence official which confirmed that Assange continued to publish Wikileaks material while in the Ecuadorian embassy.[285] The documents also revealed that during the 2016 election in the United States, Assange met with dozens of people within the Ecuadorian embassy. These included employees from RT, for which Assange regularly produced media content, and two German hackers.[285] On 6 June 2017, Assange tweeted his support for NSA leaker Reality Winner,[286] offering a $10,000 reward for information about a reporter for The Intercept who had allegedly helped the US government to identify Winner as the leaker.[287] Assange posted on Twitter: \"Reality Leight [sic] Winner is no Clapper or Petraeus with 'elite immunity'. She's a young woman against the wall for talking to the press.\"[288] Special counsel Robert Mueller's team had been investigating a meeting between former Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort and President Len\u00edn Moreno in Quito in 2017. Moreno talked with Manafort about removing Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and his extradition to the United States.[289] On 28 March 2018, Ecuador cut Assange's Internet connection at its London embassy \"to prevent any potential harm\". Officials said that Assange's recent social media posts denouncing the arrest of Catalonian separatist leader Carles Puigdemont \"put at risk\" Ecuador's relations with European nations. Assange then went silent on social media.[290] In May 2018, a team of Guardian journalists, including Luke Harding, reported that over a five-year span Ecuador had spent at least $5\u00a0million (\u00a33.7m) through a secret intelligence budget to protect Assange at its London embassy, \"employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police\". Visitors included \"individuals linked to the Kremlin\". Ecuadorian officials had reportedly also devised plans to help Assange escape should British authorities use force to enter the embassy and seize him. The Guardian also reported that documents and \"a source who wished to remain anonymous\" had indicated that, by 2014, Assange had \"compromised\" the embassy's communications system and arranged his satellite Internet hookup. \"By penetrating the embassy's firewall\", Assange was allegedly able to \"access and intercept the official and personal communications of staff\". According to The Guardian, this claim was denied by WikiLeaks as an \"anonymous libel aligned with the current UK\u2013US government onslaught against Mr Assange\".[291] On 21 July 2018, Glenn Greenwald reported that the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry was finalising an agreement to release Assange into the custody of the British government.[292] In a press conference the following week, President Len\u00edn Moreno confirmed that he wanted Assange out of the embassy but also \"for his life not to be in danger\".[293] This prompted wide speculation that Moreno aimed to strengthen Ecuador's relations with the United States and assist their extradition efforts.[294] In September 2018, Reuters reported that Ecuador had, in December 2017, granted Assange a \"special designation\" diplomatic post in Russia \u2013 and the cover to leave the embassy and England \u2013 but the British Foreign Office did not recognise diplomatic immunity for Assange and the effort was dropped.[295][296] On 14 October 2018, ITV News reported that Assange's communications had been partially restored following a meeting between two senior UN officials and Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno.[297] On 16 October 2018, congressmen from the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote an open letter to President Moreno which described Assange as a dangerous criminal and stated that progress between the US and Ecuador in the areas of economic co-operation, counternarcotics assistance and the return of a USAID mission to Ecuador depended on Assange being \"handed over to the proper authorities\".[298][299] On 19 October 2018, BBC News reported that Assange was starting legal action against the government of Ecuador, accusing it of violating his \"fundamental rights and freedoms\".[300] Later that month, an Ecuadorian judge ruled against him, saying that a requirement for Assange to pay for his Internet use and clean up after his cat did not violate his right to asylum.[301] In November 2018, Pamela Anderson, a close friend and regular visitor of Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy, gave an interview with 60 Minutes in Australia in which she asked the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to \"defend your friend, and get Julian his passport back, and take him back to Australia and be proud of him\".[302] Morrison rejected the request but his response was described as \"smutty\" and \"lewd\" by Anderson who wrote in an open letter to Morrison that \"[y]ou trivialised and laughed about the suffering of an Australian and his family. You followed it with smutty, unnecessary comments about a woman voicing her political opinion.\" She further advised Morrison that \"[r]ather than making lewd suggestions about me, perhaps you should instead think about what you are going to say to millions of Australians when one of their own is marched in an orange jumpsuit to Guantanamo Bay \u2013 for publishing the truth. You can prevent this.\"[303] In December 2018, President Moreno reached an agreement to have Assange leave the embassy in what he called \"near liberty\". According to a radio interview by Moreno, British sources told him that Assange would be free to live in the United Kingdom without extradition after serving a prison sentence of at most six months. The formal offer was less explicit, simply stating that he would not be extradited to a country with the death penalty. Assange's lawyers declined, citing a need for further protection.[304] In February 2019, the parliament of Geneva passed a motion demanding that the Swiss government extend asylum to Assange. The move was proposed by the Swiss People's Party and supported by the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland.[305] In the same month, it was revealed that Assange was issued with a new Australian passport in September 2018. His previous passport had expired several years ago.[306] In 2015, la Repubblica lodged Freedom of Information requests in Australia, England, the United States and Sweden, seeking information about Assange. It said it was trying to discover whether US authorities told their UK counterparts in 2010 that they\u00a0intended to extradite Assange and also whether the Swedish investigation was used as a way of trying to extradite him to the US. la Repubblica said that its FOI requests had been hindered and delayed in all jurisdictions. However it said it was able to obtain evidence of the UK's role via the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in creating the \"legal and diplomatic quagmire\" which prevented Assange from leaving the Ecuadorian embassy. la Repubblica sued the CPS in 2017 to obtain further information but its case was rejected with the judge saying \"the need\u00a0for the British authorities\u00a0to protect the confidentiality of\u00a0the extradition process\u00a0outweighs\u00a0the public interest of the press to know\".[307] A further appeal was rejected in September 2019.[307][308] The Ecuadorian government of Rafael Correa requested an advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the issue of \"the Institution of Asylum and its Recognition as a Human Right in the Inter-American System,\" and the court issued its advisory opinion in May 2018, upholding the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits signatories of the American Convention on Human Rights from deporting foreign individuals when such a deportation would likely lead to their persecution.[309] According to Doughty Street, the ruling was made shortly after US Vice-President Mike Pence raised the issue of Ecuador's grant of asylum to Assange while on a visit to Ecuador.[310] On 5 February 2016, the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Assange had been subject to arbitrary detention by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison, on conditional bail and in the Ecuadorian embassy. According to the group, Assange should be allowed to walk free and be given compensation.[311][312] The UK and Swedish governments rejected the claim.[313] UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Hammond, said the claim was \"ridiculous\" and that the group was \"made up of lay people\", and called Assange a \"fugitive from justice\" who \"can come out any time he chooses\".[314] UK and Swedish prosecutors called the group's claims irrelevant.[315][316] The UK said it would arrest Assange should he leave the Ecuadorian embassy.[317] Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association, stated that the finding is \"not binding on British law\".[318] Noah Feldman, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, described the UN Working Group's conclusion as astonishing, summarising the conclusion as \"Assange might be charged with a crime in the US. Ecuador thinks charging him with violating national security law would amount to \"political persecution\" or worse. Therefore Sweden must give up on its claims to try him for rape, and Britain must ignore the Swedes' arrest warrant and let him leave the country.\"[319] The Working Group again urged the UK to let Assange leave the Ecuador embassy in London freely. In a statement on 21 December 2018, the organisation asserted that the \"Swedish investigations have been closed for over 18 months now, and the only ground remaining for Mr Assange's continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK, which is, objectively, a minor offence that cannot post-facto justify the more than six years' confinement that he has been subjected to\".[320] In 2019, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights rejected a complaint submitted by Assange, requesting that the Ecuadorian government \"ease the conditions it has imposed on his residence\" at the Ecuadorian embassy in London by monitoring him and restricting his visitors, and not allow him to be extradited to the United States.[321] In 2019, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Prof. Nils Melzer stated that Assange had been subjected to mental torture [322] and demanded his release. He has repeatedly warned about Assange's deteriorating state of health. [323] In April, Ecuador's president Lenin Moreno stated that Assange had violated the terms of his asylum, after photos surfaced on the internet linking Moreno to a corruption scandal.[324][325] WikiLeaks denied that it had acquired any of the published material, and stated that it merely reported on a corruption investigation against Moreno by Ecuador's legislature.[325] WikiLeaks subsequently wrote on Twitter that according to a source within the Ecuadorian government, an agreement had been reached to expel Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy and place him in the custody of UK police.[326][327] The source stated that the expulsion from the embassy would occur in retaliation against WikiLeaks' tweet noting corruption charges against Moreno.[326] Ecuador's Foreign Ministry denied the existence of any planned expulsion.[326][327] On 11 April 2019, the Metropolitan Police were invited into the Ecuadorian embassy and arrested Assange in connection with his failure to surrender to the court in June 2012 for extradition to Sweden.[328] Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno stated that Ecuador withdrew Assange's asylum after he repeatedly violated international conventions regarding domestic interference.[329][330] Moreno referred to Assange as a \"spoiled brat\" and \"miserable hacker\".[331] British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the Ecuadorean president, Lenin Moreno, for co-operation and the British prime minister, Theresa May, said that \"no one is above the law\".[332] The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that Assange is \"not going to be given special treatment\u00a0... It has got nothing to do with [Australia], it is a matter for the US.\"[333] Hours after Assange's arrest, programmer Ola Bini was arrested (but not charged) in Ecuador and interrogated about an alleged plot by unnamed Russian hackers to release compromising information about Moreno in retaliation. Bini had previously met with Assange at the embassy, posted a link to a news article about the plot to Twitter,[334] describing it as a \"witch hunt\", before leaving on a trip to Japan.[335] On the afternoon of the day of his arrest Assange was charged with breaching the Bail Act 1976 and was found guilty after a short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.[336] Judge Michael Snow said Assange was \"a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest\" and he had \"not come close to establishing reasonable excuse\".[337] Assange was remanded to HM Prison Belmarsh, and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court to 50 weeks imprisonment.[23] The judge said he would be released after serving half his sentence, subject to other proceedings and conditioned upon committing no further offences.[338] The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued a statement through the website of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights that the verdict contravened \"principles of necessity and proportionality\" for what it considered a \"minor violation\".[339][340] Assange appealed his sentence, but dropped his appeal in July.[341] On 10 April 2019, WikiLeaks said it had uncovered an extensive surveillance operation against Assange from within the Ecuadorian embassy, asserting that videotapes of Assange taken at the embassy constituted an invasion of privacy. WikiLeaks said that \"material including video, audio, copies of private legal documents and a medical report\" had surfaced in Spain and that unnamed individuals in Madrid had made an extortion attempt.[342][343] On 26 September 2019 the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that the Spanish defence and security company Undercover Global S.L. (UC Global) had spied on Assange for the CIA during his time in the Ecuadorian embassy. UC Global had been contracted to protect the embassy during this time. According to the report UC Global's owner David Morales had provided the CIA with audio and video of meetings Assange held with his lawyers and colleagues. Morales also arranged for the US to have direct access to the stream from video cameras installed in the embassy at the beginning of December 2017. The evidence is part of a secret investigation by Spain's High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, into Morales and his relationship with US intelligence. The investigation was precipitated by a complaint by Assange that accused UC Global of violating his privacy and client-attorney privileges as well as committing misappropriation, bribery and money laundering.[344] Morales was arrested in September on charges involving violations of privacy and client-attorney privileges, as well as misappropriation, bribery, money laundering and criminal possession of weapons. He was released on bail. On 25 September, Spanish Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata sent British authorities a European Investigation Order (EIO) asking for permission to question Assange by videoconference as a witness in the case against Morales. The United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA), which is in charge of processing and responding to EIOs in the UK, provisionally denied De la Mata's request to question Assange, raised a number of objections to the request, and asked for more details. De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK. He said that the crimes were partially committed on Spanish territory because the microphones used to spy on Assange were bought in Spain, and the information obtained was sent and uploaded to servers at UC Global S. L.'s headquarters in Spain.[345] Spanish judicial bodies were upset at having their EIO request denied by UKCA and believed the British justice system is concerned by the effect the Spanish case may have on the process to extradite Assange to the US.[345] In a November 2019 article Stefania Maurizi said she had access to some of the videos, audios and photos from the embassy showing a medical examination of Assange, a meeting between Ecuadorian ambassador Carlos Abad Ortiz and his staff, a meeting between Assange, Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda and lunch between Assange and British rapper M.I.A. Microphones had been placed in the women's toilets to capture meetings between Assange and his lawyers. Phones belonging to some of the embassy's visitors were compromised. Spanish lawyer Aitor Martinez, who is part of Assange's legal team, said videos were taken of meetings between Assange and his legal defence team. Maurizi concluded that, based on statements from former employees of UC Global, internal UC Global emails and the type of information collected, it was clear that the surveillance was conducted on behalf of the US government and the information gathered would be used by the US to assist in its case for extraditing Assange.[346] In late November 2019 Britain agreed to allow Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata to interview Assange at Westminster Magistrates Court via video link on 20 December.[347] According to his lawyer, Assange testified that he was unaware that cameras installed by Undercover Global were also capturing audio and suggested the surveillance likely targeted his legal team.[348] In 2012 and 2013, US officials indicated that Assange was not named in a sealed indictment.[349][350] On 6 March 2018, a federal grand jury for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a sealed indictment against Assange.[351] In November 2018, US prosecutors accidentally revealed that Assange had been indicted under seal in US federal court; the revelation came as a result of an error in a different court filing, unrelated to Assange.[352][353][354][355][356] On 11 April 2019, the day of Assange's arrest in London, the indictment against him was unsealed.[357] He was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion (i.e. hacking into a government computer), a relatively minor crime that carries a maximum 5-year sentence if found guilty.[358][359] The charges stem from the allegation that Assange attempted and failed to crack a password hash so that Chelsea Manning could use a different username to download classified documents and avoid detection.[224] This information had been known since 2011 and was a component of Manning's trial; the indictment did not reveal any new information about Assange.[224][360] On 23 May, Assange was indicted on 17 new charges relating to the Espionage Act of 1917 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.[361] The Espionage Act charges carry a maximum sentence of 170 years in prison.[362] The Obama administration had debated charging Assange under the Espionage Act but decided against it out of fear that it would have a negative effect on investigative journalism and could be unconstitutional. The new charges relate to obtaining and publishing the secret documents. Most of these charges relate to obtaining the secret documents. The three charges related to publication concern documents which revealed the names of sources in dangerous places putting them \"at a grave and imminent risk\" of harm or detention. The New York Times commented that it and other news organisations obtained the same documents as WikiLeaks also without government authorisation. It also said it is not clear how WikiLeaks's publications are legally different from other publications of classified information.[363][364] Most cases brought under the Espionage Act have been against government employees who accessed sensitive information and leaked it to journalists and others.[365] Prosecuting people for acts related to receiving and publishing information has not previously been tested in court.[363] In 1975, the Justice Department decided after consideration not to charge journalist Seymour Hersh for reporting on US surveillance of the Soviet Union.[365] Two lobbyists for a pro-Israel group were charged in 2005 with receiving and sharing classified information about American policy toward Iran. The charges however did not relate to the publication of the documents and the case was dropped by the Justice Department in 2009 prior to judgement.[363][365] Assistant Attorney General John Demers said \"Julian Assange is no journalist\".[366] The US allegation that Assange's publication of these secrets was illegal was deemed controversial by Australia's Seven News as well as CNN.[364][367] The Cato Institute also questioned the US government's position which attempts to position Assange as not a journalist.[368] The Associated Press said Assange's indictment presented media freedom issues, as Assange's solicitation and publication of classified information is a routine job journalists perform.[369] Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, stated that what Assange is accused of doing is factually different from but legally similar to what professional journalists do.[370] Vladeck also said the Espionage Act charges could provide Assange with an argument against extradition under the US-UK treaty as there is an exemption in the treaty for political offences.[364] Forbes magazine stated that the US government created outcry among journalists in its indictment of Assange as the US sought to debate if Assange was a journalist or not.[371] Suzanne Nossel of PEN America said it was immaterial if Assange was a journalist or publisher and pointed instead to first amendment concerns.[372] Several jurists, politicians, associations, academics and campaigners consider that the arrest of Assange constitutes an attack on freedom of the press and international law.[373][374][375] The Reporters Without Borders said Assange's arrest could \"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistle-blowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future.\"[376] Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, wrote that Assange's prosecution for publishing leaked documents is \"a major threat to global media freedom\".[377] Independent United Nations rights experts such as Agnes Callamard said \"the arrest of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange by police in the United Kingdom, after the Ecuadorian Government decided to stop granting him asylum in their London embassy, exposed him to the risk of serious human rights violations, if extradited to the United States\".[378] WikiLeaks was recognised as a \"media organisation\" in 2017 by a UK tribunal, contradicting public assertions to the contrary by some US officials, and possibly supporting Assange's efforts to oppose his extradition to the United States.[379][380][381][382] This is why the Dutch senator Tiny Kox asked the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatovic, whether the arrest of Assange and his possible extradition to the US are in line with the criteria of the European Convention on Human Rights, because Assange can benefit from the protection of the right to freedom of expression and information according the Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.[383] British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed \"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and his extradition to the United States \"should be opposed by the British government\".[376] Eva Joly, magistrate and MEP, said that \"the arrest of Julian Assange is an attack on freedom of expression, international law and right to asylum\".[384] Sevim Dagdelen, a German Bundestag MP who specialises in international law and press law, describes Assange's arrest as \"an attack on independent journalism\" and says that he \"is today seriously endangered\".[385][386] Dick Marty, a former state prosecutor of Ticino and rapporteur on the CIA's secret prisons for the Council of Europe, considers the arrest of whistleblowers \"very shocking\".[387][388] Several well-known Swiss jurists have asked the Federal Council to grant asylum to the founder of Wikileaks because he is threatened with extradition to the United States, which in the past \"silenced whistleblowers\".[389][390] The French Union of Journalists (Syndicat national des journalistes (CGT)\u00a0[fr]), said that \"the dissemination of documents or information of public interest\" could not be considered a legal offence. The union called on Britain \"to refuse the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States and to release him.\"[391] In a letter, several French Union of Journalists (Syndicat national des journalistes (CGT)\u00a0[fr]) and (Syndicat national des journalistes (CFDT)\u00a0[fr]) ask to Emmanuel Macron to enforce Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights . According them, \"Faced with threats to Julian Assange's health and at the risk of seeing him sentenced to life imprisonment, we are saying loud and clear, with the IFJ (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale des journalistes) that \"journalism is not a crime\". They add \"Julian Assange denounced in his publications war crimes condemned by the Geneva Convention. Today, he is the one we would like to imprison, we would like to silence. ..... We consider this case one of the most serious attacks on the freedom of the press, against public freedoms within the EU. The IFJ, the French unions and their Australian counterparts have launched a motion to seize this serious case the UN Human Rights Council and the European Parliament and the Council of Europe\".[392] The yellow vests movement called for Assange's release.[393][394][395] While some US politicians supported the arrest and indictment of Julian Assange, several non-governmental organisations of press freedom condemned it. Mark Warner, vice-chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, welcomed the arrest of Assange, saying that Assange was \"a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security\".[396] The president of the Center for American Progress and former Obama aide Neera Tanden also welcomed the arrest and condemned Assange's leftist supporters, tweeting that \"the Assange cultists are the worst. Assange was the agent of a proto-fascist state, Russia, to undermine democracy. That is fascist behaviour. Anyone on the left should abhor what he did.\"[396] The deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Robert Mahoney, said \"With this prosecution of Julian Assange, the US government could set out broad legal arguments about journalists soliciting information or interacting with sources that could have chilling consequences for investigative reporting and the publication of information of public interest.[375] According Yochai Benkler, a Harvard law professor, the charge sheet contained some \"very dangerous elements that pose significant risk to national security reporting. Sections of the indictment are vastly overbroad and could have a significant chilling effect \u2013 they ought to be rejected.\"[375] Carrie DeCell, staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the charges \"risk having a chill on journalism\".[375] She added,\"Many of the allegations fall absolutely within the first amendment's protections of journalistic activity. That's very troubling to us.\"[375] Ben Wizner from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) speculated that if authorities were to prosecute Assange \"for violating US secrecy laws [it] would set an especially dangerous precedent for US journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\"[397][398][397][398] NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg condemned the indictment.[399][400] Snowden tweeted that \"Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom.\"[401] Daniel Ellsberg said \"Forty-eight years ago, I was the first journalistic source to be indicted. There have been perhaps a dozen since then, nine under President Obama. But Julian Assange is the first journalist to be indicted. If he is extradited to the U.S. and convicted, he will not be the last. The First Amendment is a pillar of our democracy and this is an assault on it. If freedom of speech is violated to this extent, our republic is in danger. Unauthorized disclosures are the lifeblood of the republic.\"[402][403] According to Ron Paul, Assange should receive the same kind of protections as the mainstream media when it comes to releasing information. He said \"In a free society we're supposed to know the truth\u00a0 ... In a society where truth becomes treason, then we're in big trouble. And now, people who are revealing the truth are getting into trouble for it.\" He added \"This is media, isn't it? I mean, why don't we prosecute The New York Times or anybody that releases this?\"[404] In October 2019 former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce called for the Federal Government to take action to stop Assange being extradited from the United Kingdom to the US. Later in October, the cross-party \"Bring Assange Home Parliamentary Working Group\" was established. Its co-chairs are independent MP Andrew Wilkie and North Queensland politician George Christensen. Its members include Greens Richard Di Natale, Adam Bandt and Peter Whish-Wilson, Centre Alliance MPs Rebekha Sharkie and Rex Patrick and independent MP Zali Steggall. The working group will request to visit Assange to determine what support they can provide.[405] Former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa condemned Assange's arrest.[406] Bolivian President Evo Morales also condemned it.[332] Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the indictment.[407][332] In January 2020, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted to oppose Assange\u2019s extradition to the US.[408] Since his arrest at the embassy, Assange has been incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh in London.[23] After examining Assange on 9 May 2019, United Nations special rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Nils Melzer concluded, \"in addition to physical ailments, Mr Assange showed all symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma.\"[409] The British government said it supported the important work of the rapporteur's mandate but disagreed with some of his observations.[410] In a later interview Melzer criticised the \"secretive grand jury indictment in the United States\", the \"abusive manner in which Swedish prosecutors disseminated, re-cycled and perpetuated their 'preliminary investigation' into alleged sexual offences\", the \"termination by Ecuador of Mr Assange's asylum status and citizenship without any form of due process\", and the \"overt bias against Mr Assange being shown by British judges since his arrest\". He said the United States, UK, Sweden and Ecuador were trying to make an example of Assange. He also accused journalists of \"spreading abusive and deliberately distorted narratives\".[411] Shortly after Melzer's visit, Assange was transferred to the prison's health care unit.[412] On 13 September, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that Assange would not be released on 22 September when his prison term ended, because he was a flight risk and his lawyer had not applied for bail.[413] She said when his sentence came to an end, his status would change from a serving prisoner to a person facing extradition.[413] On 1 November 2019, Melzer said Assange's health had continued to deteriorate and his life was now at risk.[414][412] He said that the UK government had not acted on the issue.\"[414][412] In November 2019, an open letter signed by more than 60 doctors said Assange's health was declining to an extent that he could die in prison.[415] On 30 December 2019, Melzer accused the UK government of torturing Julian Assange. He said Assange's \"continued exposure to severe mental and emotional suffering ... clearly amounts to psychological torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"[416][417] On 2 May 2019, the first hearing was held in London into the United States request for Assange's extradition. When asked by the judge whether he consented to the extradition, Assange replied \"I do not wish to surrender myself for extradition for doing journalism that has won many, many awards and protected many people\".[418] On 13 June, British Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he had signed the US extradition order.[419] On 14 June, a procedural hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court decided that a full extradition hearing should begin in February 2020.[420] On 21 October 2019, Assange appeared at the court for a case management hearing. Judge Vanessa Baraitser denied Assange's defence lawyers' request for a three-month delay so that they could gather evidence. Government prosecutor James Lewis QC and the US opposed any delay.[421][422][423] When the judge asked about his understanding of the proceedings Assange replied: \"I don't understand how this is equitable. This superpower had 10 years to prepare for this case and I can't access my writings. It's very difficult where I am to do anything but these people have unlimited resources. They are saying journalists and whistleblowers are enemies of the people. They have unfair advantages dealing with documents. They [know] the interior of my life with my psychologist. They steal my children's DNA. This is not equitable what is happening here\".[421]In January 2020, both sides of the case asked for more time to prepare. The judge reluctantly agreed, scheduling one week of hearings from 24 February and another three weeks from 18 May.[424] Assange describes himself as an advocate of information transparency and market libertarianism.[425] He has written a few short pieces, including \"State and terrorist conspiracies\" (2006),[426] \"Conspiracy as governance\" (2006),[427] \"The hidden curse of Thomas Paine\" (2008),[428] \"What's new about WikiLeaks?\" (2011),[429] and the foreword to Cypherpunks (2012).[144] Cypherpunks is primarily a transcript of the World Tomorrow episode eight two-part interview between Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn, and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmermann. In the foreword, Assange said, \"the Internet, our greatest tool for emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen\".[144] He also contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997),[51] and received a co-writer credit for the Calle 13 song \"Multi_Viral\" (2013). Assange's book, When Google Met WikiLeaks, was published by OR Books on 18 September 2014.[430] The book recounts when Google CEO Eric Schmidt requested a meeting with Assange, while he was on bail in rural Norfolk, UK. Schmidt was accompanied by Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas; Lisa Shields, vice-president of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Scott Malcomson, the communications director for the International Crisis Group. Excerpts were published on the Newsweek website, while Assange participated in a Q&A event that was facilitated by the Reddit website and agreed to an interview with Vogue magazine.[431][432][433] In her 2017 documentary on Assange, Laura Poitras included a scene of him calling the Swedish sexual assault allegations a \"radical feminist conspiracy\"\u2014a comment which she says led them to part ways.[434] In 2011, Assange criticised a Private Eye article for portraying WikiLeaks contributor Israel Shamir as anti-Semitic. According to editor Ian Hislop, Assange called the article \"an obvious attempt to deprive [WikiLeaks] of Jewish support and donations\" and went on to point out that several journalists involved were Jewish. On 1 March 2011, Assange released a statement in which he said, \"Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase. In particular, 'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and word. It is serious and upsetting. We treasure our strong Jewish support and staff, just as we treasure the support from pan-Arab democracy activists and others who share our hope for a just world.\"[435][436]",

WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010),[6][7] the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.[8]\nIn November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange,[9] after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault.[10][11] Assange denied the allegations, and said they were just a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents.[12][13] Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010 but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his \u00a3340,000 bail[14] in June 2012 to seek asylum from Ecuador.[15] In August 2012, Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and possible extradition to the United States.[16] In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship; however it was suspended in April 2019.[1] Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years.[17]\nDuring the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton from her private email server when she was Secretary of State.[18] The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts of interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread the stolen documents. Assange consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking \"a neo-McCarthy hysteria\".[19][20][21]\nOn 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested.[22] Later that day he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom.[23] On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Times criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act.[24][25] Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019,[26] but in November closed it again, saying that the evidence had weakened over time.[27] Assange is incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh, reportedly in ill health.\nAssange was born Julian Paul Hawkins on 3 July 1971 in Townsville, Queensland,[28][29][30] to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951),[31] a visual artist,[32]:34 and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder.[33] The couple separated before their son was born.[33]\nWhen Julian was a year old, his mother married Brett Assange,[34][35][36] an actor with whom she ran a small theatre company and whom Julian regards as his father (choosing Assange as his surname).[37] Christine had a house in Nelly Bay on Magnetic Island, where they lived from time to time until it was destroyed by fire.[29]\nChristine and Brett Assange divorced about 1979. Christine then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, and they had a son before breaking up in 1982.[28][38][32]:37\u201338 Julian had a nomadic childhood, living in over 30[39][40] Australian towns and cities by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne.[34][41]\nAssange attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979\u20131983)[37] and Townsville State High School in Queensland[42] as well as being schooled at home.[35] He studied programming, mathematics and physics at Central Queensland University (1994)[43] and the University of Melbourne (2003\u20132006),[34][44] but did not complete a degree.[45]\nWhile in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa. In 1989 they had a son, Daniel, now a software designer.[34][45][46] The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child.[35] At this time, Julian's brown hair turned white.[28] Julian was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood.[47] Julian has other children; in an open letter to then-French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, he stated that his youngest child lives in France with his mother. He also said his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.[48]\nIn 90's Assange visited Russia and developed interest for Russian literature, mentioning Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak and Dostoyevski as his favorite authors, as well Soviet children cartoons.[49] Between 1996 and 1998, he started traveling worldwide, visiting Germany, Poland, Russia and China, meeting \"like-minded young people\", including Chaos Computer Club in Germany.[50]\nIn 1987, aged 16, Assange began hacking under the name Mendax[35][51] (Latin for \"liar\"[52]). He and two others\u2014known as \"Trax\" and \"Prime Suspect\"\u2014formed a hacking group they called \"the International Subversives\".[35] He is thought to have been involved in the WANK (Worms Against Nuclear Killers) hack at NASA in 1989, but he does not acknowledge this.[53][32]:42\nIn September 1991, Assange was discovered hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel, a Canadian multinational telecommunications corporation.[35] The Australian Federal Police tapped Assange's phone line (he was using a modem), raided his home at the end of October[54] and eventually charged him in 1994 with 31 counts of hacking and related crimes.[35] In December 1996, he pleaded guilty to 24 charges (the others were dropped) and was ordered to pay reparations of A$2,100 and released on a good behaviour bond.[53][55] The perceived absence of malicious or mercenary intent and his disrupted childhood were cited to justify his lenient penalty.[55][56][57][58]\nIn 1993, Assange gave technical advice to the Victoria Police Child Exploitation Unit that assisted in prosecutions.[59][60] In the same year, he was involved in starting one of the first public Internet service providers in Australia, Suburbia Public Access Network.[34][61] He began programming in 1994, authoring or co-authoring the TCP port scanner Strobe (1995),[62][63] patches to the open-source database PostgreSQL (1996),[64][65] the Usenet caching software NNTPCache (1996),[66] the Rubberhose deniable encryption system (1997)[67][68] (which reflected his growing interest in cryptography),[69] and Surfraw, a command-line interface for web-based search engines (2000).[70] During this period, he also moderated the AUCRYPTO forum,[69] ran Best of Security, a website \"giving advice on computer security\" that had 5,000 subscribers in 1996,[32]:45 and contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997), a book about Australian hackers, including the International Subversives.[51][71] In 1998, he co-founded the company Earthmen Technology.[58]\nAssange stated that he registered the domain leaks.org in 1999, but \"didn't do anything with it\".[58] He did publicise a patent granted to the National Security Agency in August 1999, for voice-data harvesting technology: \"This patent should worry people. Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived in the bowels of an unaccountable foreign spy agency.\"[69]\nAssange and others established WikiLeaks in 2006. Assange became a member of the organisation's advisory board[72] and described himself as the editor-in-chief.[73] From 2007 to 2010, Assange travelled continuously on WikiLeaks business, visiting Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.[35][40][74][75][76]\nWikiLeaks published internet censorship lists, leaks,[77] and classified media from anonymous sources, including revelations about drone strikes in Yemen, corruption across the Arab world,[78] extrajudicial executions by Kenyan police,[79] 2008 Tibetan unrest in China,[80] the \"Petrogate\" oil scandal in Peru.[81]\nWikiLeaks first came to international prominence in 2008,[82] when \"most of the US fourth estate\" filed an amicus curiae brief\u2014through the organisational efforts of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP)\u2014to defend Wikileaks against a DMCA request from the Swiss bank Julius Baer, which had initially been granted.[83]\nLater documents included leaked emails from the Turkish government published at the height of Erdo\u011fan's post-coup purges in Turkey in December 2016,[84][85] &amp; the collection of more than two million emails from Syrian political figures, government ministries and companies. Assange said of the Syria Files that \"it helps us not merely to criticise one group or another, but to understand their interests, actions and thoughts. It is only through understanding this conflict that we can hope to resolve it.\"[86]\nBy 2015, WikiLeaks had published more than ten million documents and associated analyses, and was described by Assange as \"a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents.\"[87]\nThe material WikiLeaks published between 2006 and 2009 attracted various degrees of international attention,[88] but after it began publishing documents supplied by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley), WikiLeaks became a household name. The Manning material included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010)[6] which showed United States soldiers fatally shooting 18 people from a helicopter in Iraq, including journalists Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh.[7] This material also included the Afghanistan War logs (July 2010),[89] the Iraq War logs (October 2010),[90] and the Guant\u00e1namo files (April 2011).[91]\nControversy surrounding WikiLeaks reached its greatest intensity after Assange published a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic cables,[92] known as the \"Cablegate\" files, in November 2010, initially working with established Western media organisations, and later with smaller regional media organisations, while also publishing the cables upon which their reporting was based.[93][94] The files showed United States espionage against United Nations and other world leaders,[95][96][97] revealed tensions between the U.S. and its allies, and exposed corruption in countries throughout the world as documented by U.S. diplomats, helping to spark the Arab Spring.[98][99] The Cablegate and Iraq and Afghan War releases impacted diplomacy and public opinion globally, with responses varying by region.[94]\nOpinions of Assange at this time were divided. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard described his activities as \"illegal\",[100] but the police said he had not broken Australian law.[101] United States Vice-President Joe Biden and others called him a \"terrorist\".[102][103][104][105][106] Some called for his assassination or execution.[107][108][109][110][111] Support for Assange came from Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva,[112] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa,[113] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,[114][115] British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (then a backbench MP),[116] Spanish Podemos party leader Pablo Iglesias,[117] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay,[118] and Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro.[119] He also garnered support from many leading activists and celebrities, including Tariq Ali,[120] John Perry Barlow,[121] Daniel Ellsberg,[122][123] Mary Kostakidis,[124] John Pilger,[125][126] Ai Weiwei,[127] Michael Moore,[128] Noam Chomsky,[127] Vaughan Smith,[129][130] and Oliver Stone.[131]\nThe year 2010 culminated with the Sam Adams Award, which Assange accepted in October,[132] and a string of distinctions in December\u2014the Le Monde readers' choice award for person of the year,[133][134] the Time readers' choice award for person of the year (he was also a runner-up in Time's overall person of the year award),[135][136] a deal for his autobiography worth at least US$1.3\u00a0million,[137][138][139] and selection by the Italian edition of Rolling Stone as \"rockstar of the year\".[140]\nIn 2011 the Walkley Foundation awarded WikiLeaks the Walkley Award for \"Most outstanding contribution to journalism\".[141] It commended WikiLeaks and Assange for their \"brave, determined and independent stand for freedom of speech and transparency that has empowered people all over the world\".\nAssange announced that he would run for the Australian Senate in March 2012 under the new WikiLeaks Party,[142][143] and Cypherpunks[144] was published in November. In 2012, Assange hosted a television show on RT, a network funded by the Russian government.[145] In the same year, he analysed the Kissinger cables held at the US National Archives and released them in searchable form.[146] On 15 September 2014, he appeared via remote video link on Kim Dotcom's Moment of Truth town hall meeting held in Auckland.[147]\nThe following February, he won the Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal for Peace with Justice, previously awarded to only three people\u2014Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, and Buddhist spiritual leader Daisaku Ikeda.[148] Two weeks later, he filed for the trademark \"Julian Assange\" in Europe, which was to be used for \"Public speaking services; news reporter services; journalism; publication of texts other than publicity texts; education services; entertainment services.\"[149][150][151] For several years a member of the Australian journalists' union and still an honorary member,[152][153][154] he was awarded the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in June,[155][156] having earlier won the Amnesty International UK Media Award (New Media) in 2009.[157]\nOn 25 November 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and internal documents that provided details on the US military operations in Yemen from 2009 to March 2015.[158][159] In a statement accompanying release of \"Yemen Files\", Assange said about the US involvement in the Yemen war: \"The war in Yemen has produced 3.15\u00a0million internally displaced persons. Although the United States government has provided most of the bombs and is deeply involved in the conduct of the war itself reportage on the war in English is conspicuously rare.\"[159]\nIn April 2017, then CIA director Mike Pompeo, in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, called WikiLeaks \"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia\".[160] Pompeo's accusation followed a series of \"damaging leaks\" of confidential documents, codenamed Vault 7, that included details on the CIA's hacking capabilities.[161] Assange accused the CIA of trying to \"subvert\" his First Amendment rights, saying that \"History shows the danger of allowing the CIA or any intelligence agency, whose very modus operandi includes misdirection and lying, to be the sole arbiter of what is true or what is prudent. Otherwise, every day might see a repeat of the many foolish CIA actions which have led to death, displacement, dictatorship and terrorism.\"[162]\nIn August 2017, in the midst of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, Saudi-owned newspaper Al Arabiya, based in Dubai, said that Assange \"has seven cables about Qatar and only five were published\" after Qatar negotiated with WikiLeaks. Assange responded that \"The Al Arabiya network (HQ in UAE) has been publishing increasingly absurd fabrications as the UAE v Qatar dispute continues.\"[163]\nA 2017 article in Foreign Policy asserted that in mid 2016 WikiLeaks turned down leaks on the Russian government during the US presidential campaign, stating \"the leak organization ignored damaging information on the Kremlin to focus on Hillary Clinton and election-related hacks\".[164] This was disputed by Wikileaks which said that as far as it could recall the material was \"already public\".[164] The cache had previously been reported on by the BBC and other news outlets to reveal details about Russian military and intelligence involvement in Ukraine.[164] The Foreign Policy article also argued that Assange's position on Russia had evolved. Assange's relationship with Russia \"started as adversarial\" as in he had in October 2010 \"teased a massive dump of documents that would expose wrongdoing in the Kremlin, teaming up with a Russian news site for the rollout\".[164] However, Assange by 2012 \"had his own show on the RT network and in 2016 Assange publicly criticised Novaya Gazeta's coverage of the Panama Papers, suggesting that \"reporters had \"cherry-picked\" the documents to publish for optimal 'Putin bashing, North Korea bashing, sanctions bashing, etc.' while giving Western figures a pass.\"[164] Russian investigative reporter Roman Shleynov said in an interview with the New York Times that it was a surprise for him to hear that \"Mr Assange was repeating the same excuse that our officials, even back in Soviet days, used to say \u2013 that it's all some conspiracy from abroad.\"[164]\nAssange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: \"I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgment and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ...\u00a0she certainly should not become president of the United States.\"[165] On 25 July, following the Republican National Convention (RNC), during an interview by Amy Goodman, Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. \"Personally, I would prefer neither.\"[166][167][168] WikiLeaks editor, Sarah Harrison, has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.[169] In an Election Day statement, Assange criticised both Clinton and Trump, saying that \"The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers.\"[170]\nIt was revealed in October 2017 that during the 2016 presidential election, Cambridge Analytica funder and substantial Republican donor Rebekah Mercer had proposed creating a searchable database for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain and then forwarded this suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who personally emailed a request to Assange for Clinton's emails.[171][172] Assange responded to the report by saying he denied Nix's request.[173]\nIn a July 2016 interview, Assange implied that Seth Rich, a DNC staffer who was murdered by an unknown assailant earlier that year, was the source behind the DNC emails that WikiLeaks published and that Seth Rich was killed for doing so. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's murder. Assange spoke about sources bringing information to WikiLeaks in the context of Seth Rich, and stated that whistle-blowers are at risk. When an interviewer said that Rich died as a result of \"just a robbery\", Assange said \"No. There's no finding.\"[174][175][176][177] Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election said that Assange \"falsely implied\" that Rich was the source to obscure that Russia was the actual source.[178][179][180]\nAssange's claims were highlighted by Fox News, The Washington Times and conspiracy website InfoWars.[181][182] According to a study by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, Assange's claims set off a spike in attention to the Seth Rich murder. According to the scholars, Assange's claims lent credibility and visibility to what had at that point been a conspiracy theory in the fringe parts of the Internet.[183] According to the Associated Press, the July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian officers by Special Counsel Robert Mueller undermined the idea that Seth Rich was the source for the DNC emails.[184] Similarly, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Assange knew Seth Rich could not have been his source for the hacked emails, because he continued corresponding with the Russian hackers after Rich's death.[178]\nOn 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seemingly presenting ways to undercut Bernie Sanders and showing apparent favouritism towards Clinton, leading to the resignation of party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.[185][186] The New York Times reported that \"Assange accused Mrs. Clinton of having been among those pushing to indict him\u00a0...\" and that he had timed the release to coincide with the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[187] In an interview with Robert Peston of ITV News, Assange suggested that he saw Hillary Clinton as a personal foe.[166][188] On 4 October 2016, in a WikiLeaks anniversary meeting in Berlin with Assange teleconferencing from his refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, reporters spoke of a supposed promise to reveal further information against Clinton which would bring her candidacy down, calling this information \"The October Surprise\".[189] On 7 October, Assange posted a press release on WikiLeaks exposing a second batch of emails with over 2,000 mails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.[190]\nCybersecurity experts and firms attributed the cyberattack to the Russian government.[19] The Central Intelligence Agency together with several other agencies concluded in a leaked secret report, that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the DNC servers, as well as the email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and leaked the stolen information to WikiLeaks to bolster Trump's chances of winning the presidency.[191] As result of the Special Counsel investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections 12 Russian military intelligence agents were indicted on 13 July 2018 for being behind the attack on the DNC mail-server. According to the special counsel's findings this group shared these mails using the pseudonym Guccifer 2.0 with other entities including Wikileaks.[192] The investigation also unearthed direct message exchanges between Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks, in which they coordinated the release of the shared material.[193] In interviews, Assange repeatedly denied that the Russian government was the source of the DNC and Podesta emails,[194][195][21] and accused the Clinton campaign of \"a kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria.\"[20] On the eve of the general presidential election, Assange wrote a press release addressing the criticism around publishing Clinton material on WikiLeaks, saying that WikiLeaks publishes \"material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere,\" that it had never received any information on Trump, Jill Stein, or Gary Johnson's campaign, and that therefore could not publish what it did not have.[196][197]\nAccording to Harvard political scientist Matthew Baum and College of the Canyons political scientist Phil Gussin, WikiLeaks strategically released emails related to the Clinton campaign whenever Clinton's lead expanded in the polls.[198]\nAssange was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Democratic National Committee in April 2018. The lawsuit alleged that WikiLeaks and Russian agents together engaged in a \"brazen attack on American democracy\" about the hacking and publication of its emails in 2016.[199] WikiLeaks sought to dismiss the suit, with its editor in chief Kristinn Hrafnsson calling the case \"a litmus test for press freedoms. The suit claimed that the scandalous emails of powerful political operatives are 'trade secrets' and cannot be published.\"[200]\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that the lawsuit \"raises several important press freedom questions\" including the determination of what activities should \"implicate a journalist in a source's illegal behaviour.\"[201] The organisation cited several First Amendment experts who opined that the lawsuit, if successful, might undermine the Supreme Court's precedents that publishers of information \"are not responsible for the illegal acts of their sources,\" such as Bartnicki v. Vopper.[201]\nThe suit was dismissed with prejudice in July 2019. In his judgement, Judge John Koeltl said that the defendants including Assange and Wikileaks \"did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place\" and were therefore within the law in publishing the information. He also said that the DNC case was \"entirely divorced\" from the facts. The suit could not be refiled due to its \"substantive legal defect\".[202]\nIn September 2017, Assange released \"Spy Files Russia,\" revealing \"how a St. Petersburg-based technology company called Peter-Service helped Russian state entities gather detailed data on Russian cellphone users, part of a national system of online surveillance called System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM).\" According to Moscow based journalist Fred Weir, \"experts say it casts a timely spotlight on the vast surveillance operations mounted by Russian security services.\"[203] The unexpected release of the material during the height of the Special Counsel investigation into the relationship between Wikileaks and Russia has drawn some criticism for not revealing anything groundbreaking and therefore looking more like an \"approved release direct from the Russian government\" as an attempt to detract from the investigation.[204][205]\nAfter WikiLeaks released the Manning material, United States authorities began investigating WikiLeaks and Assange personally to prosecute them under the Espionage Act of 1917.[206] In November 2010 US Attorney-General Eric Holder said there was \"an active, ongoing criminal investigation\" into WikiLeaks.[207] It emerged from legal documents leaked over the ensuing months that Assange and others were being investigated by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia.[208]\nIn December 2011, prosecutors in the Chelsea Manning case revealed the existence of chat logs between Manning and an alleged WikiLeaks interlocutor they claimed to be Assange;[209][210] he denied this,[211][212][213] dismissing the alleged connection as \"absolute nonsense\".[214] The logs were presented as evidence during Manning's court-martial in June\u2013July 2013.[215] The prosecution argued that they showed WikiLeaks helping Manning reverse-engineer a password, but the evidence that the interlocutor was Assange was circumstantial, and Manning insisted she acted alone.[216]\nIn 2013 US officials said that it was unlikely that the Justice Department would indict Assange for publishing classified documents because \"it would also have to prosecute the New York Times and other news organizations and writers who published classified material, including The Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper\".[217]\nAssange was being examined separately by \"several government agencies\" in addition to the grand jury, most notably the FBI.[218] Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that Assange was under \"active and ongoing\" investigation at that time.[219]\nMoreover, some Snowden documents published in 2014 show that the United States government put Assange on the \"2010 Manhunting Timeline\",[220] and in the same period they urged their allies to open criminal investigations into the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks.[221] In the same documents there was a proposal by the National Security Agency (NSA) to designate WikiLeaks as a \"malicious foreign actor\", thus increasing the surveillance against it.[220]\nIn January 2015, WikiLeaks issued a statement saying that three members of the organisation had received notice from Google that Google had complied with a federal warrant by a US District Court to turn over their emails and metadata on 5 April 2012.[222] In July 2015 he called himself a \"wanted journalist\" in Le Monde, in an open letter to the French president.[48] In a December 2015 court submission, the US government confirmed its \"sensitive, ongoing law enforcement proceeding into the Wikileaks matter.\"[223]\nUnder the Obama Administration the Department of Justice did not indict Assange because it was unable to find any evidence that his actions differed from those of a journalist.[224]\nWhen Mike Pompeo became CIA director, he and Jeff Sessions \"unleashed an aggressive campaign against Mr. Assange, reversing an Obama-era view of WikiLeaks as a journalistic entity\".[225]\nIn April 2017, US officials were preparing to file formal charges against Assange.[226] \nIn early 2019, individuals began to come forward with news of being questioned about Assange by prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia. Legal scholar Stephen Vladeck stated that the prosecutors, after refusing to unseal the indictment, accelerated the case in 2019 due to the impending statute of limitations on Assange's largest leaks.[227] Witnesses named in the investigation included Jacob Appelbaum, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, David House, Jason Katz and Chelsea Manning, all of whom condemned it as a form of government over-reach.[228]\nAssange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women.[10] He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was reopened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \"lesser-degree rape\" (Swedish: mindre grov v\u00e5ldt\u00e4kt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain.[11][229]\nOn 20 November 2010, the Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant via Interpol for Assange. On 8 December 2010 Assange gave himself up to British police and attended his first extradition hearing where he was remanded in custody pending another hearing. On 16 December 2010 at the second hearing, he was granted bail by the High Court and released after his supporters paid \u00a3240,000 in cash and sureties. A further hearing on 24 February 2011 ruled that Assange should be extradited to Sweden. This decision was upheld by the High Court on 2 November and by the Supreme Court on 30 May the next year.[230]\nAfter previously stating that she could not question a suspect by video link or in the Swedish embassy, prosecutor Marianne Ny wrote to the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2013. Her letter advised that she intended to lift the detention order and withdraw the European arrest warrant as the actions were not proportionate to the costs and seriousness of the crime. In response the CPS tried to dissuade Ny from doing so.[231]\nIn March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, Ny changed her mind about interrogating Assange, who had taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[232] These interviews, which began on 14 November 2016, involved the police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials, and were eventually published online.[233] By that time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \"lesser degree rape\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020.[234][235][236][237]\nOn 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities suspended their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\", she said.[238][239][240]\nFollowing Assange's arrest on 11 April 2019, the case was reopened under prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson. In September 2019, she revealed that she had interviewed seven witnesses, two of whom had not been previously heard, but had yet to determine how to proceed in the case.[241] On 19 November, she announced that she had discontinued her investigation into Assange, stating that after a comprehensive assessment, \"the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment\". She added that although she was confident in the complainant, \"the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed\". Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson welcomed the decision.[242]\nOn 19 June 2012, the Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, announced that Assange had applied for political asylum, that his government was considering the request, and that Assange was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[243][244][245][246]\nAssange breached bail conditions by staying in the embassy and faced arrest if he left. Assange's supporters, including journalist Jemima Goldsmith, journalist John Pilger, and film-maker Ken Loach, forfeited \u00a3293,500 in bail and sureties.[247][248] Goldsmith said she was surprised at his asylum bid and expected him to face the Swedish allegations.[249]\nJust before Assange was granted asylum, the UK government wrote to Pati\u00f1o stating that the police were entitled to enter the embassy and arrest Assange under UK law.[250] Pati\u00f1o criticised what he said was an implied threat, stating that \"such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna Convention\". Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service were stationed outside the building from June 2012 to October 2015 to arrest Assange for breaching the bail conditions and to compel him to attend court to face the extradition appeal hearing, should he leave the embassy. The police guard was withdrawn on grounds of cost in October 2015, but the police said they would still deploy \"several overt and covert tactics to arrest him\". The cost of the policing for the period was reported to have been \u00a312.6\u00a0 million.[251]\nWikileaks insiders stated that Assange decided to seek asylum because he felt abandoned by the Australian government. The Australian attorney-general at the time, Nicola Roxon, had written a letter to Assange's legal representative, Jennifer Robinson, in which she wrote that Australia would not seek to involve itself in any international exchanges about Assange's future. She also wrote that \"should Mr Assange be convicted of any offence in the United States and a sentence of imprisonment imposed, he may apply for an international prisoner transfer to Australia\". Assange's lawyers described the letter as a \"declaration of abandonment\".[252]\nAssange and his supporters said he was not concerned about any proceedings in Sweden as such, but believed that his deportation to Sweden could lead to politically motivated deportation to the United States, where he could face severe penalties, up to the death sentence, for his activities related to WikiLeaks.[7]\nOn 16 August 2012, Pati\u00f1o announced that Ecuador was granting Assange political asylum because of the threat represented by the United States secret investigation against him.[253][254][255][256] In its formal statement, Ecuador reasoned that \"as a consequence of Assange's determined defense to freedom of expression and freedom of press\u2026 in any given moment, a situation may come where his life, safety or personal integrity will be in danger\".[257] Latin American states expressed support for Ecuador.[258][259][260][261] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa confirmed on 18 August that Assange could stay at the embassy indefinitely,[262][263][264] and the following day Assange gave his first speech from the balcony.[265][266][267][268] An office converted into a studio apartment, equipped with a bed, telephone, sun lamp, computer, shower, treadmill, and kitchenette, became his home from then until 11 April 2019.[269][270][271]\nIn April 2015, during a video conference to promote the documentary Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, Mar\u00eda Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013 after France, Spain and Italy denied access to their airspace. \"It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences\", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan \"was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result was caused by the United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened.\"[272]\nIn an interview the following month with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, but Assange stated that \"the code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet\u00a0... and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn't think much more of it.\u00a0... We didn't think this was anything more than just distracting.\" Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.[273]\nOn 3 July 2015, Paris newspaper Le Monde published an open letter from Assange to French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in which Assange urged the French government to grant him refugee status.[48] In response to this letter, the French President said: \"France cannot act on his request. The situation of Mr Assange does not present an immediate danger.\"[274] On 4 July 2015, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, head of Assange's legal team, said that Assange had sent the open letter to French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande; but Assange had only expressed his willingness \"to be hosted in France if and only if an initiative was taken by the competent authorities\".[275]\nIn September 2016, Assange said he would agree to US prison in exchange for President Obama granting Chelsea Manning clemency.[276][277] Obama commuted Manning's sentence on 17 January 2017.[277] The next day, at his final presidential news conference, Obama stated, \"I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance.\"[278] The same day, Assange's US-based attorney Barry Pollack asserted (without saying when or where) that Assange \"had called for Chelsea Manning to receive clemency and be released immediately\". Accordingly, Pollack maintained, the commutation\u2014which specified Manning would be freed four months thence\u2014did not meet Assange's conditions.[279] On 17 May 2017, Manning was released from prison.[280] Two days later, Assange emerged on the embassy's balcony and told a crowd that, despite no longer facing a Swedish sex investigation, he would remain inside the embassy to avoid extradition to the United States.[281]\nOn 17 October 2016, WikiLeaks announced that a \"state party\" had severed Assange's Internet connection at the Ecuadorian embassy.[282] The Ecuadorian government stated that it had \"temporarily\" severed Assange's Internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents \"impacting on the US election campaign\".[283] In an interview published on 29 December, Assange said, \"The Internet has been returned.\"[284]\nOn 15 July 2019, CNN obtained documents from an Ecuadorian intelligence official which confirmed that Assange continued to publish Wikileaks material while in the Ecuadorian embassy.[285] The documents also revealed that during the 2016 election in the United States, Assange met with dozens of people within the Ecuadorian embassy. These included employees from RT, for which Assange regularly produced media content, and two German hackers.[285]\nOn 6 June 2017, Assange tweeted his support for NSA leaker Reality Winner,[286] offering a $10,000 reward for information about a reporter for The Intercept who had allegedly helped the US government to identify Winner as the leaker.[287] Assange posted on Twitter: \"Reality Leight [sic] Winner is no Clapper or Petraeus with 'elite immunity'. She's a young woman against the wall for talking to the press.\"[288]\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's team had been investigating a meeting between former Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort and President Len\u00edn Moreno in Quito in 2017. Moreno talked with Manafort about removing Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and his extradition to the United States.[289]\nOn 28 March 2018, Ecuador cut Assange's Internet connection at its London embassy \"to prevent any potential harm\". Officials said that Assange's recent social media posts denouncing the arrest of Catalonian separatist leader Carles Puigdemont \"put at risk\" Ecuador's relations with European nations. Assange then went silent on social media.[290]\nIn May 2018, a team of Guardian journalists, including Luke Harding, reported that over a five-year span Ecuador had spent at least $5\u00a0million (\u00a33.7m) through a secret intelligence budget to protect Assange at its London embassy, \"employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police\". Visitors included \"individuals linked to the Kremlin\". Ecuadorian officials had reportedly also devised plans to help Assange escape should British authorities use force to enter the embassy and seize him. The Guardian also reported that documents and \"a source who wished to remain anonymous\" had indicated that, by 2014, Assange had \"compromised\" the embassy's communications system and arranged his satellite Internet hookup. \"By penetrating the embassy's firewall\", Assange was allegedly able to \"access and intercept the official and personal communications of staff\". According to The Guardian, this claim was denied by WikiLeaks as an \"anonymous libel aligned with the current UK\u2013US government onslaught against Mr Assange\".[291]\nOn 21 July 2018, Glenn Greenwald reported that the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry was finalising an agreement to release Assange into the custody of the British government.[292] In a press conference the following week, President Len\u00edn Moreno confirmed that he wanted Assange out of the embassy but also \"for his life not to be in danger\".[293] This prompted wide speculation that Moreno aimed to strengthen Ecuador's relations with the United States and assist their extradition efforts.[294]\nIn September 2018, Reuters reported that Ecuador had, in December 2017, granted Assange a \"special designation\" diplomatic post in Russia \u2013 and the cover to leave the embassy and England \u2013 but the British Foreign Office did not recognise diplomatic immunity for Assange and the effort was dropped.[295][296]\nOn 14 October 2018, ITV News reported that Assange's communications had been partially restored following a meeting between two senior UN officials and Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno.[297]\nOn 16 October 2018, congressmen from the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote an open letter to President Moreno which described Assange as a dangerous criminal and stated that progress between the US and Ecuador in the areas of economic co-operation, counternarcotics assistance and the return of a USAID mission to Ecuador depended on Assange being \"handed over to the proper authorities\".[298][299]\nOn 19 October 2018, BBC News reported that Assange was starting legal action against the government of Ecuador, accusing it of violating his \"fundamental rights and freedoms\".[300] Later that month, an Ecuadorian judge ruled against him, saying that a requirement for Assange to pay for his Internet use and clean up after his cat did not violate his right to asylum.[301]\nIn November 2018, Pamela Anderson, a close friend and regular visitor of Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy, gave an interview with 60 Minutes in Australia in which she asked the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to \"defend your friend, and get Julian his passport back, and take him back to Australia and be proud of him\".[302] Morrison rejected the request but his response was described as \"smutty\" and \"lewd\" by Anderson who wrote in an open letter to Morrison that \"[y]ou trivialised and laughed about the suffering of an Australian and his family. You followed it with smutty, unnecessary comments about a woman voicing her political opinion.\" She further advised Morrison that \"[r]ather than making lewd suggestions about me, perhaps you should instead think about what you are going to say to millions of Australians when one of their own is marched in an orange jumpsuit to Guantanamo Bay \u2013 for publishing the truth. You can prevent this.\"[303]\nIn December 2018, President Moreno reached an agreement to have Assange leave the embassy in what he called \"near liberty\". According to a radio interview by Moreno, British sources told him that Assange would be free to live in the United Kingdom without extradition after serving a prison sentence of at most six months. The formal offer was less explicit, simply stating that he would not be extradited to a country with the death penalty. Assange's lawyers declined, citing a need for further protection.[304]\nIn February 2019, the parliament of Geneva passed a motion demanding that the Swiss government extend asylum to Assange. The move was proposed by the Swiss People's Party and supported by the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland.[305] In the same month, it was revealed that Assange was issued with a new Australian passport in September 2018. His previous passport had expired several years ago.[306]\nIn 2015, la Repubblica lodged Freedom of Information requests in Australia, England, the United States and Sweden, seeking information about Assange. It said it was trying to discover whether US authorities told their UK counterparts in 2010 that they\u00a0intended to extradite Assange and also whether the Swedish investigation was used as a way of trying to extradite him to the US. la Repubblica said that its FOI requests had been hindered and delayed in all jurisdictions. However it said it was able to obtain evidence of the UK's role via the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in creating the \"legal and diplomatic quagmire\" which prevented Assange from leaving the Ecuadorian embassy. la Repubblica sued the CPS in 2017 to obtain further information but its case was rejected with the judge saying \"the need\u00a0for the British authorities\u00a0to protect the confidentiality of\u00a0the extradition process\u00a0outweighs\u00a0the public interest of the press to know\".[307] A further appeal was rejected in September 2019.[307][308]\nThe Ecuadorian government of Rafael Correa requested an advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the issue of \"the Institution of Asylum and its Recognition as a Human Right in the Inter-American System,\" and the court issued its advisory opinion in May 2018, upholding the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits signatories of the American Convention on Human Rights from deporting foreign individuals when such a deportation would likely lead to their persecution.[309] According to Doughty Street, the ruling was made shortly after US Vice-President Mike Pence raised the issue of Ecuador's grant of asylum to Assange while on a visit to Ecuador.[310]\nOn 5 February 2016, the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Assange had been subject to arbitrary detention by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison, on conditional bail and in the Ecuadorian embassy. According to the group, Assange should be allowed to walk free and be given compensation.[311][312] The UK and Swedish governments rejected the claim.[313] UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Hammond, said the claim was \"ridiculous\" and that the group was \"made up of lay people\", and called Assange a \"fugitive from justice\" who \"can come out any time he chooses\".[314] UK and Swedish prosecutors called the group's claims irrelevant.[315][316] The UK said it would arrest Assange should he leave the Ecuadorian embassy.[317] Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association, stated that the finding is \"not binding on British law\".[318] Noah Feldman, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, described the UN Working Group's conclusion as astonishing, summarising the conclusion as \"Assange might be charged with a crime in the US. Ecuador thinks charging him with violating national security law would amount to \"political persecution\" or worse. Therefore Sweden must give up on its claims to try him for rape, and Britain must ignore the Swedes' arrest warrant and let him leave the country.\"[319]\nThe Working Group again urged the UK to let Assange leave the Ecuador embassy in London freely. In a statement on 21 December 2018, the organisation asserted that the \"Swedish investigations have been closed for over 18 months now, and the only ground remaining for Mr Assange's continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK, which is, objectively, a minor offence that cannot post-facto justify the more than six years' confinement that he has been subjected to\".[320]\nIn 2019, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights rejected a complaint submitted by Assange, requesting that the Ecuadorian government \"ease the conditions it has imposed on his residence\" at the Ecuadorian embassy in London by monitoring him and restricting his visitors, and not allow him to be extradited to the United States.[321]\nIn 2019, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Prof. Nils Melzer stated that Assange had been subjected to mental torture [322] and demanded his release. He has repeatedly warned about Assange's deteriorating state of health. [323]\nIn April, Ecuador's president Lenin Moreno stated that Assange had violated the terms of his asylum, after photos surfaced on the internet linking Moreno to a corruption scandal.[324][325] WikiLeaks denied that it had acquired any of the published material, and stated that it merely reported on a corruption investigation against Moreno by Ecuador's legislature.[325] WikiLeaks subsequently wrote on Twitter that according to a source within the Ecuadorian government, an agreement had been reached to expel Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy and place him in the custody of UK police.[326][327] The source stated that the expulsion from the embassy would occur in retaliation against WikiLeaks' tweet noting corruption charges against Moreno.[326] Ecuador's Foreign Ministry denied the existence of any planned expulsion.[326][327]\nOn 11 April 2019, the Metropolitan Police were invited into the Ecuadorian embassy and arrested Assange in connection with his failure to surrender to the court in June 2012 for extradition to Sweden.[328] Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno stated that Ecuador withdrew Assange's asylum after he repeatedly violated international conventions regarding domestic interference.[329][330] Moreno referred to Assange as a \"spoiled brat\" and \"miserable hacker\".[331] British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the Ecuadorean president, Lenin Moreno, for co-operation and the British prime minister, Theresa May, said that \"no one is above the law\".[332] The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that Assange is \"not going to be given special treatment\u00a0... It has got nothing to do with [Australia], it is a matter for the US.\"[333]\nHours after Assange's arrest, programmer Ola Bini was arrested (but not charged) in Ecuador and interrogated about an alleged plot by unnamed Russian hackers to release compromising information about Moreno in retaliation. Bini had previously met with Assange at the embassy, posted a link to a news article about the plot to Twitter,[334] describing it as a \"witch hunt\", before leaving on a trip to Japan.[335]\nOn the afternoon of the day of his arrest Assange was charged with breaching the Bail Act 1976 and was found guilty after a short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.[336] Judge Michael Snow said Assange was \"a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest\" and he had \"not come close to establishing reasonable excuse\".[337] Assange was remanded to HM Prison Belmarsh, and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court to 50 weeks imprisonment.[23] The judge said he would be released after serving half his sentence, subject to other proceedings and conditioned upon committing no further offences.[338] The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued a statement through the website of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights that the verdict contravened \"principles of necessity and proportionality\" for what it considered a \"minor violation\".[339][340] Assange appealed his sentence, but dropped his appeal in July.[341]\nOn 10 April 2019, WikiLeaks said it had uncovered an extensive surveillance operation against Assange from within the Ecuadorian embassy, asserting that videotapes of Assange taken at the embassy constituted an invasion of privacy. WikiLeaks said that \"material including video, audio, copies of private legal documents and a medical report\" had surfaced in Spain and that unnamed individuals in Madrid had made an extortion attempt.[342][343]\nOn 26 September 2019 the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that the Spanish defence and security company Undercover Global S.L. (UC Global) had spied on Assange for the CIA during his time in the Ecuadorian embassy. UC Global had been contracted to protect the embassy during this time. According to the report UC Global's owner David Morales had provided the CIA with audio and video of meetings Assange held with his lawyers and colleagues. Morales also arranged for the US to have direct access to the stream from video cameras installed in the embassy at the beginning of December 2017. The evidence is part of a secret investigation by Spain's High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, into Morales and his relationship with US intelligence. The investigation was precipitated by a complaint by Assange that accused UC Global of violating his privacy and client-attorney privileges as well as committing misappropriation, bribery and money laundering.[344]\nMorales was arrested in September on charges involving violations of privacy and client-attorney privileges, as well as misappropriation, bribery, money laundering and criminal possession of weapons. He was released on bail. On 25 September, Spanish Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata sent British authorities a European Investigation Order (EIO) asking for permission to question Assange by videoconference as a witness in the case against Morales. The United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA), which is in charge of processing and responding to EIOs in the UK, provisionally denied De la Mata's request to question Assange, raised a number of objections to the request, and asked for more details. De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK. He said that the crimes were partially committed on Spanish territory because the microphones used to spy on Assange were bought in Spain, and the information obtained was sent and uploaded to servers at UC Global S. L.'s headquarters in Spain.[345]\nSpanish judicial bodies were upset at having their EIO request denied by UKCA and believed the British justice system is concerned by the effect the Spanish case may have on the process to extradite Assange to the US.[345]\nIn a November 2019 article Stefania Maurizi said she had access to some of the videos, audios and photos from the embassy showing a medical examination of Assange, a meeting between Ecuadorian ambassador Carlos Abad Ortiz and his staff, a meeting between Assange, Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda and lunch between Assange and British rapper M.I.A. Microphones had been placed in the women's toilets to capture meetings between Assange and his lawyers. Phones belonging to some of the embassy's visitors were compromised. Spanish lawyer Aitor Martinez, who is part of Assange's legal team, said videos were taken of meetings between Assange and his legal defence team.  Maurizi concluded that, based on statements from former employees of UC Global, internal UC Global emails and the type of information collected, it was clear that the surveillance was conducted on behalf of the US government and the information gathered would be used by the US to assist in its case for extraditing Assange.[346]\nIn late November 2019 Britain agreed to allow Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata to interview Assange at Westminster Magistrates Court via video link on 20 December.[347] According to his lawyer, Assange testified that he was unaware that cameras installed by Undercover Global were also capturing audio and suggested the surveillance likely targeted his legal team.[348]\nIn 2012 and 2013, US officials indicated that Assange was not named in a sealed indictment.[349][350] On 6 March 2018, a federal grand jury for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a sealed indictment against Assange.[351]\nIn November 2018, US prosecutors accidentally revealed that Assange had been indicted under seal in US federal court; the revelation came as a result of an error in a different court filing, unrelated to Assange.[352][353][354][355][356]\nOn 11 April 2019, the day of Assange's arrest in London, the indictment against him was unsealed.[357] He was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion (i.e. hacking into a government computer), a relatively minor crime that carries a maximum 5-year sentence if found guilty.[358][359] The charges stem from the allegation that Assange attempted and failed to crack a password hash so that Chelsea Manning could use a different username to download classified documents and avoid detection.[224] This information had been known since 2011 and was a component of Manning's trial; the indictment did not reveal any new information about Assange.[224][360]\nOn 23 May, Assange was indicted on 17 new charges relating to the Espionage Act of 1917 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.[361] The Espionage Act charges carry a maximum sentence of 170 years in prison.[362] The Obama administration had debated charging Assange under the Espionage Act but decided against it out of fear that it would have a negative effect on investigative journalism and could be unconstitutional. The new charges relate to obtaining and publishing the secret documents. Most of these charges relate to obtaining the secret documents. The three charges related to publication concern documents which revealed the names of sources in dangerous places putting them \"at a grave and imminent risk\" of harm or detention. The New York Times commented that it and other news organisations obtained the same documents as WikiLeaks also without government authorisation. It also said it is not clear how WikiLeaks's publications are legally different from other publications of classified information.[363][364]\nMost cases brought under the Espionage Act have been against government employees who accessed sensitive information and leaked it to journalists and others.[365] Prosecuting people for acts related to receiving and publishing information has not previously been tested in court.[363] In 1975, the Justice Department decided after consideration not to charge journalist Seymour Hersh for reporting on US surveillance of the Soviet Union.[365] Two lobbyists for a pro-Israel group were charged in 2005 with receiving and sharing classified information about American policy toward Iran. The charges however did not relate to the publication of the documents and the case was dropped by the Justice Department in 2009 prior to judgement.[363][365]\nAssistant Attorney General John Demers said \"Julian Assange is no journalist\".[366] The US allegation that Assange's publication of these secrets was illegal was deemed controversial by Australia's Seven News as well as CNN.[364][367] The Cato Institute also questioned the US government's position which attempts to position Assange as not a journalist.[368] The Associated Press said Assange's indictment presented media freedom issues, as Assange's solicitation and publication of classified information is a routine job journalists perform.[369]\nStephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, stated that what Assange is accused of doing is factually different from but legally similar to what professional journalists do.[370] Vladeck also said the Espionage Act charges could provide Assange with an argument against extradition under the US-UK treaty as there is an exemption in the treaty for political offences.[364] Forbes magazine stated that the US government created outcry among journalists in its indictment of Assange as the US sought to debate if Assange was a journalist or not.[371] Suzanne Nossel of PEN America said it was immaterial if Assange was a journalist or publisher and pointed instead to first amendment concerns.[372]\nSeveral jurists, politicians, associations, academics and campaigners consider that the arrest of Assange constitutes an attack on freedom of the press and international law.[373][374][375] The Reporters Without Borders said Assange's arrest could \"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistle-blowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future.\"[376] Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, wrote that Assange's prosecution for publishing leaked documents is \"a major threat to global media freedom\".[377] Independent United Nations rights experts such as Agnes Callamard said \"the arrest of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange by police in the United Kingdom, after the Ecuadorian Government decided to stop granting him asylum in their London embassy, exposed him to the risk of serious human rights violations, if extradited to the United States\".[378]\nWikiLeaks was recognised as a \"media organisation\" in 2017 by a UK tribunal, contradicting public assertions to the contrary by some US officials, and possibly supporting Assange's efforts to oppose his extradition to the United States.[379][380][381][382] This is why the Dutch senator Tiny Kox asked the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatovic, whether the arrest of Assange and his possible extradition to the US are in line with the criteria of the European Convention on Human Rights, because Assange can benefit from the protection of the right to freedom of expression and information according the Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.[383]\nBritish Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed \"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and his extradition to the United States \"should be opposed by the British government\".[376]\nEva Joly, magistrate and MEP, said that \"the arrest of Julian Assange is an attack on freedom of expression, international law and right to asylum\".[384] Sevim Dagdelen, a German Bundestag MP who specialises in international law and press law, describes Assange's arrest as \"an attack on independent journalism\" and says that he \"is today seriously endangered\".[385][386] Dick Marty, a former state prosecutor of Ticino and rapporteur on the CIA's secret prisons for the Council of Europe, considers the arrest of whistleblowers \"very shocking\".[387][388] Several well-known Swiss jurists have asked the Federal Council to grant asylum to the founder of Wikileaks because he is threatened with extradition to the United States, which in the past \"silenced whistleblowers\".[389][390]\nThe French Union of Journalists (Syndicat national des journalistes (CGT)\u00a0[fr]), said that \"the dissemination of documents or information of public interest\" could not be considered a legal offence. The union called on Britain \"to refuse the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States and to release him.\"[391]\nIn a letter, several French Union of Journalists (Syndicat national des journalistes (CGT)\u00a0[fr]) and (Syndicat national des journalistes (CFDT)\u00a0[fr]) ask to Emmanuel Macron to enforce Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights . According them, \"Faced with threats to Julian Assange's health and at the risk of seeing him sentenced to life imprisonment, we are saying loud and clear, with the IFJ (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale des journalistes) that \"journalism is not a crime\". They add \"Julian Assange denounced in his publications war crimes condemned by the Geneva Convention. Today, he is the one we would like to imprison, we would like to silence. ..... We consider this case one of the most serious attacks on the freedom of the press, against public freedoms within the EU. The IFJ, the French unions and their Australian counterparts have launched a motion to seize this serious case the UN Human Rights Council and the European Parliament and the Council of Europe\".[392]\nThe yellow vests movement called for Assange's release.[393][394][395]\nWhile some US politicians supported the arrest and indictment of Julian Assange, several non-governmental organisations of press freedom condemned it.\nMark Warner, vice-chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, welcomed the arrest of Assange, saying that Assange was \"a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security\".[396] The president of the Center for American Progress and former Obama aide Neera Tanden also welcomed the arrest and condemned Assange's leftist supporters, tweeting that \"the Assange cultists are the worst. Assange was the agent of a proto-fascist state, Russia, to undermine democracy. That is fascist behaviour. Anyone on the left should abhor what he did.\"[396]\nThe deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Robert Mahoney, said \"With this prosecution of Julian Assange, the US government could set out broad legal arguments about journalists soliciting information or interacting with sources that could have chilling consequences for investigative reporting and the publication of information of public interest.[375] According Yochai Benkler, a Harvard law professor, the charge sheet contained some \"very dangerous elements that pose significant risk to national security reporting. Sections of the indictment are vastly overbroad and could have a significant chilling effect \u2013 they ought to be rejected.\"[375] Carrie DeCell, staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the charges \"risk having a chill on journalism\".[375] She added,\"Many of the allegations fall absolutely within the first amendment's protections of journalistic activity. That's very troubling to us.\"[375]\nBen Wizner from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) speculated that if authorities were to prosecute Assange \"for violating US secrecy laws [it] would set an especially dangerous precedent for US journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\"[397][398][397][398]\nNSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg condemned the indictment.[399][400] Snowden tweeted that \"Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom.\"[401] Daniel Ellsberg said \"Forty-eight years ago, I was the first journalistic source to be indicted. There have been perhaps a dozen since then, nine under President Obama. But Julian Assange is the first journalist to be indicted. If he is extradited to the U.S. and convicted, he will not be the last.  The First Amendment is a pillar of our democracy and this is an assault on it. If freedom of speech is violated to this extent, our republic is in danger. Unauthorized disclosures are the lifeblood of the republic.\"[402][403]\nAccording to Ron Paul, Assange should receive the same kind of protections as the mainstream media when it comes to releasing information. He said \"In a free society we're supposed to know the truth\u00a0 ... In a society where truth becomes treason, then we're in big trouble. And now, people who are revealing the truth are getting into trouble for it.\" He added \"This is media, isn't it? I mean, why don't we prosecute The New York Times or anybody that releases this?\"[404]\nIn October 2019 former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce called for the Federal Government to take action to stop Assange being extradited from the United Kingdom to the US. Later in October, the cross-party \"Bring Assange Home Parliamentary Working Group\" was established. Its co-chairs are independent MP Andrew Wilkie and North Queensland politician George Christensen. Its members include Greens Richard Di Natale, Adam Bandt and Peter Whish-Wilson, Centre Alliance MPs Rebekha Sharkie and Rex Patrick and independent MP Zali Steggall. The working group will request to visit Assange to determine what support they can provide.[405]\nFormer Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa condemned Assange's arrest.[406] Bolivian President Evo Morales also condemned it.[332] Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the indictment.[407][332] In January 2020, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted to oppose Assange\u2019s extradition to the US.[408]\nSince his arrest at the embassy, Assange has been incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh in London.[23]\nAfter examining Assange on 9 May 2019, United Nations special rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Nils Melzer concluded, \"in addition to physical ailments, Mr Assange showed all symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma.\"[409] The British government said it supported the important work of the rapporteur's mandate but disagreed with some of his observations.[410] In a later interview Melzer criticised the \"secretive grand jury indictment in the United States\", the \"abusive manner in which Swedish prosecutors disseminated, re-cycled and perpetuated their 'preliminary investigation' into alleged sexual offences\", the \"termination by Ecuador of Mr Assange's asylum status and citizenship without any form of due process\", and the \"overt bias against Mr Assange being shown by British judges since his arrest\". He said the United States, UK, Sweden and Ecuador were trying to make an example of Assange. He also accused journalists of \"spreading abusive and deliberately distorted narratives\".[411] Shortly after Melzer's visit, Assange was transferred to the prison's health care unit.[412]\nOn 13 September, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that Assange would not be released on 22 September when his prison term ended, because he was a flight risk and his lawyer had not applied for bail.[413] She said when his sentence came to an end, his status would change from a serving prisoner to a person facing extradition.[413]\nOn 1 November 2019, Melzer said Assange's health had continued to deteriorate and his life was now at risk.[414][412] He said that the UK government had not acted on the issue.\"[414][412] In November 2019, an open letter signed by more than 60 doctors said Assange's health was declining to an extent that he could die in prison.[415] On 30 December 2019, Melzer accused the UK government of torturing Julian Assange. He said Assange's \"continued exposure to severe mental and emotional suffering ... clearly amounts to psychological torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"[416][417]\nOn 2 May 2019, the first hearing was held in London into the United States request for Assange's extradition. When asked by the judge whether he consented to the extradition, Assange replied \"I do not wish to surrender myself for extradition for doing journalism that has won many, many awards and protected many people\".[418]\nOn 13 June, British Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he had signed the US extradition order.[419] On 14 June, a procedural hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court decided that a full extradition hearing should begin in February 2020.[420]\nOn 21 October 2019, Assange appeared at the court for a case management hearing. Judge Vanessa Baraitser denied Assange's defence lawyers' request for a three-month delay so that they could gather evidence. Government prosecutor James Lewis QC and the US opposed any delay.[421][422][423] When the judge asked about his understanding of the proceedings Assange replied:\n\"I don't understand how this is equitable. This superpower had 10 years to prepare for this case and I can't access my writings. It's very difficult where I am to do anything but these people have unlimited resources. They are saying journalists and whistleblowers are enemies of the people. They have unfair advantages dealing with documents. They [know] the interior of my life with my psychologist. They steal my children's DNA. This is not equitable what is happening here\".[421]In January 2020, both sides of the case asked for more time to prepare. The judge reluctantly agreed, scheduling one week of hearings from 24 February and another three weeks from 18 May.[424]\nAssange describes himself as an advocate of information transparency and market libertarianism.[425] He has written a few short pieces, including \"State and terrorist conspiracies\" (2006),[426] \"Conspiracy as governance\" (2006),[427] \"The hidden curse of Thomas Paine\" (2008),[428] \"What's new about WikiLeaks?\" (2011),[429] and the foreword to Cypherpunks (2012).[144] Cypherpunks is primarily a transcript of the World Tomorrow episode eight two-part interview between Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn, and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmermann. In the foreword, Assange said, \"the Internet, our greatest tool for emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen\".[144] He also contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997),[51] and received a co-writer credit for the Calle 13 song \"Multi_Viral\" (2013).\nAssange's book, When Google Met WikiLeaks, was published by OR Books on 18 September 2014.[430] The book recounts when Google CEO Eric Schmidt requested a meeting with Assange, while he was on bail in rural Norfolk, UK. Schmidt was accompanied by Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas; Lisa Shields, vice-president of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Scott Malcomson, the communications director for the International Crisis Group. Excerpts were published on the Newsweek website, while Assange participated in a Q&amp;A event that was facilitated by the Reddit website and agreed to an interview with Vogue magazine.[431][432][433]\nIn her 2017 documentary on Assange, Laura Poitras included a scene of him calling the Swedish sexual assault allegations a \"radical feminist conspiracy\"\u2014a comment which she says led them to part ways.[434] In 2011, Assange criticised a Private Eye article for portraying WikiLeaks contributor Israel Shamir as anti-Semitic. According to editor Ian Hislop, Assange called the article \"an obvious attempt to deprive [WikiLeaks] of Jewish support and donations\" and went on to point out that several journalists involved were Jewish. On 1 March 2011, Assange released a statement in which he said, \"Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase. In particular, 'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and word. It is serious and upsetting. We treasure our strong Jewish support and staff, just as we treasure the support from pan-Arab democracy activists and others who share our hope for a just world.\"[435][436]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nHugh John Mungo Grant[1] (born 9 September 1960) is an English actor and film producer. Grant has received a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, and an Honorary C\u00e9sar for his work. As of 2018[update], his films have grossed a total of nearly US$3\u00a0billion worldwide from 29\u00a0theatrical releases.[2] He first received attention after earning the Volpi Cup for his performance in the film Maurice (1987) but achieved international success after appearing in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994).[3] He used this breakthrough role as a frequent cinematic persona during the 1990s, delivering comic performances in films such as Notting Hill (1999) and Mickey Blue Eyes (1999). For Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Grant's starring role in the popular Four Weddings and a Funeral in 1994 made him one of the best known figures in 1990s' British popular culture, and he was seen as a charming, vulnerable, witty romantic lead. By the turn of the 21st century, he had established himself as a leading man, skilled with a satirical comic talent.[4] In the early 2000s he expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), Love Actually (2003), and American Dreamz (2006).[5] He later played against type with multiple roles in the epic sci-fi drama film, Cloud Atlas (2012). He is also known for appearing in period pieces such as The Remains of the Day (1993) and Sense and Sensibility (1995). Most recently, he received critical acclaim for his portrayals of St. Clair Bayfield in Florence Foster Jenkins (2016); Phoenix Buchanan, an antagonist in Paddington 2 (2017);[6][7] and Jeremy Thorpe in the BBC One miniseries A Very English Scandal (2018).[8] He was BAFTA-nominated for all three performances, and received Golden Globe Award nominations for Florence Foster Jenkins and A Very English Scandal. Within the film industry, Grant has been known as a meticulous performer and as an anti-star who approaches his roles like a character actor, working hard to make his acting appear spontaneous.[9] Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms. The entertainment media's coverage of his life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor.[10] He has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, his disdain towards the culture of celebrity, and his hostility towards the media.[11][12] He emerged as a prominent critic of the conduct of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation during the News International phone hacking scandal.[13][14][15] In a career spanning more than 35\u00a0years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling but rather a career that developed by happenstance.[16] Grant was born on 9 September 1960[17] at Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith, London, the second son of Fynvola Susan MacLean (b. Wickham, Hampshire, 11 October 1933; d. Hounslow, London, July 2001) and Captain James Murray Grant (b. 1929).[18] His grandfather, Colonel James Murray Grant, DSO was decorated for bravery and leadership at Saint-Valery-en-Caux during World War II.[19] Genealogist Antony Adolph has described Grant's family history as \"a colourful Anglo-Scottish tapestry of warriors, empire-builders and aristocracy\".[20] His ancestors include William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan, James Stewart,[20][21][22] John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Sir Evan Nepean, and a sister of former Prime Minister Spencer Perceval.[23] Grant's father was an officer in the Seaforth Highlanders for eight years in Malaya and Germany.[24] He ran a carpet firm, pursued hobbies such as golf and painting watercolours, and raised his family in Chiswick, west London, where the Grants lived next to Arlington Park Mansions on Sutton Lane.[25][26] In September 2006, a collection of Capt. Grant's paintings was hosted by the John Martin Gallery in a charity exhibition, organised by his son, called \"James Grant: 30\u00a0Years of Watercolours\".[27] His mother worked as a schoolteacher and taught Latin, French and music for more than 30\u00a0years in the state schools of west London.[28] She died at the age of 67, 18 months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.[29] On Inside the Actors Studio in 2002, he credited his mother with \"any acting genes that [he] might have\".[26] Both his parents were children of military families,[30] but, despite his parents' backgrounds, he has stated that his family was not always affluent while he was growing up.[31] He spent many of his childhood summers shooting and fishing with his grandfather in Scotland.[25] Grant has an older brother, James \"Jamie\" Grant, who is a New York-based investment banker.[25][32] Grant started his education at Hogarth Primary School in Chiswick but then moved to St Peter's Primary School in Hammersmith; he was then educated at an independent preparatory school, Wetherby School. From 1969 to 1978, he attended the independent Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith on a scholarship and played 1st XV rugby, cricket and football for the school.[33][34] He also represented Latymer on the quiz show, Top of the Form, an academic competition between two teams of four secondary school students each.[26] In 1979, he won the Galsworthy scholarship to New College, Oxford. He studied English and graduated with 2:1 honours.[35] Viewing acting as nothing more than a creative outlet,[36] he joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and was Fabian in a production of Twelfth Night.[37][38] He also starred in his first film, Privileged (1982), produced by the Oxford University Film Foundation. Actress Anna Chancellor, who met Grant while she was still at university, has recalled, \"I first met Hugh at a party at Oxford. There was something magical about him. He was a star even then, without having done anything.\"[39] He received an offer from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London to pursue a PhD in the history of art, but decided not to take the offer because he failed to secure a grant.[40] After making his debut in the Oxford-financed film Privileged (1982), Grant dabbled in a variety of jobs, such as working as an assistant groundsman at Fulham Football Club,[41] tutoring, writing comedy sketches for TV shows,[42] and working for Talkback Productions to write and produce radio commercials for products such as Mighty White bread and Red Stripe lager.[43] At a screening of Privileged at BAFTA in London, he was approached by a talent agent offering to represent him. Still intending to begin his MPhil at the Courtauld Institute, Grant declined, but then later reconsidered, thinking that acting for a year would be a good way to save some money for his studies.[44] Soon afterwards he was offered a supporting role in The Bounty (1984) starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, but was prevented from playing the role because he didn't yet have an Equity card, which could only be earned through acting in regional theatre.[44] To obtain his Equity card, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse and lived for a year at Park Terrace in The Park Estate in Nottingham.[45] Richard Digby Day directed him in small roles at the Nottingham Playhouse in Lady Windermere's Fan, an avant-garde production of Hamlet, and Coriolanus.[46][47] Bored with small acting parts, Grant created a sketch-comedy group called The Jockeys of Norfolk, a name taken from Shakespeare's Richard III, with friends Chris Lang and Andy Taylor. The group toured London's pub comedy circuit with stops at The George IV in Chiswick, Canal Cafe Theatre in Little Venice and The King's Head in Islington.[48] The Jockeys of Norfolk proved a hit at the 1985 Edinburgh Festival Fringe[49] after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on Russell Harty's BBC2 TV show Harty Goes to\u00a0....[50][51][52] In 1986 he played Eric Birling in a production of An Inspector Calls at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, directed by Richard Wilson,[53] giving a performance that Grevel Lindop, writing in the Times Literary Supplement, described as \"outstanding\".[54] In 1985 and 1986, Grant had minor roles in eight television productions, including TV films, historical miniseries, and single episodes of series. His first leading film role came in Merchant-Ivory's Edwardian drama film Maurice (1987), adapted from E. M. Forster's novel.[55] He and co-star James Wilby shared the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for their portrayals of lovers Clive Durham and Maurice Hall, respectively.[56][57] During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he balanced small roles on television with film work, which included playing Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere in the BAFTA Award-nominated White Mischief (1987),[58][59] and a supporting role in The Dawning (1988) opposite Anthony Hopkins and Jean Simmons. In 1988 he had a leading role in Ken Russell's horror film, The Lair of the White Worm. He was Lord Byron in a Goya Award-winning Spanish production called Remando al viento (1988), and portrayed legendary champagne merchant Charles Heidsieck in the television film Champagne Charlie (1989). In 1990, he had a small role in the sport/crime drama The Big Man, opposite Liam Neeson, in which Grant assumed a Scottish accent; the film explores the life of a Scottish miner (Neeson) who becomes unemployed during a union strike. In 1991, he played Julie Andrews' gay son in the ABC made-for-television film Our Sons.[60] In 1991 he starred as Frederic Chopin in Impromptu, opposite Judy Davis as his lover George Sand. Although his performance received little mention at the time, 25 years after the fact David Yearsley in CounterPunch wrote: If an honest history about classical music on the big screen were to be written, the laurels for greatest performance would go to ... that loveable master of self-effacing charm, bumbling bonhomie, and buoyantly melancholic repartee, Hugh Grant ... [for] his definitive turn as Frederic Chopin .... Grant gave us a pale and haughty genius, seemingly self-assured yet painfully fragile beneath the fa\u00e7ade, and not just because of his hacking ill health. As the rigid yet passionate composer-pianist, Grant has never been funnier or truer.[61] In 1992, he appeared in Roman Polanski's film Bitter Moon, portraying a fastidious and proper British tourist who is married, but finds himself enticed by the sexual hedonism of a seductive French woman and her embittered, paraplegic American husband. The film was called an \"anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty\" by the Washington Post.[62] In 1993 he had a supporting role in the Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day. In typical tongue-in-cheek style, Grant later jokingly called many of the productions of his early career \"Europuddings, where you would have a French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they thought that was the way to sell it to America.\"[63] At 32, Grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994).[4] \"If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you'd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny\", he later recalled.[3] Released in 1994 with Grant as the protagonist, Four Weddings and a Funeral became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244\u00a0million,[2] making him an overnight international star. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew, it earned Grant a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also temporarily typecast him as the lead character, Charles, a bohemian and debonair bachelor. Grant saw it as an inside joke that the star, due to the parts he played, was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter (Richard Curtis), who is known for writing about himself and his own life.[63][64] Grant later expressed: Although I owe whatever success I've had to Four Weddings and a Funeral, it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions: One was that I was that character \u2013 when in fact nothing could be further from the truth, as I'm sure Richard would tell you \u2013 and the other frustrating thing was that they thought that's all I could do. I suppose, because those films happened to be successful, no one, perhaps understandably, ... bothered to rent all the other films I'd done.[4] In July 1994, he signed a two-year production deal with Castle Rock Entertainment and by October, he became founder and director of the UK-based Simian Films Limited.[65] He appointed his then-girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley, as the head of development to look for prospective projects. Simian Films produced two Grant vehicles in the 1990s and lost a bid to produce About a Boy to Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions.[66] The company closed its US office in 2002 and Grant resigned as director in December 2005.[67] Before the release of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant had reunited with its director Mike Newell for the tragicomedy An Awfully Big Adventure (1995), which was labelled a \"determinedly off-beat film\" by The New York Times.[68] He portrayed a bitchy, supercilious director of a repertory company in post-World War II Liverpool. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"It shows that he has range as an actor\",[69] but the San Francisco Chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film \"plays like a vanity production for Grant\".[70] Janet Maslin, praising Grant as \"superb\" and \"a dashing cad under any circumstances\", commented, \"For him this film represents the road not taken. Made before Four Weddings and a Funeral was released, it captures Mr. Grant as the clever, versatile character actor he was then becoming, rather than the international dreamboat he is today.\"[68] His next role was as a cartographer in 1917 Wales in The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain (1995). Grant's first studio-financed Hollywood project was opposite Julianne Moore in Chris Columbus's comedy Nine Months (1995). Though a hit at the box office, it was almost universally panned by critics. The Washington Post called it a \"grotesquely pandering caper\" and singled out Grant's performance, as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriend's unexpected pregnancy, for his \"insufferable muggings\".[71] Grant himself has been highly critical of his performance in Nine Months, stating in a 2016 interview: \"I really ruined it. And it was entirely my fault. I panicked, it was such a big jump up from what I'd been paid before to what they were offering me. And the scale was inhuman to my standards, you know the scale of the production, 20th Century Fox, the whole thing. And I just tried much too hard, and you know I forgot to do basic acting things, like mean it. So I pulled faces and overacted, it was a shocker.\"[44] Next in 1995, he starred as Emma Thompson's suitor in her Academy Award-winning adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, directed by Ang Lee. In 1995 he also performed in Restoration; Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote that Grant is \"having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter\",[72] and Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times said he has \"some delicious moments\" in the film.[73] He made his debut as a film producer with the 1996 thriller Extreme Measures. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with Siskel writing \"Hugh Grant's work in Extreme Measures is a refreshing standout.\"[74] After a three-year hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for Four Weddings and a Funeral. This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363\u00a0million worldwide.[2] As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, \"Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds.\"[75] Reactions to his Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, \"Grant's performance stands as an emblem of what's wrong with Notting Hill. What's maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. He's become one of those actors who's all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly crow's feet to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out.\"[76] The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grant's turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the New York Times called \"a delightfully funny deadpan\".[77] Grant also released his second production output, a fish-out-of-water mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office, and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role. Roger Ebert thought, \"Hugh Grant is wrong for the role [and] strikes one wrong note and then another\",[78] whereas Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said, \"If he'd been on the Titanic, fewer lives would have been lost. If he'd accompanied Robert Scott to the South Pole, the explorer would have lived to be 100. That's how good Hugh Grant is at rescuing doomed ventures.\"[79] While promoting Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks (2000) on NBC's The Today Show in 2000, Grant told host Matt Lauer, \"It's my millennium of bastards\".[80] Small Time Crooks starred Grant, in the words of film critic Andrew Sarris, as \"a petty, petulant, faux-Pygmalion art dealer, David, [who] is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters Mr. Allen has ever created\".[81] In a role devoid of his comic attributes, the New York Times wrote: \"Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation.\"[82] In 2000, Grant also joined the Supervisory Board of IM Internationalmedia AG, the powerful Munich-based film and media company.[83] In 2001, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary was proclaimed by Variety to be \"as sly an overthrow of a star's polished posh \u2013 and nice \u2013 poster image as any comic turn in memory\".[84] The film, adapted from Helen Fielding's novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281\u00a0million worldwide.[2] He was, according to the Washington Post, fitting as \"a cruel, manipulative cad, hiding behind the male god's countenance that he knows all too well\".[85] In 2002, Grant's \"immaculate comic performance\" (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics.[86] Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) was determined by the Washington Post to be \"that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings\".[87] Rolling Stone wrote, \"The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [and he] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs\",[88] while Roger Ebert observed that \"the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource\".[89] Released a day after the blockbuster Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones, About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129\u00a0million globally.[2] The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2002.[90] \"His performance can only be described as revelatory\", wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that \"Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness.\"[87] The New York Observer concluded: \"[The film] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance.\"[91] About a Boy also marked a notable change in his boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it \"looked good on him\".[92] He added that Grant's \"pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency.\"[92] He was paired with Sandra Bullock in Warner Bros.'s Two Weeks Notice (2002), which made $199\u00a0million internationally but received poor reviews.[2] The Village Voice concluded that Grant's creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was \"little more than a Britishism machine\".[93] Two Weeks Notice was followed by the 2003 ensemble comedy, Love Actually, headlined by Grant as the British Prime Minister. A Christmas release by Working Title Films, the film was promoted as \"the ultimate romantic comedy\" and accumulated $246\u00a0million at the international box office.[2] It marked the directorial debut of Richard Curtis, who told the New York Times that Grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier Curtis incarnations.[94] Roger Ebert claimed that \"Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian\" and has \"so much self-confidence that he plays the British prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport\".[95] Film critic Rex Reed, on the contrary, called his performance \"an oversexed bachelor spin on Tony Blair\" as the star \"flirted with himself in the paroxysm of self-love that has become his acting style\".[96] In 2004, he reprised his role as Daniel Cleaver for a small part in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, which, like its predecessor, made more than $262\u00a0million commercially.[2] Gone from the screen for two years, Grant next re-teamed with Paul Weitz (About a Boy) for the black comedy American Dreamz (2006). Grant starred as the acerbic host of an American Idol-like reality show where, according to Caryn James of the New York Times, \"nothing is real ... except the black hole at the centre of the host's heart, as Mr. Grant takes Mr. Cowell's villainous act to its limit\".[97] American Dreamz failed financially but Grant was generously praised. He played his self-aggrandising character, an amalgam of Simon Cowell and Ryan Seacrest, with smarmy self-loathing. The Boston Globe proposed that this \"just may be the great comic role that has always eluded Hugh Grant\",[98] and critic Carina Chocano said, \"He is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy.\"[99] In 2007, he starred opposite Drew Barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as \"a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough\".[100] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs,[30] Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!.[11] The film, with its revenues totalling $145\u00a0million, allowed him to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame.\"[101] In 2009, he starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy Did You Hear About the Morgans?, which was a critical failure but was a box office success.[102] Grant was featured in the Wachowskis' and Tom Tykwer's epic science fiction film Cloud Atlas in 2012, playing six different dark characters.[103]. In the same year, Grant lent his voice to the Aardman stop motion animation The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!.[104] He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film The Rewrite (2014), starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant's performance was praised by many critics;[105][106] director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favourites of the year and called Grant a \"perfect leading man\".[107] In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E.;[108] Entertainment Weekly described his performance as \"the only bit of fun\" in the film,[109] and Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that \"while it can't be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably\".[110] In 2016, Grant played St. Clair Bayfield, partner of the title character, in the film Florence Foster Jenkins, directed by Stephen Frears and starring Meryl Streep. His performance drew raves from film critics as \"career-best\" (Screen International), \"one of his best performances in years\" (Indiewire), \"best work of his career\" (Variety) where he \"goes deeper, darker and riskier\" (Rolling Stone).[111][112][113][114] Rafer Guzman of Newsday said \"Surely the 55-year-old actor has just sealed his first-ever Oscar nomination.\"[115] Carrie Rickey of Yahoo! Movies commented that Grant \"deserves the Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the recognition \u2014 finally \u2014 that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors\".[116] He was nominated for his first individual Screen Actors Guild Award and also earned nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Critics' Choice Award, a Satellite Award and a European Film Award. Several critics put his work among the best acting performances of the year.[117][118] Most award pundits predicted Grant would receive his first Academy Award nomination for his performance but he was not nominated.[119][120][121] His next appearance was as Phoenix Buchanan, a villain in the family film Paddington 2,[122] which was a commercial and critical success. The Guardian described his performance as \"scene-stealing\",[123] while IGN commented \"Grant continues to make an astonishing comeback in his career, once again by playing into his expert comedic abilities as Phoenix Buchanan, who dons each of his ridiculous disguises with a kind of egotistical obliviousness that Grant is perfect at pulling off.\"[124] Grant went on to win London Film Critics' Circle Award for Supporting Actor of the Year and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. Grant's performance was ranked as the 22nd greatest movie performance of the decade by IndieWire in 2019.[125] In 2018, Grant returned to television screens after 25 years, as Jeremy Thorpe in the BBC One miniseries A Very English Scandal, which marked his second collaboration with director Stephen Frears.[126] The miniseries, and in particular Grant, were widely and highly praised. Digital Spy's review stated that \"There's always been a bit of the devil in Grant's best turns, and in Thorpe, a man with a fully-realised dark side, he's found his richest part in years\".[127] The New Statesman wrote \"Hugh Grant is Thorpe, and everything about his performance is exactly so. It's the role of Grant's life, and he performs it even more brilliantly than he did Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2.\"[128] The Sunday Times stated \"It's become tediously predictable to praise this drama but, as Thorpe, Hugh Grant really has proved he's getting better as he's getting older\".[129] The Guardian called him \"utterly captivating\",[130] and the Boston Globe wrote \"Grant is a revelation\".[131] The New Yorker stated \"Hugh Grant gives a brilliant performance as Thorpe, whose arrogance, charm, and profoundly evasive nature he captures with subtlety. A quarter century after Grant established himself as everyone's crush with his romantic-comedy d\u00e9but, in Four Weddings and a Funeral ... the actor, who is now in his late fifties, has turned out to have a gift for conveying what happens to an individual when charm curdles into something considerably darker.\"[132] Grant was nominated for several awards for his performance, including Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.[133] In 2019, Grant played another against-type role, in Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen, his second collaboration with the director following The Man From U.N.C.L.E.[134] Grant plays Fletcher, a seedy and unscrupulous tabloid reporter, which he called \"a fun bit of casting\" referring to his Hacked Off campaigning. He has stated he based his character on reporters who \"used to be my enemies and now they\u2019re my friends\".[135] Even though the film received mostly mixed reviews,[136] Grant's performance was praised. Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter called Grant \"a beating comic heart\" of the film, adding that \"he weighs up every wry line with relish, and Ritchie makes strong use of his deadpan comic talents.\"[137] Joe Morgenstern of Wall Street Journal also highly praised his work, writing, \"[I]n a word, Mr. Grant is sensational. In two more words, he's absolutely hilarious; it's some of the best work he's done on screen.\"[138] Grant has predominantly been a comedy (especially a romantic comedy) actor for almost all of his mainstream film career. While some film critics, such as Roger Ebert, have defended the limited variety of his performances, others have dismissed him as a one-trick pony. Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a long-time collaborator, said, \"His range hasn't been fully tested, but each performance is unique.\"[139] Many of Grant's films in the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, he was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously.[45] These performances were sometimes deemed excessive, in the words of Washington Post's Rita Kempley, due to his \"comic overreactions\u2014the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids\". She added: \"He's got more tics than Benny Hill.\"[140] His penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, he must get \"his jiving and shucking under control\".[141] Film historian David Thomson opined in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film that Grant equated merely \"itchy mannerisms\" with screen acting.[142] On his choice of roles, Grant has said: I've never been tempted to do the part where I cry or get AIDS or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews. I genuinely believe that comedy acting, light comedy acting, is as hard as, if not harder than serious acting, and it genuinely doesn't bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by knee-jerk reaction go to the deepest, darkest, most serious performances and parts. It makes me laugh.[143] Grant's screen persona in his films of the 2000s gradually developed into a cynical, self-loathing cad.[144] Claudia Puig of USA Today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally \"gone [were] the self-conscious 'Aren't I adorable' mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of his film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies\".[145] According to Carina Chocano, amongst film critics, the two tropes most commonly associated with Grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in Bridget Jones's Diary and About a Boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself.[146] Nonetheless, Grant has occasionally acted in dramas. He played a sleazy, snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film An Awfully Big Adventure, which received critical praise, and for \"a very quiet, dignified\" performance as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin in James Lapine's biopic film Impromptu.[147][148] In 2012, he played six \"incredibly evil\" characters in the epic drama film Cloud Atlas, an experience he has spoken about positively. Grant said: I do a lot of killing and raping [in the film]... But it was a laugh. I thought before I read it that I'd turn it down, which I normally do, but I was interested in meeting [Cloud Atlas co-directors] the Wachowskis because I have always admired them enormously. And they are so charming and fascinating.... I slightly called my own bluff. In one of the parts I am a cannibal, about 2,000 years in the future, and I thought, \"I can do that. It's easy.\" And then I am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in Germany and they are saying, \"You know, hungry! We must have that flesh-eating, like a leopard who is so hungry\", and I am thinking, \"I can't do that! Just give me a witty line!\"[149] Grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press[150] and is known in the media for his guarded privacy.[151] On probing of his personal life, he has remained steadfast in \"offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough\".[152] He has described himself as a reluctant actor, has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be \"a phase\" in his life, lasting no more than ten years.[63][153] A 2007 Vogue profile referred to him as a man with a \"professionally misanthropic mystique\".[11] He has expressed distaste for focus groups, market research, and emphasis on opening weekend box-office numbers, saying: \"It's so destructive to the filmmaking process. What was wrong with the way they used to release films, more slowly, let them build?\"[154] The director Mike Newell has said: \"There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him that's gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy.\"[155] Filmmaker Paul Weitz said that Grant is funny and that \"he perceives flaws in himself and other people, and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless\".[156] British newspapers regularly refer to him as \"grumpy\".[157] Grant is a self-confessed \"committed and passionate\" perfectionist on a film set.[16] The American film critic Dave Kehr has written that Grant \"is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role \u2013 someone who works hard to make it look easy \u2013 though that isn't a trait he admires in himself\".[9] He is noted by co-workers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard.[11][158][159] He dropped his agent in 2006, ending a 10-year relationship with CAA.[160] He has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career: \"They've known for years that I have total control. I've never taken any advice on anything.\"[11][143] In 1996, Grant won substantial damages from News (UK) Ltd over what his lawyers called a \"highly defamatory\" article published in January 1995. The company's newspaper, Today, which ceased publication the following November, had falsely claimed that Grant verbally abused a young extra with a \"foul-mouthed tongue lashing\" on the set of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain.[161] On 27 April 2007, he accepted undisclosed damages from the Associated Newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles, which were published in the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday on 18, 21 and 24 February. His lawyer stated that all of the articles' \"allegations and factual assertions are false\".[162] Grant said, in a written statement, that he took the action because: \"I was tired of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain.\" He went on to take the opportunity to stress, \"I'm also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called 'close friends' or 'close sources' on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist.\"[163] On 27 June 1995, Grant was arrested in Los Angeles, California, in a police vice operation near Sunset Boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown.[164] He pleaded no contest and was fined $1,180, placed on two years' summary probation, and was ordered to complete an AIDS education program by Judge Robert J. Sandoval.[165][166] The arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of his first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week.[167] In the much-watched interview, he did not make excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, \"What the hell were you thinking?\"[168][169] Grant answered, \"I think you know in life what's a good thing to do and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And there you have it.\"[170] On Larry King Live, he declined host Larry King's repeated invitations to probe his psyche, saying that psychoanalysis was \"more of an American syndrome\" and he himself was \"a bit old fashioned\".[171] He told the host: \"I don't have excuses.\"[172] CNN reported that \"Many are also applauding Grant for his refreshing honesty in a culture that has become fed up with overuse of the word 'abuse,' but Grant did not resort to an excuse.\"[173] Radio host Scott Shannon said, \"He went ahead and faced the music and handled it with tongue [in] cheek.\"[173] In April 2007, he was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo Ian Whittaker.[174] Grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident.[175] Charges were dropped on 1 June 2007 by the Crown Prosecution Service on the grounds of \"insufficient evidence\".[176] In April 2011, Grant published an article in the New Statesman titled \"The Bugger, Bugged\"[13] about a conversation (following an earlier encounter) with Paul McMullan, a former journalist and paparazzo for News of the World. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the Daily Mail and News of the World, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"[13] When asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the Metropolitan Police to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"[13] Grant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.[14] Whilst the allegations regarding the News of the World continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered Millie Dowler had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's News Corporation, culminating in an appearance on BBC television's Question Time in July 2011.[15] Grant said: \"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world. I really needed that and also to be dealing with real life instead of creating synthetic life, which is what I've been doing for the last 25 years.\"[177] On 5 February 2018, Mirror Group Newspapers apologised for its actions towards Grant and other public figures, calling the affair \"morally wrong\". This came after Grant accepted a six-figure sum to settle a High Court action.[178][179] He donated the payout to the press campaign group Hacked Off.[180] In 1987, while playing Lord Byron in the Spanish production Remando Al Viento (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was cast in a supporting role as Byron's former lover Claire Clairmont.[63] He began dating Hurley during filming, and their relationship was subsequently the subject of much media attention.[181][182] After 13 years together, they separated in May 2000.[183] He is godfather to her son Damian, born in 2002.[184] Grant has had five children with two women. In September 2011, he had a daughter, Tabitha, with Tinglan Hong, who was sometimes misreported in the press as a receptionist at a Chinese restaurant in London.[185][186][187] His daughter's Chinese name is Xiao Xi, meaning \"happy surprise\".[188] Grant and Hong had a \"fleeting affair\", according to his publicist.[186] He has said that Hong has been \"badly treated\" by the media; the press intrusion prevented him from attending the birth of his daughter, with Hong obtaining an injunction to allow him to visit them in peace.[185] In September 2012, Grant had his second child, a son, with Swedish television producer Anna Eberstein. Hong and Grant reunited briefly and she gave birth to Grant's third child, a son, in December of that same year.[189][190] In December 2015 he and Eberstein had their second child, a girl.[191][192] In early 2018, their third child, Grant's fifth, was born. Grant and Eberstein married on 25 May 2018.[193] In 2011, Grant appeared at the Liberal Democrats' conference on the News International phone-hacking scandal, where he briefly met then-party leader Nick Clegg. Grant said that he was attending the Conservative and Labour conferences as well, but told Lib Dem activists that \"You, more than any of the other parties, have a good bill of health. You have never been in bed with these scumbags.\"[194] In the 2015 UK general election, Grant expressed support for Liberal Democrat MP Danny Alexander[195] and later hosted a dinner for the Liberal Democrats, in which he met the winner of a draw of donors to the Liberal Democrats.[196][197] In an email sent by former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, Grant wrote: \"I am not a Lib Dem, a Tory, a Labourite or anything in particular but I recognise political guts.\"[197] In the 2015 election, he endorsed two Labour candidates: Tom Watson[197] and his former agent, Michael Foster.[198] During the 2019 UK general election Grant campaigned for tactical voting to stop a Conservative majority and Brexit.[199] He was seen canvassing with Liberal Democrats candidates,[200] Labour candidates,[201][202] and independent Dominic Grieve.[203] As a young boy, he played rugby union on his school's first XV team at centre and also played football. He is a fan of Fulham and is also a supporter of Scottish football club Rangers. He continued to play in a Sunday-morning football league in south-west London after college and remains an \"impassioned Fulham supporter\".[33] His other interests include tennis[204] and snooker.[205] In 2011, the BBC apologised after Grant made an offhand joke about homosexuality and rugby when he was invited into the commentary box during coverage of an England vs Scotland game at Twickenham Stadium. Talking about playing rugby during his school days, Grant said: \"I discovered it hurt less if you tackled hard than if you tackled like a queen\".[206] After production on Restoration ended, Grant's co-star, Robert Downey Jr., revealed to Gayl Murphy on Hollywood Correspondent that he and Grant did not get along during filming. Downey went on to say that: \"I kinda think he's a jerk. Don't know, I just think he is. My personal experience with him is I think he's this kind of self-important, kind of, like, boring flash-in-the-pan a\u2014hole Brit.\" In 2018, Grant confirmed the on-set tension he and Downey had had, stating: \"He [Downey] hated me. He took one look at me and wanted to kill me. I was so hurt.\"[207] As a result of Grant's confirmation of their decades-long feud, Downey later went to Twitter to make amends with Grant, to which Grant agreed.[208] In addition to the confirmation, Grant also said that he and Drew Barrymore did not get along during production of Music & Lyrics. \"Well, Drew, I think did hate me a bit. But I admired her. We just were very different human beings\", Grant said. \"She was very L.A. and I was a grumpy Londoner. The funny thing is, although it was fractionally tense on the set of that film, I think the chemistry is rather good between us. Sometimes tension makes a good crackle.\"[207] Barrymore had also been one out of three leading ladies Grant listed whom he did not get along with, the others being Julianne Moore and Rachel Weisz.[209] However, on a Graham Norton Show appearance, Grant stated he did not know why he mentioned Weisz and he was probably \"going for a 'comedy triple'\".[210] There are several co-stars with whom Grant enjoyed working, some becoming great friends with him afterwards, such as Sandra Bullock.[209] He has also praised Meryl Streep, who co-starred with him on Florence Foster Jenkins, calling her \"a genius\", while only noting that she had trouble with her eyesight during production.[207] Other leading ladies he enjoyed working with include Emma Thompson, who collaborated with Grant on Love Actually, Impromptu, Sense and Sensibility, and The Remains of the Day. He also recalled having good experiences with Four Weddings and a Funeral co-star Andie Macdowell, whom he called a \"Southern peach charmer\", and Nine Months co-star Robin Williams, whom he called \"a genius on another level\" and \"very kind\".[207] Grant is a patron of the DIPEx Charity, which operates the website Healthtalkonline.[211][212][213] He is also patron of the Fynvola Foundation, named after his late mother; the foundation supports the Lady Dane Farmhouse, a home in Faversham for adults with learning disabilities.[214] Since the death of his mother in 2001, Grant has worked as a fundraiser and ambassador for Marie Curie Cancer Care, promoting the charity's annual Great Daffodil Appeal on several occasions.[215][216][217] He is also a patron of Pancreatic Cancer Action.[218][219]",

Grant has received a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, and an Honorary C\u00e9sar for his work. As of 2018[update], his films have grossed a total of nearly US$3\u00a0billion worldwide from 29\u00a0theatrical releases.[2] He first received attention after earning the Volpi Cup for his performance in the film Maurice (1987) but achieved international success after appearing in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994).[3] He used this breakthrough role as a frequent cinematic persona during the 1990s, delivering comic performances in  films such as Notting Hill (1999) and Mickey Blue Eyes (1999). For Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.\nGrant's starring role in the popular Four Weddings and a Funeral in 1994 made him one of the best known figures in 1990s' British popular culture, and he was seen as a charming, vulnerable, witty romantic lead. By the turn of the 21st century, he had established himself as a leading man, skilled with a satirical comic talent.[4] In the early 2000s he expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), Love Actually (2003), and American Dreamz (2006).[5] He later played against type with multiple roles in the epic sci-fi drama film, Cloud Atlas (2012). He is also known for appearing in period pieces such as The Remains of the Day (1993) and Sense and Sensibility (1995).  Most recently, he received critical acclaim for his portrayals of St. Clair Bayfield in Florence Foster Jenkins (2016); Phoenix Buchanan, an antagonist in Paddington 2 (2017);[6][7] and Jeremy Thorpe in the BBC One miniseries A Very English Scandal (2018).[8] He was BAFTA-nominated for all three performances, and received Golden Globe Award nominations for Florence Foster Jenkins and A Very English Scandal.\nWithin the film industry, Grant has been known as a meticulous performer and as an anti-star who approaches his roles like a character actor, working hard to make his acting appear spontaneous.[9] Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms. The entertainment media's coverage of his life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor.[10] He has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, his disdain towards the culture of celebrity, and his hostility towards the media.[11][12] He emerged as a prominent critic of the conduct of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation during the News International phone hacking scandal.[13][14][15] In a career spanning more than 35\u00a0years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling but rather a career that developed by happenstance.[16]\nGrant was born on 9 September 1960[17] at Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith, London, the second son of Fynvola Susan MacLean (b. Wickham, Hampshire, 11 October 1933; d. Hounslow, London, July 2001) and Captain James Murray Grant (b. 1929).[18] His grandfather, Colonel James Murray Grant, DSO was decorated for bravery and leadership at Saint-Valery-en-Caux during World War II.[19] Genealogist Antony Adolph has described Grant's family history as \"a colourful Anglo-Scottish tapestry of warriors, empire-builders and aristocracy\".[20] His ancestors include William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan, James Stewart,[20][21][22] John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Sir Evan Nepean, and a sister of former Prime Minister Spencer Perceval.[23]\nGrant's father was an officer in the Seaforth Highlanders for eight years in Malaya and  Germany.[24] He ran a carpet firm, pursued hobbies such as golf and painting watercolours, and raised his family in Chiswick, west London, where the Grants lived next to Arlington Park Mansions on Sutton Lane.[25][26] In September 2006, a collection of Capt. Grant's paintings was hosted by the John Martin Gallery in a charity exhibition, organised by his son, called \"James Grant: 30\u00a0Years of Watercolours\".[27] His mother worked as a schoolteacher and taught Latin, French and music for more than 30\u00a0years in the state schools of west London.[28] She died at the age of 67, 18 months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.[29]\nOn Inside the Actors Studio in 2002, he credited his mother with \"any acting genes that [he] might have\".[26] Both his parents were children of military families,[30] but, despite his parents' backgrounds, he has stated that his family was not always affluent while he was growing up.[31] He spent many of his childhood summers shooting and fishing with his grandfather in Scotland.[25] Grant has an older brother, James \"Jamie\" Grant, who is a New York-based investment banker.[25][32]\nGrant started his education at Hogarth Primary School in Chiswick but then moved to St Peter's Primary School in Hammersmith; he was then educated at an independent preparatory school, Wetherby School. From 1969 to 1978, he attended the independent Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith on a scholarship and played 1st XV rugby, cricket and football for the school.[33][34] He also represented Latymer on the quiz show, Top of the Form, an academic competition between two teams of four secondary school students each.[26]\nIn 1979, he won the Galsworthy scholarship to New College, Oxford. He studied English and graduated with 2:1 honours.[35] Viewing acting as nothing more than a creative outlet,[36] he joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and was Fabian in a production of Twelfth Night.[37][38] He also starred in his first film, Privileged (1982), produced by the Oxford University Film Foundation.  Actress Anna Chancellor, who met Grant while she was still at university, has recalled, \"I first met Hugh at a party at Oxford. There was something magical about him. He was a star even then, without having done anything.\"[39]\nHe received an offer from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London to pursue a PhD in the history of art, but decided not to take the offer because he failed to secure a grant.[40]\nAfter making his debut in the Oxford-financed film Privileged (1982), Grant dabbled in a variety of jobs, such as working as an assistant groundsman at Fulham Football Club,[41] tutoring, writing comedy sketches for TV shows,[42] and working for Talkback Productions to write and produce radio commercials for products such as Mighty White bread and Red Stripe lager.[43] At a screening of Privileged at BAFTA in London, he was approached by a talent agent offering to represent him. Still intending to begin his MPhil at the Courtauld Institute, Grant declined, but then later reconsidered, thinking that acting for a year would be a good way to save some money for his studies.[44]\nSoon afterwards he was offered a supporting role in The Bounty (1984) starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, but was prevented from playing the role because he didn't yet have an Equity card, which could only be earned through acting in regional theatre.[44] To obtain his Equity card, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse and lived for a year at Park Terrace in The Park Estate in Nottingham.[45] Richard Digby Day directed him in small roles at the Nottingham Playhouse in Lady Windermere's Fan, an avant-garde production of Hamlet, and Coriolanus.[46][47]\nBored with small acting parts, Grant created a sketch-comedy group called The Jockeys of Norfolk, a name taken from Shakespeare's Richard III, with friends Chris Lang and Andy Taylor. The group toured London's pub comedy circuit with stops at The George IV in Chiswick, Canal Cafe Theatre in Little Venice and The King's Head in Islington.[48] The Jockeys of Norfolk proved a hit at the 1985 Edinburgh Festival Fringe[49] after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on Russell Harty's BBC2 TV show Harty Goes to\u00a0....[50][51][52] In 1986 he played Eric Birling in a production of An Inspector Calls at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, directed by Richard Wilson,[53] giving a performance that Grevel Lindop, writing in the Times Literary Supplement, described as \"outstanding\".[54]\nIn 1985 and 1986, Grant had minor roles in eight television productions, including TV films, historical miniseries, and single episodes of series. His first leading film role came in Merchant-Ivory's Edwardian drama film Maurice (1987), adapted from E. M. Forster's novel.[55] He and co-star James Wilby shared the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for their portrayals of lovers Clive Durham and Maurice Hall, respectively.[56][57]\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, he balanced small roles on television with film work, which included playing Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere in the BAFTA Award-nominated White Mischief (1987),[58][59] and a supporting role in The Dawning (1988) opposite Anthony Hopkins and Jean Simmons.\nIn 1988 he had a leading role in Ken Russell's horror film, The Lair of the White Worm. He was Lord Byron in a Goya Award-winning Spanish production called Remando al viento (1988), and portrayed legendary champagne merchant Charles Heidsieck in the television film Champagne Charlie (1989). In 1990, he had a small role in the sport/crime drama The Big Man, opposite Liam Neeson, in which Grant assumed a Scottish accent; the film explores the life of a Scottish miner (Neeson) who becomes unemployed during a union strike. In 1991, he played Julie Andrews' gay son in the ABC made-for-television film Our Sons.[60]\nIn 1991 he starred as Frederic Chopin in Impromptu, opposite Judy Davis as his lover George Sand. Although his performance received little mention at the time, 25 years after the fact David Yearsley in CounterPunch wrote:\nIf an honest history about classical music on the big screen were to be written, the laurels for greatest performance would go to ... that loveable master of self-effacing charm, bumbling bonhomie, and buoyantly melancholic repartee, Hugh Grant ... [for] his definitive turn as Frederic Chopin .... Grant gave us a pale and haughty genius, seemingly self-assured yet painfully fragile beneath the fa\u00e7ade, and not just because of his hacking ill health. As the rigid yet passionate composer-pianist, Grant has never been funnier or truer.[61]\nIn 1992, he appeared in Roman Polanski's film Bitter Moon, portraying a fastidious and proper British tourist who is married, but finds himself enticed by the sexual hedonism of a seductive French woman and her embittered, paraplegic American husband. The film was called an \"anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty\" by the Washington Post.[62]  In 1993 he had a supporting role in the Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day. \nIn typical tongue-in-cheek style, Grant later jokingly called many of the productions of his early career  \"Europuddings, where you would have a French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they thought that was the way to sell it to America.\"[63]\nAt 32, Grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994).[4] \"If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you'd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny\", he later recalled.[3] Released in 1994 with Grant as the protagonist, Four Weddings and a Funeral became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244\u00a0million,[2] making him an overnight international star. \nThe film was nominated for two Academy Awards, and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew, it earned Grant a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also temporarily typecast him as the lead character, Charles, a bohemian and debonair bachelor. Grant saw it as an inside joke that the star, due to the parts he played, was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter (Richard Curtis), who is known for writing about himself and his own life.[63][64] Grant later expressed:\nAlthough I owe whatever success I've had to Four Weddings and a Funeral, it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions: One was that I was that character \u2013 when in fact nothing could be further from the truth, as I'm sure Richard would tell you \u2013 and the other frustrating thing was that they thought that's all I could do. I suppose, because those films happened to be successful, no one, perhaps understandably, ... bothered to rent all the other films I'd done.[4]\nIn July 1994, he signed a two-year production deal with Castle Rock Entertainment and by October, he became founder and director of the UK-based Simian Films Limited.[65] He appointed his then-girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley, as the head of development to look for prospective projects. Simian Films produced two Grant vehicles in the 1990s and lost a bid to produce About a Boy to Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions.[66] The company closed its US office in 2002 and Grant resigned as director in December 2005.[67]\nBefore the release of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant had reunited with its director Mike Newell for the tragicomedy An Awfully Big Adventure (1995), which was labelled a \"determinedly off-beat film\" by The New York Times.[68] He portrayed a bitchy, supercilious director of a repertory company in post-World War II Liverpool. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"It shows that he has range as an actor\",[69] but the San Francisco Chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film \"plays like a vanity production for Grant\".[70] Janet Maslin, praising Grant as \"superb\" and \"a dashing cad under any circumstances\", commented, \"For him this film represents the road not taken. Made before Four Weddings and a Funeral was released, it captures Mr. Grant as the clever, versatile character actor he was then becoming, rather than the international dreamboat he is today.\"[68] His next role was as a cartographer in 1917 Wales in The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain (1995).\n\nGrant's first studio-financed Hollywood project was opposite Julianne Moore in Chris Columbus's comedy Nine Months (1995). Though a hit at the box office, it was almost universally panned by critics. The Washington Post called it a \"grotesquely pandering caper\" and singled out Grant's performance, as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriend's unexpected pregnancy, for his \"insufferable muggings\".[71] Grant himself has been highly critical of his performance in Nine Months, stating in a 2016 interview: \"I really ruined it. And it was entirely my fault. I panicked, it was such a big jump up from what I'd been paid before to what they were offering me. And the scale was inhuman to my standards, you know the scale of the production, 20th Century Fox, the whole thing. And I just tried much too hard, and you know I forgot to do basic acting things, like mean it. So I pulled faces and overacted, it was a shocker.\"[44]\nNext in 1995, he starred as Emma Thompson's suitor in her Academy Award-winning adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, directed by Ang Lee. In 1995 he also performed in Restoration; Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote that Grant is \"having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter\",[72] and Kevin Thomas of Los Angeles Times said he has \"some delicious moments\" in the film.[73]\nHe made his debut as a film producer with the 1996 thriller Extreme Measures. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel each gave the film three out of four stars with Siskel writing \"Hugh Grant's work in Extreme Measures is a refreshing standout.\"[74]\nAfter a three-year hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for Four Weddings and a Funeral. This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363\u00a0million worldwide.[2] As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, \"Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds.\"[75] Reactions to his Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, \"Grant's performance stands as an emblem of what's wrong with Notting Hill. What's maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. He's become one of those actors who's all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly crow's feet to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out.\"[76] The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grant's turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with what the New York Times called \"a delightfully funny deadpan\".[77]\nGrant also released his second production output, a fish-out-of-water mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office, and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role. Roger Ebert thought, \"Hugh Grant is wrong for the role [and] strikes one wrong note and then another\",[78] whereas Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said, \"If he'd been on the Titanic, fewer lives would have been lost. If he'd accompanied Robert Scott to the South Pole, the explorer would have lived to be 100. That's how good Hugh Grant is at rescuing doomed ventures.\"[79]\nWhile promoting Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks (2000) on NBC's The Today Show in 2000, Grant told host Matt Lauer, \"It's my millennium of bastards\".[80] Small Time Crooks starred Grant, in the words of film critic Andrew Sarris, as \"a petty, petulant, faux-Pygmalion art dealer, David, [who] is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters Mr. Allen has ever created\".[81] In a role devoid of his comic attributes, the New York Times wrote: \"Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation.\"[82]\nIn 2000, Grant also joined the Supervisory Board of IM Internationalmedia AG, the powerful Munich-based film and media company.[83]\nIn 2001, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary was proclaimed by Variety to be \"as sly an overthrow of a star's polished posh \u2013 and nice \u2013 poster image as any comic turn in memory\".[84] The film, adapted from Helen Fielding's novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281\u00a0million worldwide.[2] He was, according to the Washington Post, fitting as \"a cruel, manipulative cad, hiding behind the male god's countenance that he knows all too well\".[85]\nIn 2002, Grant's \"immaculate comic performance\" (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics.[86] Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) was determined by the Washington Post to be \"that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings\".[87] Rolling Stone wrote, \"The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [and he] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs\",[88] while Roger Ebert observed that \"the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource\".[89] Released a day after the blockbuster Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones, About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129\u00a0million globally.[2] The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2002.[90] \"His performance can only be described as revelatory\", wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that \"Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness.\"[87] The New York Observer concluded: \"[The film] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance.\"[91] About a Boy also marked a notable change in his boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it \"looked good on him\".[92] He added that Grant's \"pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency.\"[92]\nHe was paired with Sandra Bullock in Warner Bros.'s Two Weeks Notice (2002), which made $199\u00a0million internationally but received poor reviews.[2] The Village Voice concluded that Grant's creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was \"little more than a Britishism machine\".[93]\nTwo Weeks Notice was followed by the 2003 ensemble comedy, Love Actually, headlined by Grant as the British Prime Minister. A Christmas release by Working Title Films, the film was promoted as \"the ultimate romantic comedy\" and accumulated $246\u00a0million at the international box office.[2] It marked the directorial debut of Richard Curtis, who told the New York Times that Grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier Curtis incarnations.[94] Roger Ebert claimed that \"Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian\" and has \"so much self-confidence that he plays the British prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport\".[95] Film critic Rex Reed, on the contrary, called his performance \"an oversexed bachelor spin on Tony Blair\" as the star \"flirted with himself in the paroxysm of self-love that has become his acting style\".[96]\nIn 2004, he reprised his role as Daniel Cleaver for a small part in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, which, like its predecessor, made more than $262\u00a0million commercially.[2]\nGone from the screen for two years, Grant next re-teamed with Paul Weitz (About a Boy) for the black comedy American Dreamz (2006). Grant starred as the acerbic host of an American Idol-like reality show where, according to Caryn James of the New York Times, \"nothing is real ... except the black hole at the centre of the host's heart, as Mr. Grant takes Mr. Cowell's villainous act to its limit\".[97] American Dreamz failed financially but Grant was generously praised. He played his self-aggrandising character, an amalgam of Simon Cowell and Ryan Seacrest, with smarmy self-loathing. The Boston Globe proposed that this \"just may be the great comic role that has always eluded Hugh Grant\",[98] and critic Carina Chocano said, \"He is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy.\"[99]\nIn 2007, he starred opposite Drew Barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as \"a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough\".[100] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs,[30] Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!.[11] The film, with its revenues totalling $145\u00a0million, allowed him to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame.\"[101]\nIn 2009, he starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy Did You Hear About the Morgans?, which was a critical failure but was a box office success.[102]\nGrant was featured in the Wachowskis' and Tom Tykwer's epic science fiction film Cloud Atlas in 2012, playing six different dark characters.[103]. In the same year, Grant lent his voice to the Aardman stop motion animation The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!.[104] He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film The Rewrite (2014), starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant's performance was praised by many critics;[105][106] director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favourites of the year and called Grant a \"perfect leading man\".[107] In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E.;[108] Entertainment Weekly described his performance as \"the only bit of fun\" in the film,[109] and Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that \"while it can't be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably\".[110]\nIn 2016, Grant played St. Clair Bayfield, partner of the title character, in the film Florence Foster Jenkins, directed by Stephen Frears and starring Meryl Streep. His performance drew raves from film critics as \"career-best\" (Screen International), \"one of his best performances in years\" (Indiewire), \"best work of his career\" (Variety) where he \"goes deeper, darker and riskier\" (Rolling Stone).[111][112][113][114] Rafer Guzman of Newsday said \"Surely the 55-year-old actor has just sealed his first-ever Oscar nomination.\"[115] Carrie Rickey of Yahoo! Movies commented that Grant \"deserves the Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the recognition \u2014 finally \u2014 that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors\".[116] He was nominated for his first individual Screen Actors Guild Award and also earned nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Critics' Choice Award, a Satellite Award and a European Film Award. Several critics put his work among the best acting performances of the year.[117][118] Most award pundits predicted Grant would receive his first Academy Award nomination for his performance but he was not nominated.[119][120][121]\nHis next appearance was as Phoenix Buchanan, a villain in the family film Paddington 2,[122] which was a commercial and critical success. The Guardian described his performance as \"scene-stealing\",[123] while IGN commented \"Grant continues to make an astonishing comeback in his career, once again by playing into his expert comedic abilities as Phoenix Buchanan, who dons each of his ridiculous disguises with a kind of egotistical obliviousness that Grant is perfect at pulling off.\"[124] Grant went on to win London Film Critics' Circle Award for Supporting Actor of the Year and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. Grant's performance was ranked as the 22nd greatest movie performance of the decade by IndieWire in 2019.[125]\nIn 2018, Grant returned to television screens after 25 years, as Jeremy Thorpe in the BBC One miniseries A Very English Scandal, which marked his second collaboration with director Stephen Frears.[126] The miniseries, and in particular Grant, were widely and highly praised. Digital Spy's review stated that \"There's always been a bit of the devil in Grant's best turns, and in Thorpe, a man with a fully-realised dark side, he's found his richest part in years\".[127] The New Statesman wrote \"Hugh Grant is Thorpe, and everything about his performance is exactly so. It's the role of Grant's life, and he performs it even more brilliantly than he did Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2.\"[128] The Sunday Times stated \"It's become tediously predictable to praise this drama but, as Thorpe, Hugh Grant really has proved he's getting better as he's getting older\".[129] The Guardian called him \"utterly captivating\",[130] and the Boston Globe wrote \"Grant is a revelation\".[131] The New Yorker stated \"Hugh Grant gives a brilliant performance as Thorpe, whose arrogance, charm, and profoundly evasive nature he captures with subtlety. A quarter century after Grant established himself as everyone's crush with his romantic-comedy d\u00e9but, in Four Weddings and a Funeral ... the actor, who is now in his late fifties, has turned out to have a gift for conveying what happens to an individual when charm curdles into something considerably darker.\"[132] Grant was nominated for several awards for his performance, including Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.[133]\nIn 2019, Grant played another against-type role, in Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen, his second collaboration with the director following The Man From U.N.C.L.E.[134] Grant plays Fletcher, a seedy and unscrupulous tabloid reporter, which he called \"a fun bit of casting\" referring to his Hacked Off campaigning. He has stated he based his character on reporters who \"used to be my enemies and now they\u2019re my friends\".[135] Even though the film received mostly mixed reviews,[136] Grant's performance was praised. Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter called Grant \"a beating comic heart\" of the film, adding that \"he weighs up every wry line with relish, and Ritchie makes strong use of his deadpan comic talents.\"[137] Joe Morgenstern of Wall Street Journal also highly praised his work, writing, \"[I]n a word, Mr. Grant is sensational. In two more words, he's absolutely hilarious; it's some of the best work he's done on screen.\"[138]\nGrant has predominantly been a comedy (especially a romantic comedy) actor for almost all of his mainstream film career. While some film critics, such as Roger Ebert, have defended the limited variety of his performances, others have dismissed him as a one-trick pony. Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a long-time collaborator, said, \"His range hasn't been fully tested, but each performance is unique.\"[139] Many of Grant's films in the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, he was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously.[45] These performances were sometimes deemed excessive, in the words of Washington Post's Rita Kempley, due to his \"comic overreactions\u2014the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids\". She added: \"He's got more tics than Benny Hill.\"[140] His penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, he must get \"his jiving and shucking under control\".[141] Film historian David Thomson opined in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film that Grant equated merely \"itchy mannerisms\" with screen acting.[142] On his choice of roles, Grant has said:\nI've never been tempted to do the part where I cry or get AIDS or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews. I genuinely believe that comedy acting, light comedy acting, is as hard as, if not harder than serious acting, and it genuinely doesn't bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by knee-jerk reaction go to the deepest, darkest, most serious performances and parts. It makes me laugh.[143]\nGrant's screen persona in his films of the 2000s gradually developed into a cynical, self-loathing cad.[144] Claudia Puig of USA Today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally \"gone [were] the self-conscious 'Aren't I adorable' mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of his film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies\".[145] According to Carina Chocano, amongst film critics, the two tropes most commonly associated with Grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in Bridget Jones's Diary and About a Boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself.[146]\nNonetheless, Grant has occasionally acted in dramas. He played a sleazy, snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film An Awfully Big Adventure, which received critical praise, and for \"a very quiet, dignified\" performance as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin in James Lapine's biopic film Impromptu.[147][148] In 2012, he played six \"incredibly evil\" characters in the epic drama film Cloud Atlas, an experience he has spoken about positively. Grant said:\nI do a lot of killing and raping [in the film]... But it was a laugh. I thought before I read it that I'd turn it down, which I normally do, but I was interested in meeting [Cloud Atlas co-directors] the Wachowskis because I have always admired them enormously. And they are so charming and fascinating.... I slightly called my own bluff. In one of the parts I am a cannibal, about 2,000 years in the future, and I thought, \"I can do that. It's easy.\" And then I am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in Germany and they are saying, \"You know, hungry! We must have that flesh-eating, like a leopard who is so hungry\", and I am thinking, \"I can't do that! Just give me a witty line!\"[149]\nGrant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press[150] and is known in the media for his guarded privacy.[151] On probing of his personal life, he has remained steadfast in \"offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough\".[152] He has described himself as a reluctant actor, has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be \"a phase\" in his life, lasting no more than ten years.[63][153]\nA 2007 Vogue profile referred to him as a man with a \"professionally misanthropic mystique\".[11] He has expressed distaste for focus groups, market research, and emphasis on opening weekend box-office numbers, saying: \"It's so destructive to the filmmaking process. What was wrong with the way they used to release films, more slowly, let them build?\"[154] The director Mike Newell has said: \"There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him that's gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy.\"[155] Filmmaker Paul Weitz said that Grant is funny and that \"he perceives flaws in himself and other people, and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless\".[156] British newspapers regularly refer to him as \"grumpy\".[157]\nGrant is a self-confessed \"committed and passionate\" perfectionist on a film set.[16] The American film critic Dave Kehr has written that Grant \"is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role \u2013 someone who works hard to make it look easy \u2013 though that isn't a trait he admires in himself\".[9] He is noted by co-workers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard.[11][158][159]\nHe dropped his agent in 2006, ending a 10-year relationship with CAA.[160] He has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career: \"They've known for years that I have total control. I've never taken any advice on anything.\"[11][143]\nIn 1996, Grant won substantial damages from News (UK) Ltd over what his lawyers called a \"highly defamatory\" article published in January 1995. The company's newspaper, Today, which ceased publication the following November, had falsely claimed that Grant verbally abused a young extra with a \"foul-mouthed tongue lashing\" on the set of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain.[161]\nOn 27 April 2007, he accepted undisclosed damages from the Associated Newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles, which were published in the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday on 18, 21 and 24 February. His lawyer stated that all of the articles' \"allegations and factual assertions are false\".[162] Grant said, in a written statement, that he took the action because: \"I was tired of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain.\" He went on to take the opportunity to stress, \"I'm also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called 'close friends' or 'close sources' on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist.\"[163]\nOn 27 June 1995, Grant was arrested in Los Angeles, California, in a police vice operation near Sunset Boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown.[164] He pleaded no contest and was fined $1,180, placed on two years' summary probation, and was ordered to complete an AIDS education program by Judge Robert J. Sandoval.[165][166]\nThe arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of his first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week.[167] In the much-watched interview, he did not make excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, \"What the hell were you thinking?\"[168][169] Grant answered, \"I think you know in life what's a good thing to do and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And there you have it.\"[170]\nOn Larry King Live, he declined host Larry King's repeated invitations to probe his psyche, saying that psychoanalysis was \"more of an American syndrome\" and he himself was \"a bit old fashioned\".[171] He told the host: \"I don't have excuses.\"[172] CNN reported that \"Many are also applauding Grant for his refreshing honesty in a culture that has become fed up with overuse of the word 'abuse,' but Grant did not resort to an excuse.\"[173] Radio host Scott Shannon said, \"He went ahead and faced the music and handled it with tongue [in] cheek.\"[173]\nIn April 2007, he was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo Ian Whittaker.[174] Grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident.[175] Charges were dropped on 1 June 2007 by the Crown Prosecution Service on the grounds of \"insufficient evidence\".[176]\nIn April 2011, Grant published an article in the New Statesman titled \"The Bugger, Bugged\"[13] about a conversation (following an earlier encounter) with Paul McMullan, a former journalist and paparazzo for News of the World. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the Daily Mail and News of the World, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"[13]\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the Metropolitan Police to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"[13]\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.[14]\nWhilst the allegations regarding the News of the World continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered Millie Dowler had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's News Corporation, culminating in an appearance on BBC television's Question Time in July 2011.[15]\nGrant said: \"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world. I really needed that and also to be dealing with real life instead of creating synthetic life, which is what I've been doing for the last 25 years.\"[177]\nOn 5 February 2018, Mirror Group Newspapers apologised for its actions towards Grant and other public figures, calling the affair \"morally wrong\". This came after Grant accepted a six-figure sum to settle a High Court action.[178][179] He donated the payout to the press campaign group Hacked Off.[180]\nIn 1987, while playing Lord Byron in the Spanish production Remando Al Viento (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was cast in a supporting role as Byron's former lover Claire Clairmont.[63] He began dating Hurley during filming, and their relationship was subsequently the subject of much media attention.[181][182] After 13 years together, they separated in May 2000.[183] He is godfather to her son Damian, born in 2002.[184]\nGrant has had five children with two women. In September 2011, he had a daughter, Tabitha, with Tinglan Hong, who was sometimes misreported in the press as a receptionist at a Chinese restaurant in London.[185][186][187] His daughter's Chinese name is Xiao Xi, meaning \"happy surprise\".[188] Grant and Hong had a \"fleeting affair\", according to his publicist.[186] He has said that Hong has been \"badly treated\" by the media; the press intrusion prevented him from attending the birth of his daughter, with Hong obtaining an injunction to allow him to visit them in peace.[185]\nIn September 2012, Grant had his second child, a son, with Swedish television producer Anna Eberstein. Hong and Grant reunited briefly and she gave birth to Grant's third child, a son, in December of that same year.[189][190]\nIn December 2015 he and Eberstein had their second child, a girl.[191][192] In early 2018, their third child, Grant's fifth, was born.\nGrant and Eberstein married on 25 May 2018.[193]\nIn 2011, Grant appeared at the Liberal Democrats' conference on the News International phone-hacking scandal, where he briefly met then-party leader Nick Clegg. Grant said that he was attending the Conservative and Labour conferences as well, but told Lib Dem activists that \"You, more than any of the other parties, have a good bill of health. You have never been in bed with these scumbags.\"[194]\nIn the 2015 UK general election, Grant expressed support for Liberal Democrat MP Danny Alexander[195] and later hosted a dinner for the Liberal Democrats, in which he met the winner of a draw of donors to the Liberal Democrats.[196][197] In an email sent by former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, Grant wrote: \"I am not a Lib Dem, a Tory, a Labourite or anything in particular but I recognise political guts.\"[197] In the 2015 election, he endorsed two Labour candidates: Tom Watson[197] and his former agent, Michael Foster.[198]\nDuring the 2019 UK general election Grant campaigned for tactical voting to stop a Conservative majority and Brexit.[199] He was seen canvassing with Liberal Democrats candidates,[200] Labour candidates,[201][202] and independent Dominic Grieve.[203]\nAs a young boy, he played rugby union on his school's first XV team at centre and also played football. He is a fan of Fulham and is also a supporter of Scottish football club Rangers. He continued to play in a Sunday-morning football league in south-west London after college and remains an \"impassioned Fulham supporter\".[33] His other interests include tennis[204] and snooker.[205]\nIn 2011, the BBC apologised after Grant made an offhand joke about homosexuality and rugby when he was invited into the commentary box during coverage of an England vs Scotland game at Twickenham Stadium. Talking about playing rugby during his school days, Grant said: \"I discovered it hurt less if you tackled hard than if you tackled like a queen\".[206]\nAfter production on Restoration ended, Grant's co-star, Robert Downey Jr., revealed to Gayl Murphy on Hollywood Correspondent that he and Grant did not get along during filming. Downey went on to say that: \"I kinda think he's a jerk. Don't know, I just think he is. My personal experience with him is I think he's this kind of self-important, kind of, like, boring flash-in-the-pan a\u2014hole Brit.\" In 2018, Grant confirmed the on-set tension he and Downey had had, stating: \"He [Downey] hated me. He took one look at me and wanted to kill me. I was so hurt.\"[207] As a result of Grant's confirmation of their decades-long feud, Downey later went to Twitter to make amends with Grant, to which Grant agreed.[208]\nIn addition to the confirmation, Grant also said that he and Drew Barrymore did not get along during production of Music &amp; Lyrics. \"Well, Drew, I think did hate me a bit. But I admired her. We just were very different human beings\", Grant said. \"She was very L.A. and I was a grumpy Londoner. The funny thing is, although it was fractionally tense on the set of that film, I think the chemistry is rather good between us. Sometimes tension makes a good crackle.\"[207] Barrymore had also been one out of three leading ladies Grant listed whom he did not get along with, the others being Julianne Moore and Rachel Weisz.[209] However, on a Graham Norton Show appearance, Grant stated he did not know why he mentioned Weisz and he was probably \"going for a 'comedy triple'\".[210]\nThere are several co-stars with whom Grant enjoyed working, some becoming great friends with him afterwards, such as Sandra Bullock.[209] He has also praised Meryl Streep, who co-starred with him on Florence Foster Jenkins, calling her \"a genius\", while only noting that she had trouble with her eyesight during production.[207] Other leading ladies he enjoyed working with include Emma Thompson, who collaborated with Grant on Love Actually, Impromptu, Sense and Sensibility, and The Remains of the Day. He also recalled having good experiences with Four Weddings and a Funeral co-star Andie Macdowell, whom he called a \"Southern peach charmer\", and Nine Months co-star Robin Williams, whom he called \"a genius on another level\" and \"very kind\".[207]\nGrant is a patron of the DIPEx Charity, which operates the website Healthtalkonline.[211][212][213] He is also patron of the Fynvola Foundation, named after his late mother; the foundation supports the Lady Dane Farmhouse, a home in Faversham for adults with learning disabilities.[214]\nSince the death of his mother in 2001, Grant has worked as a fundraiser and ambassador for Marie Curie Cancer Care, promoting the charity's annual Great Daffodil Appeal on several occasions.[215][216][217] He is also a patron of Pancreatic Cancer Action.[218][219]\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJeffrey Preston Bezos (/\u02c8be\u026azo\u028as/;[a][3] n\u00e9 Jorgensen; born January 12, 1964) is an American internet and aerospace entrepreneur, media proprietor, and investor. He is best known as the founder, chief executive officer, and president of Amazon. The first centi-billionaire on the Forbes wealth index, Bezos was named the \"richest man in modern history\" after his net worth increased to $150\u00a0billion in July 2018.[4] In September 2018, Forbes described him as \"far richer than anyone else on the planet\" as he added $1.8\u00a0billion to his net worth when Amazon became the second company in history to reach a market cap of $1\u00a0trillion. Bezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and raised in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. He founded the online retailer Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest internet company by revenue, as well as the world's largest provider of AI assistance[5] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services arm. Bezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. A Blue Origin test flight successfully first reached space in 2015, and the company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[6] Bezos also purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for US$250\u00a0million in cash and manages many other investments through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions. Bezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, the son of Jacklyn (Gise) Jorgensen and Ted Jorgensen.[7] At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student, and his father was a bike shop owner.[8] After Jacklyn divorced Ted, she married Cuban immigrant Miguel \"Mike\" Bezos in April 1968.[9] Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.[10] The family moved to Houston, Texas, where Mike worked as an engineer for Exxon after he received a degree from the University of New Mexico.[11] Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[12] Bezos' maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[13] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[11] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117\u00a0ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406\u00a0ha).[14][15] His maternal grandmother was Mattie Louise Gise (n\u00e9e Strait), through whom he is a cousin of country singer George Strait.[16] Bezos often displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency; he once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[17][18] The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.[19][20] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[21] He attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[22][23] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[22] In the graduation speech Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when the people of earth would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention \"to get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.\"[24] In 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 grade point average and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[25][26] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.[27][28] After Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others.[29] He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade.[30] Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter.[31] He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust; he worked there from 1988 to 1990.[31] He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly founded hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling, in 1990 and worked there until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president at the age of 30.[31][29] In late 1993, Bezos decided to establish an online bookstore.[32] He left his job at D.\u00a0E. Shaw and founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle.[33][34] Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[35] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents and invested in Amazon.[34] He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[36] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[31][35] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[37] In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.[35] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video; by the end of the year, he had also expanded the company's products to include a variety of consumer goods.[35] Bezos used the $54\u00a0million raised during the company's 1997 equity offering to finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[35] In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2\u00a0billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350\u00a0million.[38] In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic.[35] In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[39] After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[38] In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400\u00a0million.[40] In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle.[41] According to a 2008 Time profile, Bezos wished to create the same flow state found in video game simulations in books; he wished readers would fully engage with books.[42] In 2013, Bezos secured a $600\u00a0million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[43] In October that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[44] In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671\u00a0million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[45] On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7\u00a0million.[46] A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[47] By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109\u00a0billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin.[48] On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial.[49] On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2\u00a0billion.[50] Due to the growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon into India.[51] On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became the world's wealthiest person over Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated net worth increased to just over $90\u00a0billion. His wealth surpassed $100\u00a0billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by Forbes on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[52] In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5\u00a0billion to localize operations throughout the company's supply chain routes.[53] Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon\u2013and Bezos, specifically\u2013of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal routes, and anti-competitive business practices.[54] Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos' personal wealth by $10.7\u00a0billion.[55] Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out of Stanford University indicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[56] During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon's face recognition software, Rekognition.[57] Additionally, statements by the Trump administration, in favor of overturning the antitrust law known as the Paramount Decree, have been predicted to help Amazon acquire the Landmark Theaters chain.[58] Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receiving corporate welfare.[59] This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied on food stamps.[60] While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: \"Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?\"[61] He later said: \"Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America.\"[62] Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary \"misleading\" as it included part-time workers.[63] However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[64] On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[65] The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour \u2013 a decision that was interpreted as support for the Fight for $15 movement.[66] In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup company.[67] Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the solar system.[23] He was the valedictorian when he graduated from high school in 1982. His speech was followed up with a Miami Herald interview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[68] The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.[69] After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006, when it purchased a large tract of land in West Texas for a launch and test facility.[70] After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[71] In September 2011, one of the company's unmanned prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancing spaceflight.[72] In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[73] He has been compared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[74] In 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[75] Later in November, Blue Origin's New Shepard space vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[76] He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated with business-related pollution.[77] In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[78] To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[79] Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes to colonize the solar system, and has been selling $1\u00a0billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[80][81] In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve the natural resources of Earth by making the human species multi-planetary.[82] He announced that New Shepard would begin transporting humans into sub-orbital space by November 2018.[82] In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[83] On August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of The Washington Post for $250\u00a0million in cash.[84] To execute the sale, he established Nash Holdings, a limited liability holding company that legally owns the paper.[85] The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control.[86] In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at The Washington Post and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii, and Minnesota.[87] In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the newspaper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software.[88] Throughout the early years of ownership, Bezos was accused of having a potential conflict of interest with the paper.[89] Bezos and the newspaper's editorial board have dismissed accusations that he unfairly controlled the paper's content and Bezos maintains the paper's independence.[90][91] After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos made the purchase in 2013.[91] Bezos makes personal investments through his venture capital vehicle, Bezos Expeditions.[92] He was one of the first shareholders in Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3\u00a0million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1\u00a0billion in 2017.[93][94] He also invested in Unity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[95] Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology, Grail, Juno Therapeutics, and ZocDoc.[96] In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos' role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later named Haven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.[97][98] Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[99] Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics at Princeton Neuroscience Institute.[100][101] In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of two Saturn V first-stage Rocketdyne F-1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[102] They were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission's S-1C stage from July 1969.[103][104] The engine is currently on display at the Seattle Museum of Flight.[105][106] Journalist Nellie Bowles of The New York Times has described the public persona and personality of Bezos as that of \"a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan\".[107] During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense of public charity and social welfare.[107][108] His business practices projected a public image of prudence and parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. Bezos was a multi-billionaire who hung his clothes on a rack in his Amazon headquarters office and drove a 1996 Honda Accord.[109] Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[110][111][112] Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[113][114] This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman who described him as \"talking in lists\" and \"[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made.\"[110] Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrote an unauthorized book that described Bezos as a demanding boss as well as hyper-competitive.[108][113] Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles and externalities.[115][116] During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to wear tailored clothing; he weight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[117] His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as the metonym of the company.[118][119] His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has been parodied as an enterprising super villain.[120][121][122] Since 2017, he has been portrayed by Kyle Mooney and Steve Carell on Saturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[123] Bezos eats exotic foods, such as octopus and roasted iguana.[124][125][126] In May 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation named Bezos the \"World's Worst Boss\", with its general secretary Sharan Burrow saying: \"Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model.\"[127] During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[14] His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[128][14] Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing a New York Times piece.[129][130] Bezos has stated \"it is always Day 1\" to describe his growth mindset.[131][132] Bezos used what he called a \"regret-minimization framework\" while he worked at D.\u00a0E. Shaw and again during the early years of Amazon.[133] He described this life philosophy by stating: \"When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes.\"[133] During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[134] To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the mantra \"Get Big Fast\", which spoke to the company's need to scale its operations and establish market dominance.[35] He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of dividends.[110] Bezos uses the term \"work\u2013life harmony\" instead of the more standard work\u2013life balance because he believes balance implies that you can have one and not the other.[135] He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[135] Journalist Walt Mossberg dubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting, \"The Bezos Principle\".[136] Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule\u2013a preference for meetings to be small enough to where two pizzas can feed everyone in the board room.[137] When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise the common standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[138] He meets with Amazon investors for a total of only six hours a year.[137] Instead of using PowerPoints, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[139] Starting in 1998, Bezos publishes an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers not competitors, take risks for market leadership, facilitate staff morale, build a company culture, and empower people.[140][141] Bezos maintains the email address \"jeff@amazon.com\" as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company.[142] Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[142] Bezos has cited Warren Buffett (of Berkshire Hathaway), Jamie Dimon (of JPMorgan Chase), and Bob Iger (of Walt Disney) as major influences on his leadership style.[143] Bezos first became a millionaire in 1997 after raising $54\u00a0million through Amazon's initial public offering (IPO).[157] He was first included on the Forbes World's Billionaires list in 1999 with a registered net worth of $10.1\u00a0billion.[158] His net worth decreased to $6.1\u00a0billion a year later, a 40.5% drop.[159] His wealth plummeted even more the following year, dropping 66.6% to $2.0\u00a0billion.[160] He lost $500\u00a0million the following year, which brought his net worth down to $1.5\u00a0billion.[161] The following year, his net worth increased by 104% to $2.5\u00a0billion.[162] From 2005 to 2007, he quadrupled his net worth to $8.7\u00a0billion.[163] After the financial crisis and succeeding economic recession, his net worth would erode to $6.8\u00a0billion\u2014a 17.7% drop.[164][165] His wealth rose by 85.2% in 2010, leaving him with $12.6\u00a0billion. This percentage increase ascended him to the 43rd spot on the ranking from 68th.[164][166] After a rumor broke out that Amazon was developing a smartphone, Bezos' net worth rose to $30.5\u00a0billion in 2014.[167][168] A year later, Bezos entered the top ten when he increased his net worth to a total of $50.3\u00a0billion.[169] Bezos rose to be the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7\u00a0billion in one hour.[169] By the time the Forbes list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2\u00a0billion.[170] However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2\u00a0billion to $66.5\u00a0billion unofficially ranking him the third richest person in the world behind Warren Buffett.[171] After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.[172] Bezos would continue to sporadically surpass Gates throughout the month of October 2017 after Amazon's share price fluctuated.[173] His net worth surpassed $100\u00a0billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, after Amazon's share price increased by more than 2.5%.[174] When the 2017 list was issued, Bezos' net worth was registered at $72.8\u00a0billion, adding $27.6\u00a0billion from the previous year.[175] Bezos was officially ranked as the third wealthiest person in the world up from the 5th spot in 2016.[175] His wealth's rapid growth from 2016 to 2017 sparked a variety of assessments about how much money Bezos earned on a controlled, reduced time scale. On October 10, 2017, he made an estimated $6.24\u00a0billion in 5 minutes, slightly less than the annual Gross Domestic Product of Kyrgyzstan.[176] On March 6, 2018, Bezos was officially designated the wealthiest person in the world with a registered net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[177] He unseated Bill Gates ($90\u00a0billion) who was $6\u00a0billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84\u00a0billion), ranked third.[178] He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).[c] His wealth, in 2017\u201318 terms, equaled that of 2.7\u00a0million Americans.[184] Bezos' net worth increased by $33.6\u00a0billion from January 2017 to January 2018. This increase outstripped the economic development (in GDP terms) of more than 96 countries around the world.[185] During March 9, Bezos earned $230,000 every 60 seconds.[186] The Motley Fool estimated that if Bezos had not sold any of his shares from its original public offering in 1997, his net worth would sit at $181\u00a0billion in 2018.[187] According to Quartz, his net worth of $150\u00a0billion in July 2018 was enough to purchase the entire stock markets of Nigeria, Hungary, Egypt, Luxembourg, and Iran.[188] Following the report by Quartz, Amazon workers in Poland, (Germany), and Spain participated in demonstrations and labor strikes to draw attention to his growing wealth and the lack of compensation, labor rights, and satisfactory working conditions of select Amazon workers.[189] On July 17, 2018 he was designated the \"wealthiest person in modern history\"[d] by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,[192] Fortune,[193] MarketWatch,[194] The Wall Street Journal,[195] and Forbes.[191] In 2019, Bezos's wealth was reduced by his divorce with his wife MacKenzie Bezos.[196] According to Forbes, had the Washington state common law applied to their divorce without a prenuptial agreement, Bezos' wealth could have been equitably divided with his ex-wife,[197][198] however she eventually received 25% of Bezos's Amazon shares, valued at approximately $36\u00a0billion, making her the third richest woman in the world. Bezos retained his interest in The Washington Post and Blue Origin, as well as voting control of the shares received by his ex-wife.[199] In June 2019, Bezos purchased three adjoining apartments overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan, including a penthouse, for a combined total of US$80\u00a0million, making this one of the most expensive real estate purchases within New York City in 2019.[200] In 1992, Bezos was working for D. E. Shaw in Manhattan when he met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm; the couple married a year later.[31][201] In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon.[202] He and his ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons, and one daughter adopted from China.[69][203] In March 2003, Bezos was one of three passengers in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas after the craft's tail boom hit a tree.[204] Bezos sustained minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.[26] In 2016, Bezos played a Starfleet official in the movie Star Trek Beyond, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening.[205] He had lobbied Paramount for the role and apropos of Alexa and his personal/professional interest in speech recognition his one line consisted of a response to an alien in distress: \"Speak Normally.\" In his initial discussion of the project which became Alexa with his technical advisor Greg Hart in 2011, Bezos told him that the goal was to create \"the Star Trek computer.\" [206] On January 9, 2019, Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, announced on Twitter their intent to divorce after a \"long period\" of separation.[207][208][209] On April 4, 2019, the divorce was finalized, with Bezos keeping 75% of the couple's Amazon stock and MacKenzie getting the remaining 25% ($35.6\u00a0billion) in Amazon stock. However, Bezos would keep all of the couple's voting rights.[210] On February 7, 2019, Bezos published an online essay in which he accused American Media, Inc. owner David Pecker of \"extortion and blackmail\" for threatening to publish intimate photos of Bezos and Lauren S\u00e1nchez, if he did not stop his investigation into how his text messages and other photos had been leaked to the National Enquirer.[211][212] According to public campaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns of Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, two Democratic U.S. senators from Washington. He has also supported U.S. representative John Conyers, as well as Patrick Leahy and Spencer Abraham, U.S. senators serving on committees dealing with Internet-related issues.[213] Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, and in 2012 contributed $2.5\u00a0million to Washington United for Marriage, a group supporting a yes vote on Washington Referendum 74, which affirmed a same-sex marriage law enacted in the state.[214] Bezos donated $100,000 towards a movement against a Washington state income tax in 2010 for \"top earners.\" [213] In 2012, he donated to Amazon's political action committee (PAC),[213] which has given $56,000 and $74,500 to Democrats and Republicans, respectively.[215] After the 2016 presidential election, Bezos was invited to join Donald Trump's Defense Innovation Advisory Board, an advisory council to improve the technology used by the Defense Department. Bezos declined the offer without further comment.[43][216] Trump has repeatedly attacked Bezos via Twitter, accused Bezos of avoiding corporate taxes, gaining undue political influence, and undermining his presidency by spreading \"fake news.\"[217][218] Bezos has repeatedly joked about using his rocket company to send Donald Trump into outer space.[219][220] In 2014, Amazon won a bid for a cloud computing contract with the CIA valued at $600\u00a0million.[221] A 2018, $10\u00a0billion contract known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project, this time with the Pentagon, was allegedly written up in a way that favors Amazon.[222] Controversy over this was raised when General James Mattis accepted a headquarters tour invitation from Bezos and co-ordinated the deal through Sally Donnelly, a lobbyist who previously worked for Amazon.[223] In November 2019, when the contract was awarded to Microsoft instead, Amazon filed a lawsuit with allegations that the bidding process was biased.[224][225] Despite Bezos' support for an open borders policy towards immigrants, Amazon has actively marketed facial recognition software to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[226] In 2019, a political action committee linked to Bezos spent over $1\u00a0million in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat activist Kshama Sawant in Seattle's city council election.[227] In March 2018, Bezos met in Seattle with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[228] In March 2019, Bezos' security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Bezos' phone. According to BBC, Bezos' top security staffer, Gavin de Becker, \"linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\" Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at the Washington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey\u2019s Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[229] On January 2020, The Guardian reported that hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in the Washington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos' mobile phone conducted by advisory firm FTI Consulting, concluded it \"highly probable\" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in a WhatsApp message to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on 1 May 2018.[230][231] Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[232] Bezos donated to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center several times between 2009 and 2017.[233] In 2013, he pledged $500,000 to Worldreader, a non-profit founded by a former Amazon employee.[234] In September 2018, Business Insider reported that Bezos was the only one of the top five billionaires in the world who had not signed the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that encourage wealthy people to give away their wealth.[235] That same month, philanthropy expert Janet Camarena, director of transparency initiatives at Foundation Center, was quoted by CNBC as having questions about Bezos\u2019 new fund, including the fund's structure and how exactly it will be funded.[236] On May 23, 2017, Bezos gave $1\u00a0million to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides pro bono legal services for American journalists.[237] On June 15, 2017, he posted a message on Twitter asking for ideas for philanthropy: \"I'm thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time\u2014working on the long term\".[14] At the time of the post, Bezos' lifetime spending on charitable causes was estimated to be $100\u00a0million.[14] Multiple journalists responded by asking Bezos to pay higher wages to Amazon warehouse workers.[238][239] A year later in June, he tweeted that he would announce two philanthropic foci by the end of summer 2018.[240] Bezos announced in September 2018 that he would commit approximately $2\u00a0billion to a fund to deal with American homelessness and establish a network of non-profit preschools for low income communities.[241] As part of this announcement, he committed to establishing the \"Day 1 Families Fund\" to finance \"night shelters and day care centers for homeless families\" and the \"Day 1 Academies Fund\" for early childhood education.[242][243] In January 2018, Bezos made a $33\u00a0million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors.[244] In June 2018, Bezos donated to Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private philanthropic fund founded by Bill Gates aimed at promoting emissions-free energy.[245] In September 2018, Bezos donated $10\u00a0million to With Honor, a nonpartisan organization that works to increase the number of veterans in political office.[246]",

He is best known as the founder, chief executive officer, and president of Amazon. The first centi-billionaire on the Forbes wealth index, Bezos was named the \"richest man in modern history\" after his net worth increased to $150\u00a0billion in July 2018.[4] In September 2018, Forbes described him as \"far richer than anyone else on the planet\" as he added $1.8\u00a0billion to his net worth when Amazon became the second company in history to reach a market cap of $1\u00a0trillion.\nBezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and raised in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. He founded the online retailer Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest internet company by revenue, as well as the world's largest provider of AI assistance[5] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services arm.\nBezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. A Blue Origin test flight successfully first reached space in 2015, and the company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[6] Bezos also purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for US$250\u00a0million in cash and manages many other investments through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions.\nBezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, the son of Jacklyn (Gise) Jorgensen and Ted Jorgensen.[7] At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student, and his father was a bike shop owner.[8] After Jacklyn divorced Ted, she married Cuban immigrant Miguel \"Mike\" Bezos in April 1968.[9] Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.[10] The family moved to Houston, Texas, where Mike worked as an engineer for Exxon after he received a degree from the University of New Mexico.[11] Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[12]\nBezos' maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.[13] Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend many summers in his youth.[11] Bezos would later purchase this ranch and expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117\u00a0ha) to 300,000 acres (121,406\u00a0ha).[14][15] His maternal grandmother was Mattie Louise Gise (n\u00e9e Strait), through whom he is a cousin of country singer George Strait.[16] Bezos often displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency; he once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.[17][18]\nThe family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School.[19][20] While Bezos was in high school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.[21] He attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[22][23] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[22] In the graduation speech Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when the people of earth would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention \"to get all people off the Earth and see it turned into a huge national park.\"[24]\nIn 1986, he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a 4.2 grade point average and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in electrical engineering and computer science; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[25][26] In addition, he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.[27][28]\nAfter Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others.[29] He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade.[30] Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter.[31] He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust; he worked there from 1988 to 1990.[31] He then joined D. E. Shaw &amp; Co, a newly founded hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling, in 1990 and worked there until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president at the age of 30.[31][29]\n\nIn late 1993, Bezos decided to establish an online bookstore.[32] He left his job at D.\u00a0E. Shaw and founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle.[33][34] Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra  but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[35] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents and invested in Amazon.[34] He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[36] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[31][35] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[37] In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble.[35] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video; by the end of the year, he had also expanded the company's products to include a variety of consumer goods.[35] Bezos used the $54\u00a0million raised during the company's 1997 equity offering to finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[35] In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2\u00a0billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350\u00a0million.[38] In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic.[35] In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[39] After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[38] In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400\u00a0million.[40] In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle.[41] According to a 2008 Time profile, Bezos wished to create the same flow state found in video game simulations in books; he wished readers would fully engage with books.[42] In 2013, Bezos secured a $600\u00a0million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[43] In October that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[44]\nIn May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671\u00a0million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[45] On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7\u00a0million.[46] A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[47] By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109\u00a0billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin.[48] On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial.[49] On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2\u00a0billion.[50] Due to the growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon into India.[51] On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became the world's wealthiest person over Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated net worth increased to just over $90\u00a0billion. His wealth surpassed $100\u00a0billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by Forbes on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[52]\nIn March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5\u00a0billion to localize operations throughout the company's supply chain routes.[53] Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon\u2013and Bezos, specifically\u2013of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal routes, and anti-competitive business practices.[54] Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos' personal wealth by $10.7\u00a0billion.[55] Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out of Stanford University indicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[56] During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon's face recognition software, Rekognition.[57] Additionally, statements by the Trump administration, in favor of overturning the antitrust law known as the Paramount Decree, have been predicted to help Amazon acquire the Landmark Theaters chain.[58]\nCriticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receiving corporate welfare.[59] This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied on food stamps.[60] While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: \"Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?\"[61] He later said: \"Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America.\"[62] Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary \"misleading\" as it included part-time workers.[63] However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[64] On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[65] The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour \u2013 a decision that was interpreted as support for the Fight for $15 movement.[66]\nIn September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup company.[67] Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the solar system.[23] He was the valedictorian when he graduated from high school in 1982. His speech was followed up with a Miami Herald interview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[68] The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.[69]\nAfter its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006, when it purchased a large tract of land in West Texas for a launch and test facility.[70] After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[71] In September 2011, one of the company's unmanned prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancing spaceflight.[72] In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[73] He has been compared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[74]\nIn 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[75] Later in November, Blue Origin's New Shepard space vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[76] He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated with business-related pollution.[77]\nIn December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[78] To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[79] Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes to colonize the solar system, and has been selling $1\u00a0billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[80][81] In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve the natural resources of Earth by making the human species multi-planetary.[82] He announced that New Shepard would begin transporting humans into sub-orbital space by November 2018.[82] In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[83]\nOn August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of The Washington Post for $250\u00a0million in cash.[84] To execute the sale, he established Nash Holdings, a limited liability holding company that legally owns the paper.[85] The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control.[86] In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at The Washington Post and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii, and Minnesota.[87] In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the newspaper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software.[88] Throughout the early years of ownership, Bezos was accused of having a potential conflict of interest with the paper.[89] Bezos and the newspaper's editorial board have dismissed accusations that he unfairly controlled the paper's content and Bezos maintains the paper's independence.[90][91] After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos made the purchase in 2013.[91]\nBezos makes personal investments through his venture capital vehicle, Bezos Expeditions.[92] He was one of the first shareholders in Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3\u00a0million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1\u00a0billion in 2017.[93][94] He also invested in Unity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[95] Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology, Grail, Juno Therapeutics, and ZocDoc.[96] In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos' role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later named Haven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.[97][98]\nBezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[99] Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics at Princeton Neuroscience Institute.[100][101] In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of two Saturn V first-stage Rocketdyne F-1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[102] They were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission's S-1C stage from July 1969.[103][104] The engine is currently on display at the Seattle Museum of Flight.[105][106]\nJournalist Nellie Bowles of The New York Times has described the public persona and personality of Bezos as that of \"a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan\".[107] During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense of public charity and social welfare.[107][108] His business practices projected a public image of prudence and parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. Bezos was a multi-billionaire who hung his clothes on a rack in his Amazon headquarters office and drove a 1996 Honda Accord.[109] Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[110][111][112]\nBezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[113][114] This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman who described him as \"talking in lists\" and \"[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made.\"[110] Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrote an unauthorized book that described Bezos as a demanding boss as well as hyper-competitive.[108][113] Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles and externalities.[115][116]\nDuring the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to wear tailored clothing; he weight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[117] His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as the metonym of the company.[118][119] His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has been parodied as an enterprising super villain.[120][121][122] Since 2017, he has been portrayed by Kyle Mooney and Steve Carell on Saturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[123] Bezos eats exotic foods, such as octopus and roasted iguana.[124][125][126] In May 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation named Bezos the \"World's Worst Boss\", with its general secretary Sharan Burrow saying: \"Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model.\"[127] During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[14] His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[128][14] Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing a New York Times piece.[129][130]\nBezos has stated \"it is always Day 1\" to describe his growth mindset.[131][132]\nBezos used what he called a \"regret-minimization framework\" while he worked at D.\u00a0E. Shaw and again during the early years of Amazon.[133] He described this life philosophy by stating: \"When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes.\"[133] During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[134] To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the mantra \"Get Big Fast\", which spoke to the company's need to scale its operations and establish market dominance.[35] He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of dividends.[110]\nBezos uses the term \"work\u2013life harmony\" instead of the more standard work\u2013life balance because he believes balance implies that you can have one and not the other.[135] He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[135] Journalist Walt Mossberg dubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting, \"The Bezos Principle\".[136] Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule\u2013a preference for meetings to be small enough to where two pizzas can feed everyone in the board room.[137] When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise the common standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[138]\nHe meets with Amazon investors for a total of only six hours a year.[137] Instead of using PowerPoints, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[139] Starting in 1998, Bezos publishes an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers not competitors, take risks for market leadership, facilitate staff morale, build a company culture, and empower people.[140][141] Bezos maintains the email address \"jeff@amazon.com\" as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company.[142] Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[142] Bezos has cited Warren Buffett (of Berkshire Hathaway), Jamie Dimon (of JPMorgan Chase), and Bob Iger (of Walt Disney) as major influences on his leadership style.[143]\nBezos first became a millionaire in 1997 after raising $54\u00a0million through Amazon's initial public offering (IPO).[157] He was first included on the Forbes World's Billionaires list in 1999 with a registered net worth of $10.1\u00a0billion.[158] His net worth decreased to $6.1\u00a0billion a year later, a 40.5% drop.[159] His wealth plummeted even more the following year, dropping 66.6% to $2.0\u00a0billion.[160] He lost $500\u00a0million the following year, which brought his net worth down to $1.5\u00a0billion.[161] The following year, his net worth increased by 104% to $2.5\u00a0billion.[162] From 2005 to 2007, he quadrupled his net worth to $8.7\u00a0billion.[163] After the financial crisis and succeeding economic recession, his net worth would erode to $6.8\u00a0billion\u2014a 17.7% drop.[164][165] His wealth rose by 85.2% in 2010, leaving him with $12.6\u00a0billion. This percentage increase ascended him to the 43rd spot on the ranking from 68th.[164][166]\nAfter a rumor broke out that Amazon was developing a smartphone, Bezos' net worth rose to $30.5\u00a0billion in 2014.[167][168] A year later, Bezos entered the top ten when he increased his net worth to a total of $50.3\u00a0billion.[169] Bezos rose to be the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7\u00a0billion in one hour.[169] By the time the Forbes list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2\u00a0billion.[170] However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2\u00a0billion to $66.5\u00a0billion unofficially ranking him the third richest person in the world behind Warren Buffett.[171] After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.[172]\nBezos would continue to sporadically surpass Gates throughout the month of October 2017 after Amazon's share price fluctuated.[173] His net worth surpassed $100\u00a0billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, after Amazon's share price increased by more than 2.5%.[174] When the 2017 list was issued, Bezos' net worth was registered at $72.8\u00a0billion, adding $27.6\u00a0billion from the previous year.[175] Bezos was officially ranked as the third wealthiest person in the world up from the 5th spot in 2016.[175] His wealth's rapid growth from 2016 to 2017 sparked a variety of assessments about how much money Bezos earned on a controlled, reduced time scale. On October 10, 2017, he made an estimated $6.24\u00a0billion in 5 minutes, slightly less than the annual Gross Domestic Product of Kyrgyzstan.[176]\nOn March 6, 2018, Bezos was officially designated the wealthiest person in the world with a registered net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[177] He unseated Bill Gates ($90\u00a0billion) who was $6\u00a0billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84\u00a0billion), ranked third.[178] He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).[c]\nHis wealth, in 2017\u201318 terms, equaled that of 2.7\u00a0million Americans.[184] Bezos' net worth increased by $33.6\u00a0billion from January 2017 to January 2018. This increase outstripped the economic development (in GDP terms) of more than 96 countries around the world.[185] During March 9, Bezos earned $230,000 every 60 seconds.[186] The Motley Fool estimated that if Bezos had not sold any of his shares from its original public offering in 1997, his net worth would sit at $181\u00a0billion in 2018.[187] According to Quartz, his net worth of $150\u00a0billion in July 2018 was enough to purchase the entire stock markets of Nigeria, Hungary, Egypt, Luxembourg, and Iran.[188] Following the report by Quartz, Amazon workers in Poland, (Germany), and Spain participated in demonstrations and labor strikes to draw attention to his growing wealth and the lack of compensation, labor rights, and satisfactory working conditions of select Amazon workers.[189] On July 17, 2018 he was designated the \"wealthiest person in modern history\"[d] by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,[192] Fortune,[193] MarketWatch,[194] The Wall Street Journal,[195] and Forbes.[191]\nIn 2019, Bezos's wealth was reduced by his divorce with his wife MacKenzie Bezos.[196] According to Forbes, had the Washington state common law applied to their divorce without a prenuptial agreement, Bezos' wealth could have been equitably divided with his ex-wife,[197][198] however she eventually received 25% of Bezos's Amazon shares, valued at approximately $36\u00a0billion, making her the third richest woman in the world. Bezos retained his interest in The Washington Post and Blue Origin, as well as voting control of the shares received by his ex-wife.[199]\nIn June 2019, Bezos purchased three adjoining apartments overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan, including a penthouse, for a combined total of US$80\u00a0million, making this one of the most expensive real estate purchases within New York City in 2019.[200]\nIn 1992, Bezos was working for D. E. Shaw in Manhattan when he met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm; the couple married a year later.[31][201] In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon.[202] He and his ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons, and one daughter adopted from China.[69][203]\nIn March 2003, Bezos was one of three passengers in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas after the craft's tail boom hit a tree.[204] Bezos sustained minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.[26]\nIn 2016, Bezos played a Starfleet official in the movie Star Trek Beyond, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening.[205] He had lobbied Paramount for the role and apropos of Alexa and his personal/professional interest in speech recognition his one line consisted of a response to an alien in distress:  \"Speak Normally.\"  In his initial discussion of the project which became Alexa with his technical advisor Greg Hart in 2011, Bezos told him that the goal was to create \"the Star Trek computer.\" [206]\nOn January 9, 2019, Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, announced on Twitter their intent to divorce after a \"long period\" of separation.[207][208][209] On April 4, 2019, the divorce was finalized, with Bezos keeping 75% of the couple's Amazon stock and MacKenzie getting the remaining 25% ($35.6\u00a0billion) in Amazon stock. However, Bezos would keep all of the couple's voting rights.[210]\nOn February 7, 2019, Bezos published an online essay in which he accused American Media, Inc. owner David Pecker of \"extortion and blackmail\" for threatening to publish intimate photos of Bezos and Lauren S\u00e1nchez, if he did not stop his investigation into how his text messages and other photos had been leaked to the National Enquirer.[211][212]\nAccording to public campaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns of Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, two Democratic U.S. senators from Washington. He has also supported U.S. representative John Conyers, as well as Patrick Leahy and Spencer Abraham, U.S. senators serving on committees dealing with Internet-related issues.[213] Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, and in 2012 contributed $2.5\u00a0million to Washington United for Marriage, a group supporting a yes vote on Washington Referendum 74, which affirmed a same-sex marriage law enacted in the state.[214] Bezos donated $100,000 towards a movement against a Washington state income tax in 2010 for \"top earners.\" [213] In 2012, he donated to Amazon's political action committee (PAC),[213] which has given $56,000 and $74,500 to Democrats and Republicans, respectively.[215]\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, Bezos was invited to join Donald Trump's Defense Innovation Advisory Board, an advisory council to improve the technology used by the Defense Department. Bezos declined the offer without further comment.[43][216] Trump has repeatedly attacked Bezos via Twitter, accused Bezos of avoiding corporate taxes, gaining undue political influence, and undermining his presidency by spreading \"fake news.\"[217][218] Bezos has repeatedly joked about using his rocket company to send Donald Trump into outer space.[219][220]\nIn 2014, Amazon won a bid for a cloud computing contract with the CIA valued at $600\u00a0million.[221] A 2018, $10\u00a0billion contract known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project, this time with the Pentagon, was allegedly written up in a way that favors Amazon.[222] Controversy over this was raised when General James Mattis accepted a headquarters tour invitation from Bezos and co-ordinated the deal through Sally Donnelly, a lobbyist who previously worked for Amazon.[223] In November 2019, when the contract was awarded to Microsoft instead, Amazon filed a lawsuit with allegations that the bidding process was biased.[224][225] Despite Bezos' support for an open borders policy towards immigrants, Amazon has actively marketed facial recognition software to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[226]\nIn 2019, a political action committee linked to Bezos spent over $1\u00a0million in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat activist Kshama Sawant in Seattle's city council election.[227]\nIn March 2018, Bezos met in Seattle with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[228] In March 2019, Bezos' security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Bezos' phone. According to BBC, Bezos' top security staffer, Gavin de Becker, \"linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\" Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at the Washington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey\u2019s Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[229]\nOn January 2020, The Guardian reported that hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in the Washington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos' mobile phone conducted by advisory firm FTI Consulting, concluded it \"highly probable\" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in a WhatsApp message to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on 1 May 2018.[230][231] Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[232]\nBezos donated to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center several times between 2009 and 2017.[233] In 2013, he pledged $500,000 to Worldreader, a non-profit founded by a former Amazon employee.[234]\nIn September 2018, Business Insider reported that Bezos was the only one of the top five billionaires in the world who had not signed the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that encourage wealthy people to give away their wealth.[235] That same month, philanthropy expert Janet Camarena, director of transparency initiatives at Foundation Center, was quoted by CNBC as having questions about Bezos\u2019 new fund, including the fund's structure and how exactly it will be funded.[236]\nOn May 23, 2017, Bezos gave $1\u00a0million to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides pro bono legal services for American journalists.[237] On June 15, 2017, he posted a message on Twitter asking for ideas for philanthropy: \"I'm thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time\u2014working on the long term\".[14] At the time of the post, Bezos' lifetime spending on charitable causes was estimated to be $100\u00a0million.[14] Multiple journalists responded by asking Bezos to pay higher wages to Amazon warehouse workers.[238][239] A year later in June, he tweeted that he would announce two philanthropic foci by the end of summer 2018.[240] Bezos announced in September 2018 that he would commit approximately $2\u00a0billion to a fund to deal with American homelessness and establish a network of non-profit preschools for low income communities.[241] As part of this announcement, he committed to establishing the \"Day 1 Families Fund\" to finance \"night shelters and day care centers for homeless families\" and the \"Day 1 Academies Fund\" for early childhood education.[242][243]\nIn January 2018, Bezos made a $33\u00a0million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors.[244] In June 2018, Bezos donated to Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private philanthropic fund founded by Bill Gates aimed at promoting emissions-free energy.[245] In September 2018, Bezos donated $10\u00a0million to With Honor, a nonpartisan organization that works to increase the number of veterans in political office.[246]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nAmber Laura Heard (born April 22, 1986)[3] is an American actress and model. Born and raised in Texas, she made her film debut in a minor supporting role in the sports drama Friday Night Lights (2004), followed by a series of other small roles in television and film. Her first leading role was in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), but it was not released in the United States until 2013 due to distribution problems. Her second major role came in the short-running The CW television series Hidden Palms (2007). Heard's breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in the action film Never Back Down and in the stoner comedy Pineapple Express, which were both box office successes. The same year, she received the Breakthrough Award at Young Hollywood Awards. Heard continued her career with roles in films such as The Informers (2008), The Stepfather (2009), Zombieland (2009), and The Joneses (2009). In 2011, she played the female lead opposite Nicolas Cage in Drive Angry, and opposite Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary; neither were critically nor commercially successful. Subsequently, Heard appeared in 3 Days to Kill (2014), Magic Mike XXL (2015) and The Danish Girl (2015). She also starred in the indie film The Adderall Diaries (2015), the television musical drama One More Time (2015), and the Martin Amis adaptation London Fields (2018). The latter was due to be released in 2015, but became the subject of a series of lawsuit between its director, Heard, and the film's production company over disagreements in its editing and other issues. The film was finally released in 2018, and was both a critical and commercial flop. In 2017, Heard acted as part of an ensemble cast\u00a0in the indie film I Do...Until I Don't (2017) and made an appearance as Mera in the superhero film Justice League (2017). She reprised the latter role opposite Jason Momoa\u00a0in Aquaman (2018), which became the most profitable DC Extended Universe film up to that point, and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.[4] The same year, Heard was also named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al Paris. In 2019, she appeared in supporting roles in the independent films Her Smell and Gully. In addition to her acting career, Heard engages in activism for causes such as LGBTQ rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness. She is an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador and has been named a Human Rights Champion for the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. From 2015 to 2017, Heard was married to her The Rum Diary co-star Johnny Depp. Their divorce drew significant media attention as Heard alleged that Depp had been physically and verbally abusive towards her through most of their relationship. In 2019, he sued her for defamation after she discussed being a victim of domestic violence in the media. He claimed that Heard had in fact abused him; Heard denies this and has repeated her allegations. Heard was born in Austin, Texas, to Patricia Paige (n\u00e9e Parsons), an internet researcher, and David Clinton Heard, who owned a small construction company.[5][3][6] She has a younger sister named Whitney.[3][7] The family lived outside Austin.[8] Heard's father broke horses in his freetime, and she grew up riding horses, hunting, and fishing with him.[8] She also participated in beauty pageants, although as an adult she has stated that she could no longer \"support the objectification\".[8] When Heard was 16, her best friend died in a car crash. Heard, who was raised Catholic, subsequently declared herself an atheist.[9] Around the same time, she began reading books by writers such as Ayn Rand, Ray Bradbury,\u00a0and George Orwell, and began questioning society around her.[5] At the age of 17, she no longer felt comfortable in Texas[8] and dropped out of her Catholic high school to move to New York City.[6][5] She eventually earned a diploma through a home-study course.[9] In NYC, she supported herself through modeling,[6] but soon moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.[8] Heard's earliest acting work included appearances in two music videos, Kenny Chesney's \"There Goes My Life\" and Eisley's \"I Wasn't Prepared\", and small supporting roles in the television series Jack & Bobby (2004), The Mountain (2004), and The O.C. (2005). She made her film debut in a minor role in the sports drama Friday Night Lights (2004), followed by small supporting roles in films such as Drop Dead Sexy (2005), North Country (2005), Side FX (2005), Price to Pay (2006), You Are Here (2006), and Alpha Dog (2006), and guest starring spot in an episode of the police procedural Criminal Minds. Heard's first starring role was playing the main character's love interest in The CW's teen drama Hidden Palms, which the network wanted to replace summer reruns of other series aimed for teenage audiences. The series premiered in the United States on May 30, 2007 to mixed to negative reviews. It was also unpopular with audiences, leading the CW to air only eight of the planned 12 episodes before canceling it.[10][11] The same year, Heard also appeared in the short movie Day 73 with Sarah,[12] the critically panned teen drama Remember the Daze, and an episode of the Showtime series Californication.[13] Heard gained more mainstream recognition in 2008, when she appeared in supporting roles in the Judd Apatow-produced stoner comedy Pineapple Express[14] and the martial arts drama Never Back Down, both of which were box office successes. That year, she won a Breakthrough Award at the Hollywood Film Festival. Her other 2008 film releases were the critically panned Bret Easton Ellis adaptation The Informers, in which she was part of an ensemble cast,[15] and All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, an unconventional slasher film in which she had one of her first leading roles. Its director, Jonathan Levine, said he had chosen Heard for the title role because \"there was a certain type of beauty and a certain type of innate intelligence that Amber brought to it that is not something you find every day. Certainly, not something you would find in somebody her age. The wisdom she projects I thought was pretty remarkable.\"[16] Mandy Lane had already premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, and had been initially picked for distribution by Harvey Weinstein.[17][18] After a negative test screening, Weinstein dropped the film, and it was then released in the United Kingdom in 2008 by a different distributing company.[19] It did not have a theatrical release in the United States until 2013. The Los Angeles Times stated that Heard gave her most \"definitive [performance] to date [2013]\" in the film,[20] and The Washington Post wrote that she gave a \"psychologically interesting performance\".[21] In 2009, Heard had roles in the critically panned horror film The Stepfather and in three comedies, the limited-release indie ExTerminators, the critically and commercially successful Zombieland, and the box office disappointment The Joneses. Although she otherwise received relatively little attention from established critics due to her roles being mainly supporting at this point, Variety wrote that \"she steals the show\" from the film's more established star, Demi Moore, in The Joneses.[22] The following year, Heard starred in the indie drama The River Why and continued her work in the horror genre in John Carpenter's The Ward, which was a critical and commercial disappointment. Carpenter has later stated that he was disappointed in the film but \"loved working with Amber and would work with her again without hesitation.\"[23] She also co-produced and starred in the independent thriller And Soon the Darkness.[24] Heard's next role was as the female lead opposite Johnny Depp in the Hunter S. Thompson adaptation The Rum Diary (2011), which received mixed reviews[25][26] and was not a commercial success.[27][28] Heard's other 2011 film release was Drive Angry, a supernatural action thriller in which she was paired with Nicolas Cage.[29] Although the film was critically panned[30] and underperformed commercially,[31] film critic Roger Ebert wrote that she \"does everything that can possibly be done\" with her character, a waitress who becomes entangled in an undead man's mission to save his daughter from a cult.[32] In February 2011, Heard also appeared on the British television program Top Gear.[33] Heard appeared in no new films until 2013, when she starred in the thriller Paranoia, the action-comedy Machete Kills, and the satirical drama Syrup. All three were critical and box office failures. Her only film release in 2014, the action-thriller 3 Days to Kill, was a box office success but panned by critics. Heard had prominent roles in four films released in 2015, which led James Mottram of the British newspaper The Independent to call it a \"watershed year\" in her career.[34] In the comedy-drama Magic Mike XXL she played a photographer who flirts with Channing Tatum's protagonist; like its predecessor, Magic Mike (2012), the film was a large box office success.[35] Digital Spy described Heard as \"a convincing girl-next-door type\".[36] Heard also had a small supporting role as a ballet dancer in Tom Hooper's critically successful historical drama The Danish Girl (2015), which premiered at the 72nd Venice Film Festival.[37][38] In her third 2015 release, the independent crime thriller The Adderall Diaries, she starred opposite James Franco, Christian Slater, and Ed Harris. Indiewire gave the film a mixed review and stated that Heard was \"miscast\" but \"displays much potential and has succeeded in a bid to be taken more seriously.\"[39] Her fourth role in 2015 was opposite Christopher Walken in the television film One More Time, which aired on Starz. For her role as a struggling singer-songwriter, she took singing lessons and learned to play piano and guitar.[40] International Business Times described Heard as \"talented enough to share a few heartfelt moments in a character that mostly operates on the defensive.\"[41] The Los Angeles Times called her performance \"superb\" and The Film Stage stated that Heard did an \"admirable job\".[42][43] In addition to her other roles in 2015, Heard played the female lead in the Martin Amis adaptation London Fields, which was initially scheduled to premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.[44] It was pulled from the festival roster after director Mathew Cullen sued the film's producers, accusing them of fraud and of using his name to promote a cut of the film he did not support.[45] The film's stars, including Heard, had also written to the producers, objecting to the cut that was seen at press and industry screenings in Toronto.[46] London Fields and Heard's performance received highly negative reviews,[47][48][49] and she stated that \"it was one of the most difficult movies to film and it has proven to continue to be difficult...I can't say I did her [the character] justice.\"[34] In November 2016, Heard was sued by the film's producers for $10 million, claiming that she and Cullen made unauthorized changes to the film's script and failed to finish voice-over work.[50][51][52] Heard countersued claiming the producers violated a nudity clause in her contract.[53] In September 2018, a settlement was reached,[54] and London Fields was released, becoming a box office failure and earning Heard a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.[55][56] In 2017, Heard appeared as part of an ensemble cast in Lake Bell's indie comedy I Do... Until I Don't and joined the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) cast as Mera, Aquaman's Atlantean queen, in the superhero film Justice League. She reprised the role the following year in Aquaman (2018), which co-starred Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe and marked Heard's first major role in a studio film.[7][57][58] She has stated that one of the reasons attracting her to the part was Mera being \"a strong, independent, self-possessed superhero in her own right\",[7] who rejects being called Aquawoman instead of by her own name.[8] Aquaman became the fifth most profitable release of 2018, and the most profitable DCEU installment up to that point.[59] The same year, Heard was appointed global ambassador for cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al Paris.[8] In 2019, Heard played supporting roles in the independent dramas Her Smell and Gully. Her upcoming projects include the CBS All Access miniseries The Stand, based on Stephen King's eponymous novel and co-starring James Marsden, Odessa Young\u00a0and Henry Zaga.[60] Heard has raised awareness about domestic and sexual violence. Together with actors Gabourey Sidibe and Freida Pinto, she read a speech on behalf of sexual assault victim Emily Doe at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards in 2016; Doe was the recipient of an award.[61] Heard also made a public service announcement about domestic violence for the #GirlGaze Project,[62] and has written about her experiences of domestic violence in the December 2016 issue of Porter magazine[63] and in an op-ed for The Washington Post in December 2018.[64] She has been an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador for women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence since December 2018,[65][66] and has also been named a Human Rights Champion for the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.[67] In May 2019, she gave a speech in support of the SHIELD Act\u00a0on Capitol Hill, discussing her experience of having had her private nude photos hacked and distributed online without her consent during the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos in 2014.[68] On November 4, 2019, The New York Times published an op-ed written by Heard on the subject.[69] In a 2008 interview, Heard stated that she is agnostic.[70] She is fluent in American Sign Language and Spanish.[71] Heard publicly came out at GLAAD's 25th anniversary event in 2010,[72] but has stated, \"I don't label myself one way or another\u2014I have had successful relationships with men and now a woman. I love who I love; it's the person that matters.\"[73] Of her decision to come out, she said: \"I think when I became aware of my role in the media, I had to ask myself an important question 'Am I part of the problem?' And I think that when millions and millions of hard-working, taxpaying Americans are denied their rights and denied their equality you have to ask yourself what are the factors that are an epidemic problem and that's what this is.\"[72] Heard was in a relationship with photographer Tasya van Ree from 2008 to 2012.[72][74] In 2014, Heard was one of the victims of the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos, in which her private nude photos were hacked and distributed without her consent.[69] Heard met actor Johnny Depp while filming The Rum Diary in 2011, and they began living together the following year.[74][75] They were married in a private civil ceremony at their home in Los Angeles on February 3, 2015.[75][76] In April 2015, Heard and Depp breached Australia's biosecurity laws when they failed to declare their two Yorkshire terriers to the Australian Customs Service when they flew by private jet into Queensland, where he was working on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.[77][78] Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation.[79] She was placed on a $1,000 one-month good behavior bond for producing a false document;[80] Heard and Depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the biosecurity laws.[80] The Guardian called the case the \"highest profile criminal quarantine case\" in Australian history.[80] Heard filed for divorce from Depp on May 23, 2016, and obtained a temporary restraining order against him, stating in her court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.[81][82][83][84] In response, Depp's lawyers alleged that she was \"attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.\"[81][85] Heard testified about the abuse under oath at a divorce court deposition.[84] Evidence of the alleged abuse from her court filings was also published in the media.[85][81] A settlement was reached on August 16, 2016,[86] and the divorce was finalized in January 2017.[87] Heard dismissed the restraining order, and the former couple issued a joint statement saying that their \"relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.\"[86] Depp paid Heard a settlement of US$7\u00a0million, which she donated to the ACLU and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.[86][88][89] Following the divorce, Heard dated tech entrepreneur Elon Musk for several months, until early 2018.[7] In early 2019, Depp sued Heard for US$50 million for defamation over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in December 2018, which \"depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her,\"[90][91] despite it not mentioning Depp or any of the alleged incidences of violence perpetrated by him.[84] Depp also alleged that Heard had been the abuser, and that her allegations constituted a hoax against him.[91] In response, Heard said that Depp's claims are not true and repeated her allegations and evidence, maintaining that Depp was abusive towards her.[84] Her lawyer further stated that Depp is attempting to \"gaslight the world\"[92] and \"silence\" her.[93] She asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit\u2014which Depp filed in Virginia, where the Post is located\u2014so that the case could be tried in California (where most of the witnesses reside), but this request was denied.[94][95][96]",

Born and raised in Texas, she made her film debut in a minor supporting role in the sports drama Friday Night Lights (2004), followed by a series of other small roles in television and film. Her first leading role was in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), but it was not released in the United States until 2013 due to distribution problems. Her second major role came in the short-running The CW television series Hidden Palms (2007).\nHeard's breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in the action film Never Back Down and in the stoner comedy Pineapple Express, which were both box office successes. The same year, she received the Breakthrough Award at Young Hollywood Awards. Heard continued her career with roles in films such as The Informers (2008), The Stepfather (2009), Zombieland (2009), and The Joneses (2009). In 2011, she played the female lead opposite Nicolas Cage in Drive Angry, and opposite Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary; neither were critically nor commercially successful. Subsequently, Heard appeared in 3 Days to Kill (2014), Magic Mike XXL (2015) and The Danish Girl (2015). She also starred in the indie film The Adderall Diaries (2015), the television musical drama One More Time (2015), and the Martin Amis adaptation London Fields (2018). The latter was due to be released in 2015, but became the subject of a series of lawsuit between its director, Heard, and the film's production company over disagreements in its editing and other issues. The film was finally released in 2018, and was both a critical and commercial flop.\nIn 2017, Heard acted as part of an ensemble cast\u00a0in the indie film I Do...Until I Don't (2017) and made an appearance as Mera in the superhero film Justice League (2017). She reprised the latter role opposite Jason Momoa\u00a0in Aquaman (2018), which became the most profitable DC Extended Universe film up to that point, and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.[4] The same year, Heard was also named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al Paris. In 2019, she appeared in supporting roles in the independent films Her Smell and Gully.\nIn addition to her acting career, Heard engages in activism for causes such as LGBTQ rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness. She is an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador and has been named a Human Rights Champion for the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. From 2015 to 2017, Heard was married to her The Rum Diary co-star Johnny Depp. Their divorce drew significant media attention as Heard alleged that Depp had been physically and verbally abusive towards her through most of their relationship. In 2019, he sued her for defamation after she discussed being a victim of domestic violence in the media. He claimed that Heard had in fact abused him; Heard denies this and has repeated her allegations.\nHeard was born in Austin, Texas, to Patricia Paige (n\u00e9e Parsons), an internet researcher, and David Clinton Heard, who owned a small construction company.[5][3][6] She has a younger sister named Whitney.[3][7] The family lived outside Austin.[8] Heard's father broke horses in his freetime, and she grew up riding horses, hunting, and fishing with him.[8] She also participated in beauty pageants, although as an adult she has stated that she could no longer \"support the objectification\".[8] When Heard was 16, her best friend died in a car crash. Heard, who was raised Catholic, subsequently declared herself an atheist.[9] Around the same time, she began reading books by writers such as Ayn Rand, Ray Bradbury,\u00a0and George Orwell, and began questioning society around her.[5] At the age of 17, she no longer felt comfortable in Texas[8] and dropped out of her Catholic high school to move to New York City.[6][5] She eventually earned a diploma through a home-study course.[9] In NYC, she supported herself through modeling,[6] but soon moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.[8]\nHeard's earliest acting work included appearances in two music videos, Kenny Chesney's \"There Goes My Life\" and Eisley's \"I Wasn't Prepared\", and small supporting roles in the television series Jack &amp; Bobby (2004), The Mountain (2004), and The O.C. (2005). She made her film debut in a minor role in the sports drama Friday Night Lights (2004), followed by small supporting roles in films such as Drop Dead Sexy (2005), North Country (2005), Side FX (2005), Price to Pay (2006), You Are Here (2006), and Alpha Dog (2006), and guest starring spot in an episode of the police procedural Criminal Minds.\nHeard's first starring role was playing the main character's love interest in The CW's teen drama Hidden Palms, which the network wanted to replace summer reruns of other series aimed for teenage audiences. The series premiered in the United States on May 30, 2007 to mixed to negative reviews. It was also unpopular with audiences, leading the CW to air only eight of the planned 12 episodes before canceling it.[10][11] The same year, Heard also appeared in the short movie Day 73 with Sarah,[12] the critically panned teen drama Remember the Daze, and an episode of the Showtime series Californication.[13]\nHeard gained more mainstream recognition in 2008, when she appeared in supporting roles in the Judd Apatow-produced stoner comedy Pineapple Express[14] and the martial arts drama Never Back Down, both of which were box office successes. That year, she won a Breakthrough Award at the Hollywood Film Festival. Her other 2008 film releases were the critically panned Bret Easton Ellis adaptation The Informers, in which she was part of an ensemble cast,[15] and All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, an unconventional slasher film in which she had one of her first leading roles. Its director, Jonathan Levine, said he had chosen Heard for the title role because \"there was a certain type of beauty and a certain type of innate intelligence that Amber brought to it that is not something you find every day. Certainly, not something you would find in somebody her age. The wisdom she projects I thought was pretty remarkable.\"[16] Mandy Lane had already premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, and had been initially picked for distribution by Harvey Weinstein.[17][18] After a negative test screening, Weinstein dropped the film, and it was then released in the United Kingdom in 2008 by a different distributing company.[19] It did not have a theatrical release in the United States until 2013. The Los Angeles Times stated that Heard gave her most \"definitive [performance] to date [2013]\" in the film,[20] and The Washington Post wrote that she gave a \"psychologically interesting performance\".[21]\nIn 2009, Heard had roles in the critically panned horror film The Stepfather and in three comedies, the limited-release indie ExTerminators, the critically and commercially successful Zombieland, and the box office disappointment The Joneses. Although she otherwise received relatively little attention from established critics due to her roles being mainly supporting at this point, Variety wrote that \"she steals the show\" from the film's more established star, Demi Moore, in The Joneses.[22] The following year, Heard starred in the indie drama The River Why and continued her work in the horror genre in John Carpenter's The Ward, which was a critical and commercial disappointment. Carpenter has later stated that he was disappointed in the film but \"loved working with Amber and would work with her again without hesitation.\"[23] She also co-produced and starred in the independent thriller And Soon the Darkness.[24]\nHeard's next role was as the female lead opposite Johnny Depp in the Hunter S. Thompson adaptation The Rum Diary (2011), which received mixed reviews[25][26] and was not a commercial success.[27][28] Heard's other 2011 film release was Drive Angry, a supernatural action thriller in which she was paired with Nicolas Cage.[29] Although the film was critically panned[30] and underperformed commercially,[31] film critic Roger Ebert wrote that she \"does everything that can possibly be done\" with her character, a waitress who becomes entangled in an undead man's mission to save his daughter from a cult.[32] In February 2011, Heard also appeared on the British television program Top Gear.[33] Heard appeared in no new films until 2013, when she starred in the thriller Paranoia, the action-comedy Machete Kills, and the satirical drama Syrup. All three were critical and box office failures. Her only film release in 2014, the action-thriller 3 Days to Kill, was a box office success but panned by critics.\nHeard had prominent roles in four films released in 2015, which led James Mottram of the British newspaper The Independent to call it a \"watershed year\" in her career.[34] In the comedy-drama Magic Mike XXL she played a photographer who flirts with Channing Tatum's protagonist; like its predecessor, Magic Mike (2012), the film was a large box office success.[35] Digital Spy described Heard as \"a convincing girl-next-door type\".[36] Heard also had a small supporting role as a ballet dancer in Tom Hooper's critically successful historical drama The Danish Girl (2015), which premiered at the 72nd Venice Film Festival.[37][38] In her third 2015 release, the independent crime thriller The Adderall Diaries, she starred opposite James Franco, Christian Slater, and Ed Harris. Indiewire gave the film a mixed review and stated that Heard was \"miscast\" but \"displays much potential and has succeeded in a bid to be taken more seriously.\"[39] Her fourth role in 2015 was opposite Christopher Walken in the television film One More Time, which aired on Starz. For her role as a struggling singer-songwriter, she took singing lessons and learned to play piano and guitar.[40] International Business Times described Heard as \"talented enough to share a few heartfelt moments in a character that mostly operates on the defensive.\"[41] The Los Angeles Times called her performance \"superb\" and The Film Stage stated that Heard did an \"admirable job\".[42][43]\nIn addition to her other roles in 2015, Heard played the female lead in the Martin Amis adaptation London Fields, which was initially scheduled to premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.[44] It was pulled from the festival roster after director Mathew Cullen sued the film's producers, accusing them of fraud and of using his name to promote a cut of the film he did not support.[45] The film's stars, including Heard, had also written to the producers, objecting to the cut that was seen at press and industry screenings in Toronto.[46] London Fields and Heard's performance received highly negative reviews,[47][48][49] and she stated that \"it was one of the most difficult movies to film and it has proven to continue to be difficult...I can't say I did her [the character] justice.\"[34] In November 2016, Heard was sued by the film's producers for $10 million, claiming that she and Cullen made unauthorized changes to the film's script and failed to finish voice-over work.[50][51][52] Heard countersued claiming the producers violated a nudity clause in her contract.[53] In September 2018, a settlement was reached,[54] and London Fields was released, becoming a box office failure and earning Heard a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.[55][56]\nIn 2017, Heard appeared as part of an ensemble cast in Lake Bell's indie comedy I Do... Until I Don't and joined the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) cast as Mera, Aquaman's Atlantean queen, in the superhero film Justice League. She reprised the role the following year in Aquaman (2018), which  co-starred Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe and marked Heard's first major role in a studio film.[7][57][58] She has stated that one of the reasons attracting her to the part was Mera being \"a strong, independent, self-possessed superhero in her own right\",[7] who rejects being called Aquawoman instead of by her own name.[8] Aquaman became the fifth most profitable release of 2018, and the most profitable DCEU installment up to that point.[59] The same year, Heard was appointed global ambassador for cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al Paris.[8]\nIn 2019, Heard played supporting roles in the independent dramas Her Smell and Gully. Her upcoming projects include the CBS All Access miniseries The Stand, based on Stephen King's eponymous novel and co-starring James Marsden, Odessa Young\u00a0and Henry Zaga.[60]\nHeard has raised awareness about domestic and sexual violence. Together with actors Gabourey Sidibe and Freida Pinto, she read a speech on behalf of sexual assault victim Emily Doe at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards in 2016; Doe was the recipient of an award.[61] Heard also made a public service announcement about domestic violence for the #GirlGaze Project,[62] and has written about her experiences of domestic violence in the December 2016 issue of Porter magazine[63] and in an op-ed for The Washington Post in December 2018.[64] She has been an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador for women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence since December 2018,[65][66]\nand has also been named a Human Rights Champion for the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.[67] In May 2019, she gave a speech in support of the SHIELD Act\u00a0on Capitol Hill, discussing her experience of having had her private nude photos hacked and distributed online without her consent during the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos in 2014.[68] On November 4, 2019, The New York Times published an op-ed written by Heard on the subject.[69]\n In a 2008 interview, Heard stated that she is agnostic.[70] She is fluent in American Sign Language and Spanish.[71]\nHeard publicly came out at GLAAD's 25th anniversary event in 2010,[72] but has stated, \"I don't label myself one way or another\u2014I have had successful relationships with men and now a woman. I love who I love; it's the person that matters.\"[73] Of her decision to come out, she said: \"I think when I became aware of my role in the media, I had to ask myself an important question 'Am I part of the problem?' And I think that when millions and millions of hard-working, taxpaying Americans are denied their rights and denied their equality you have to ask yourself what are the factors that are an epidemic problem and that's what this is.\"[72] Heard was in a relationship with photographer Tasya van Ree from 2008 to 2012.[72][74]\nIn 2014, Heard was one of the victims of the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos, in which her private nude photos were hacked and distributed without her consent.[69]\n\nHeard met actor Johnny Depp while filming The Rum Diary in 2011, and they began living together the following year.[74][75] They were married in a private civil ceremony at their home in Los Angeles on February 3, 2015.[75][76] In April 2015, Heard and Depp breached Australia's biosecurity laws when they failed to declare their two Yorkshire terriers to the Australian Customs Service when they flew by private jet into Queensland, where he was working on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.[77][78] Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation.[79] She was placed on a $1,000 one-month good behavior bond for producing a false document;[80] Heard and Depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the biosecurity laws.[80] The Guardian called the case the \"highest profile criminal quarantine case\" in Australian history.[80]\nHeard filed for divorce from Depp on May 23, 2016, and obtained a temporary restraining order against him, stating in her court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.[81][82][83][84] In response, Depp's lawyers alleged that she was \"attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.\"[81][85] Heard testified about the abuse under oath at a divorce court deposition.[84] Evidence of the alleged abuse from her court filings was also published in the media.[85][81] A settlement was reached on August 16, 2016,[86] and the divorce was finalized in January 2017.[87] Heard dismissed the restraining order, and the former couple issued a joint statement saying that their \"relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.\"[86] Depp paid Heard a settlement of US$7\u00a0million, which she donated to the ACLU and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.[86][88][89]\nFollowing the divorce, Heard dated tech entrepreneur Elon Musk for several months, until early 2018.[7]\nIn early 2019, Depp sued Heard for US$50 million for defamation over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in December 2018, which \"depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her,\"[90][91] despite it not mentioning Depp or any of the alleged incidences of violence perpetrated by him.[84] Depp also alleged that Heard had been the abuser, and that her allegations constituted a hoax against him.[91] In response, Heard said that Depp's claims are not true and repeated her allegations and evidence, maintaining that Depp was abusive towards her.[84] Her lawyer further stated that Depp is attempting to \"gaslight the world\"[92] and \"silence\" her.[93] She asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit\u2014which Depp filed in Virginia, where the Post is located\u2014so that the case could be tried in California (where most of the witnesses reside), but this request was denied.[94][95][96]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRadric Delantic Davis (born February 12, 1980),[2][3] known professionally as Gucci Mane, is an American rapper. He helped pioneer the hip hop subgenre of trap music alongside fellow Atlanta-based rappers T.I. and Young Jeezy, particularly in the 2000s and 2010s.[4] In 2005, Gucci Mane debuted with Trap House, followed by his second and third albums, Hard to Kill and Trap-A-Thon in 2006. His fourth album, Back to the Trap House, was released in 2007. Following a string of critically and commercially successful mixtape releases in 2009, Gucci Mane released his sixth studio album, The State vs. Radric Davis, his first gold-certified album. Following time spent in prison between 2014 and 2016, he re-emerged with several new retail projects, including Everybody Looking (2016), which was released to critical praise. His 2016 collaboration with Rae Sremmurd, titled \"Black Beatles\", provided Gucci Mane with his first number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. He has since released numerous albums; his latest one, Woptober II, was released on October 18, 2019.[5] Gucci Mane has released 13 studio albums and over 71 mixtapes throughout his career. In 2007, he founded his own label, 1017 Records. He has worked with artists such as Drake, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Selena Gomez, Mariah Carey and Marilyn Manson. His prolific mixtape releases and long-standing presence as a trap music innovator in the Atlanta music scene has established him as a major influence on younger Atlanta rappers like Young Thug, Migos, Rich Homie Quan, 21 Savage and Lil Yachty, and he has been called an \"avatar of East Atlanta,\" and \"the most influential underground rapper of the past decade\".[6][7] Radric Delantic Davis was born on February 12, 1980, in Bessemer, Alabama, to former U.S serviceman and power plant worker Ralph Everett Dudley (born August 23, 1955),[8] and social worker and teacher Vicky Jean Davis (born 1955).[9] Davis' family had a strong military background. His paternal grandfather, James Dudley, Sr., served in the military for twelve years, including during World War II, as a chef,[10] and his maternal grandfather, Walter Lee Davis, served in the Pacific during World War II and on the USS South Dakota.[9] Davis' father also served in the military, being stationed in Korea for two years.[9] Davis' parents met in 1978; Davis' mother had a son from another relationship, Victor Davis. When Davis was born, his father was on the run from the police for dealing crack cocaine and heroin,[11] and had fled to Detroit, Michigan.[12] Davis' father was not present to sign the birth certificate, and Davis took his mother's last name.[13] Growing up, Davis was raised by his paternal grandmother while his mother attended college to get her degree.[14] Davis' mother was a teacher who taught him to read at a young age, and spent most of her time teaching him scriptures from the Bible.[15] Davis' first school was Jonesboro Elementary, where he attended kindergarten and the first several grades of elementary school.[11] His older half-brother Victor introduced Davis to hip hop when Davis was six years old by bringing Davis to a Run-DMC, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J concert.[16] Before moving to Atlanta with his mother, Davis had a distant relationship with his father, who would visit at irregular intervals;[17] the visits stopped when Davis' father had two children with another woman and began to prioritize his children in Atlanta over Davis.[18] Davis moved with his single mother to Atlanta in 1989 when he was nine years old due to family problems in Bessemer. Davis' mother had a boyfriend in Atlanta and planned to move in with him, but she decided otherwise at the last minute. They later moved in with someone Davis' mother met in church.[19] Davis' family was kicked out of the house and did not have a stable living environment until his father set them up in a Knights Inn.[18] Davis grew up in an area which was high in crime.[20] Davis' mother moved Davis and Victor to East Atlanta and Davis attended Cedar Grove Elementary School.[15] He was generally good in school and considered himself athletic although he did not participate in school sports.[11] Davis dealt drugs, mainly selling cannabis with his older brother. Davis sold cannabis on his own and ended up using his Christmas money to acquire crack cocaine while in the eighth grade, starting his career as a drug dealer.[21] By the time Davis began taking his side hobby as a drug dealer as a career, he was a freshman at Ronald E. McNair High School, where he got good grades and was considered popular among his peers.[22] Davis never actually took drugs for the first few years that he was dealing drugs, though his first experience was smoking cannabis with a girl he had a crush on. He entered a friends-with-benefits arrangement with the girl with whom he regularly smoked cannabis, leading to a slight psychological addiction.[23] Even though Davis had been selling drugs for nearly two years by 1995, he had never encountered a violent situation. When he was fifteen, Davis was riding his push bicycle when a man stopped him and pointed a Desert Eagle at his head. Davis was robbed of all valuable items following the encounter[24] and began to carry a .380 caliber handgun.[25] Davis had numerous other life-threatening situations, including a feud with a local street gang who titled themselves \"the East Shoals Boys\" in 1997. The feud resulted in Davis' friend Javon being beaten close to death[26] and adult men walking into McNair High School looking for Davis.[27] The feud resolved itself when Davis and several other friends got into a fistfight with members of the East Shoals Boys, who have since then left Davis alone.[28] Davis graduated from McNair High School in 1998 with a 3.0 GPA and a HOPE Scholarship to Georgia Perimeter College. He took a computer programming course, though he rarely attended and was kicked out in 2001[29] after being caught with possession of crack cocaine by an undercover police officer.[30] Davis was sentenced to 90 days in a county jail and then probation.[30] Davis enjoyed writing poetry as a child, and began rapping at the age of 14.[2] Following his first arrest, Davis began to take music seriously and released La Flare on Str8 Drop Records. It was pressed onto about 1000\u00a0CDs and distributed throughout East Atlanta.[31] Following the release of La Flare, and being inspired by Master P, Davis decided he wanted to start a music label.[32] Davis began to manage rapper Lil Buddy in 2001.[33] In 2002, Davis linked up with SYS Records as a member of the Sign Yourself Click. Davis also linked up with producer Zaytoven and made his own label, LaFlare Entertainment.[34] After heading to New York in search of a distribution deal and returning home empty, he was introduced to Big Cat, the head of Big Cat Records. Ultimately deciding to form an alliance with the label that brought Khia to prominence, Davis released the song \"Black Tee\", a response to Dem Franchize Boyz hit record, \"White Tee\", as well as a collaboration with fellow rising local rapper Young Jeezy with \"So Icy\".[34] Securing a distribution deal with Tommy Boy Records, Davis continued to work the underground while preparing for the release of his debut album. In 2005, Davis released his independent debut album entitled Trap House, which featured the single \"Icy\" with Young Jeezy. Disputes over the rights to this single caused a rift between the two artists. Trap House was considered a success for an independent artist. The album crept into the Top 20 of the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and landed at the top spot on the Billboard Heatseekers Album chart. Guest appearances include Bun B, Killer Mike, Lil Scrappy, Jody Breeze and Khujo of Goodie Mobb. Hard to Kill followed in 2006. It included the hit single \"Freaky Gurl\", which peaked at number 12 on the Hot Rap Tracks, number 19 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and at number 62 on the Billboard Hot 100. He also shot videos for the tracks \"Street Nigazzz\"[35] and \"Pillz\".[36] The official remix of \"Freaky Gurl\" featuring Ludacris and Lil' Kim was included on his 2007 commercial debut album, Back to the Trap House. Gucci Mane appeared on OJ da Juiceman's \"Make Tha Trap Say Aye\" and began working on various mixtapes.[37] Following the success of his mixtapes Bird Money and Writing on the Wall, Gucci Mane signed to Warner Bros. Records in May 2009.[38] He appeared on remixes of the songs \"Boom Boom Pow\" by The Black Eyed Peas, \"Obsessed\" by Mariah Carey and \"5 Star Chick\" by Yo Gotti and made a guest appearance on Mario's \"Break Up\". He made a total of 17 guest appearances in 2009. Gucci Mane's second studio album, The State vs. Radric Davis, was released by Warner Bros. Records on December 8, 2009. Its first single, \"Wasted\" featuring Plies, was originally from Gucci Mane's 2009 mixtape Guccimania.[39] It peaked at number 36 on the Hot 100, number 3 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and number 3 on the Rap Songs, making it Gucci Mane's most successful single to date. The second single was \"Spotlight\" featuring Usher. The third single was \"Lemonade\". The fourth single was \"Bingo\", featuring Waka Flocka Flame and Soulja Boy Tell 'Em. On October 2, 2009, Gucci Mane was listed at number 6 on MTV's annual Hottest MC in the Game list.[40] After being released from jail,[clarification needed] Gucci Mane stated that he would start or change the label name from So Icey Entertainment to 1017 Brick Squad Records. The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted, was released on September 28, 2010.[41] The first single from this release was \"Gucci Time\",[42] produced by and featuring Swizz Beatz. It premiered on Gucci Mane's MySpace page on August 6[43] and was released to US urban radio stations on August 24, 2010.[44] On March 18, 2011, Gucci Mane released his 10th EP, The Return of Mr. Zone 6, mostly produced by Drumma Boy.[45] It debuted at #18 on the Billboard 200, and is his highest charting EP. The album also debuted at #2 on the Rap albums chart and #8 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. He also released a collaboration album with Waka Flocka Flame named Ferrari Boyz on August 5, Gucci Mane's first collaboration album.[46] Its first single was \"She Be Puttin On\" featuring Brick Squad labelmate Slim Dunkin. Ferrari Boyz debuted at #21 on the Billboard 200. Gucci Mane released another collaboration album, this time with rapper V-Nasty, called BAYTL, on December 13.[47] The album's first single was \"Whip Appeal\" featuring P2theLA.[48] Three days after BAYTL's release, while traveling to the video shoot of \"Push Ups\", Slim Dunkin, who was featured on the song, was shot and killed after an argument at an Atlanta recording studio.[49] On February 5, 2012, Gucci Mane released his Trap Back mixtape. It features guest appearances from Yo Gotti, Rocko, Waka Flocka Flame, Jadakiss, 2 Chainz, and Future, the latter three appearing on the third studio album of Jeezy (who had removed the \"Young\" from his name) Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition. The first single was the mixtape's title track.[50] Music videos were filmed for the songs \"Quiet\", \"Face Card\", \"In Love With a White Girl\" featuring Yo Gotti, \"Chicken Room\" featuring Rocko, the title track, and \"Sometimes\" featuring Future.[51][52][53][54][55][56] Trap Back was met with positive reviews, scoring a 7.8 from Pitchfork Media, a 7.5 from AllHipHop, and an \"L\" from XXL.[57][58][59] On May 25, 2012, Gucci Mane released another mixtape, I'm Up. Music videos were released for the songs \"Supa Cocky\", \"Kansas\" featuring Jim Jones, \"Wish You Would\" featuring Verse Simmonds, and \"Too Damn Sexy\" featuring Jeremih. Gucci Mane released yet another mixtape, Trap God, on October 17, 2012. The mixtape included features from Brick Squad affiliate Waka Flocka Flame and frequent collaborators Rick Ross, Future, Meek Mill and Birdman, among others. On September 13, 2012, he appeared on Waka Flocka Flame's mixtape Salute Me Or Shoot Me 4 on two tracks. On February 12, 2013, Gucci Mane released his mixtape Trap God 2. By the end of March, Gucci Mane released three more mixtapes \u2013 Free Bricks 2 with Young Scooter, Trap Back 2 and EastAtlantaMemphis with Young Dolph. Gucci Mane announced in February 2013 that he was releasing a new studio album entitled Trap House III, the third installment of his Trap House series.[60] It was released on May 21, 2013. On May 31, 2013, Gucci Mane also announced he was releasing a new album entitled Mr. GuWop later in the year, featuring appearances by personal friend and industrial rock performer Marilyn Manson, who also helped him to give shape to the album's sound and musical direction.[61] On June 5, 2013, Gucci Mane announced that 1017 Brick Squad would release their first group compilation album, Big Money Talk, in 2013.[62] On September 7, 2013, various members of 1017 Brick Squad and Brick Squad Monopoly traded shots back and forth on Twitter, including Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka Flame, Frenchie, Wooh Da Kid, and OJ da Juiceman. Gucci Mane would go on to say \"fuck brick squad\" and accuse his former manager, Waka Flocka Flame's mother Debra Antney, of stealing money from OJ da Juiceman and French Montana. Frenchie also accused Gucci Mane of paying for Young Vito's lawyer, the accused murderer of former 1017 Brick Squad artist Slim Dunkin, which Gucci Mane denied. Frenchie would release a diss record towards Gucci Mane the following day.[63] During the following days, it was revealed that OJ da Juiceman, Young Dolph, Frenchie and Wooh da Kid were no longer, or in some cases had never been, signed to 1017 Brick Squad Records.[citation needed][64] It was also revealed that 1017 Brick Squad had lost their distribution deal with Atlantic Records, and the label might be disbanded.[65][66] On September 9, 2013, Gucci Mane advertised on Twitter that he was willing to sell the recording contracts of what he considered his main artists: Waka Flocka Flame, Young Scooter, and Young Thug.[66] During his Twitter tirade he dissed many rappers and producers such as Nicki Minaj, Plies, Drake, Rocko, Polow da Don, 2 Chainz, Rick Ross, Jeezy, T.I., Yo Gotti, Frenchie, 808 Mafia, Waka Flocka Flame and Tyga among others.[67] The following day he released a new single, \"Stealing\", featuring OJ da Juiceman, produced by Zaytoven. On the song he disses T.I., Jeezy, and Yo Gotti. That night he also released a new mixtape Diary of a Trap God.[68] Following the mixtape's release his barrage of tweets stopped, and he claimed his Twitter account was hacked by his former manager Coach K for $5,000.[69] Subsequently, he deleted all the controversial tweets and hours later deleted his Twitter account.[70] On September 22, 2013, Gucci Mane admitted to making the tweets, and claimed he was binging on codeine and promethazine during the time. He went on to apologize to the fans, his family, and the music industry members he offended.

The next day, Gucci Mane released the first single under his new deal with Atlantic Records, \"First Day Out Tha Feds\".[90][91][92] On June 3, 2016, Gucci Mane appeared on \"Champions\", the first single off of GOOD Music's Cruel Winter album.[93] On June 17, 2016, Gucci Mane made his first performance since being released from prison at the Elan Mansion, an Atlanta club.[94] On June 25, 2016, he announced his ninth studio album and first since his release from prison, Everybody Looking, which was released on July 22, 2016.[95] One day later he headlined the \"Gucci & Friends\" concert at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta; the show featured Fetty Wap, 2 Chainz, Future and Drake.[96] Following his release from prison, Gucci Mane became the subject of an internet conspiracy theory that stated he was a clone of the \"real\" Gucci Mane, citing the rapper's new slim physique, a slight change in his voice and his shift towards a healthier lifestyle as supposed proof. Gucci Mane denied that he was a clone and poked fun at the theory in an Instagram post.[97] In September 2016, Gucci Mane collaborated with Rae Sremmurd on the single \"Black Beatles\", which in November 2016 reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Gucci Mane's first number-one single as a featured artist.[98] The song was described by Billboard as the \"unexpected commercial high point for Gucci\"[99] as it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 7 non-consecutive weeks between November 2016 and January 2017. He released Woptober on October 14, 2016, and released a side project called Free Bricks 2 with Future.[100] His tenth studio album, \"The Return of East Atlanta Santa\", was released on December 16, 2016.[101] On May 26, 2017, Gucci Mane released Droptopwop, a collaborative mixtape with Metro Boomin. The 10-track mixtape features Rick Ross, Offset of Migos, Young Dolph and 2 Chainz.[102][103] In August 2017, Gucci Mane announced his eleventh studio album, Mr. Davis.[104] The album was released on October 13, 2017.[105] It includes \"I Get the Bag\" featuring Migos, which peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100, his most successful single as a solo artist to date.[106] Two months later, Gucci Mane released his twelfth studio album El Gato: The Human Glacier, produced entirely by Southside. A week after its release, in similar fashion to the announcements of previous projects, Gucci Mane announced his thirteenth album, Evil Genius, released on December 7, 2018.[107][108][109] The newly formed group came together for the first time at Coachella 2019. It is rumored that the newly formed group, Gucci Gang, which includes Gucci Mane, Lil Pump and Smokepurpp are working on an upcoming joint project. Smokepurpp went on to Travis Mills' Beats 1 interview to give the news. Gucci Mane made his acting debut in the 2012 film Birds of a Feather, co-starring with Producer Zaytoven. The same year, he was featured in Spring Breakers which also featured James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine.[110] In May 2016, Gucci Mane began teasing images of his upcoming clothing line called Delantic, which will feature a range of apparel, from T-shirts and hoodies to underwear.[111] In September 2017, Davis published his autobiography, The Autobiography of Gucci Mane.[112][113][114] The book was written during Davis's time in prison and was authored with Neil Martinez-Belkin, a former XXL Magazine editor.[115] In the weeks before the publication, Davis released a trailer for the book consisting of a short montage directed by videographer Cam Kirk.[116] The Autobiography of Gucci Mane went on to become a New York Times bestseller.[117][118][119] The New Yorker said the book \"reads like a set of liner notes that try to impose a central order on his life story.\"[120] In 2019 Davis started working with Italian fashion house Gucci.[121] The brand had previously not associated itself with the rapper due to his criminal record and image. After a few years of personal development that included Davis getting married and improving his fitness[122] Gucci announced he would be the face of their Gucci Cruise 2020 Campaign.[123][124] Davis married Keyshia Ka'oir in Miami on October 17, 2017.[125][126] She is the founder and owner of Ka'oir Cosmetics and Ka'oir Fitness. The wedding was paid for by BET which produced an accompanying 10-segment TV series, The Mane Event, depicting wedding preparations and the ceremony.[127] Davis had proposed to Ka'oir after performing at an Atlanta Hawks basketball game.[128] Davis disclosed in his autobiography that he has a son born in 2007 whom he had not known about until 2016.[129] In April 2001, Davis was arrested on cocaine charges and sentenced to 90 days in county jail.[130] On May 10, 2005, Davis was attacked by a group of men at a house in Decatur, Georgia. Davis and his companions shot at the group, killing one. The corpse of that attacker, Pookie Loc, was found later behind a nearby middle school. Davis turned himself in to police investigators on May 19, 2005, and was subsequently charged with murder. Davis claimed that the shots fired by him and his party were in self-defense.[130] The DeKalb County district attorney's office dropped the murder charge in January 2006 due to insufficient evidence. The previous October, in an unrelated matter, Davis had pleaded no contest to a charge of aggravated assault for assaulting a nightclub promoter the previous June; at the time the murder charge was dropped, he was serving a six-month county jail sentence for this.[131] Davis was released from jail in late January 2006.[2] In September 2008, Davis was arrested for a probation violation for completing only 25 out of 600 community service hours following his 2005 arrest for aggravated assault. He was sentenced to a year in the county jail but was released after six months.[132] He was incarcerated in the Fulton County jail for probation violation[133] and released on May 12, 2010.[134] On November 2, 2010, Gucci Mane was arrested for driving on the wrong side of the road, running a red light or stop sign, damage to government property, obstruction, no license, no proof of insurance and other traffic charges. He was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital.[135] On January 4, 2011, a judge in the Superior Court of Georgia's Fulton County ordered Davis to a psychiatric hospital, according to court documents. The documents reveal that his lawyers filed a Special Plea of Mental Incompetency on December 27, arguing that he was unable \"to go forward and/or intelligently participate in the probation revocation hearing.\"[136] Davis was arrested twice in April 2011 in Dekalb County, on April 13 on one charge of battery,[137] and on April 20 on two charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.[138] On September 13, 2011, Davis was given a six-month county jail sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of battery, two counts of reckless conduct and one count of disorderly conduct.[139] He was released on December 11, 2011.[140] On March 22, 2013, the Atlanta Police Department issued a warrant for the arrest of Davis after he allegedly attacked a fan who was trying to take a photo with him. A soldier, \"James,\" claimed that Gucci Mane hit him with a bottle in the head while he was talking to a security guard about getting a photo with the rapper. He was treated at Grady Memorial Hospital and received 10 stitches.[141] Four days later, a second man going by the initials T.J. claimed Gucci Mane punched him in the face when T. J. tried to shake his hand after a concert performance at Club Onyx in Philadelphia.[142] In the early morning of March 27, Davis turned himself in on the aggravated assault charges. He was denied bond and was incarcerated at Fulton County Jail. His lawyer said that witnesses claim Gucci Mane had nothing to do with the assault. He appeared in court on April 10, 2013, and was indicted on one count of aggravated assault.[143][144][145] Two days later he posted $75,000 bail, and the following day, April 14, he was arrested again for a parole violation.[146] He was released three weeks later, on May 2, 2013.[147] On September 13, 2013, Gucci Mane was hanging out with a friend and was behaving \"erratically.\" The friend decided to call the police to help him out. When the police arrived, Gucci Mane began cursing and threatening them. Authorities took him into custody at 12:05\u00a0a.m., and found marijuana and a handgun on him. He was booked on charges of carrying a concealed weapon, possession of marijuana, and disorderly conduct. He was reportedly hospitalized following the arrest.[148] On September 30, 2013, it was revealed that Gucci Mane would serve 183 days in jail on charges of firearm possession by a convicted felon, disorderly conduct, carrying a concealed weapon, and marijuana possession, among others.[149] On December 3, 2013, Gucci Mane was charged in federal court with two counts of possessing a firearm as a felon. According to the federal prosecutor, Gucci Mane was in possession of two different loaded guns between September 12 and 14, 2013, and could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.[150] On May 13, 2014, Gucci Mane pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He agreed to a plea deal that would result in him being in prison until late 2016.[151] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, his release date would be September 20, 2016.[152] He served his sentence in the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana.[153][154] On May 26, 2016, Gucci Mane was released from prison ahead of his scheduled September date; this was due to Gucci Mane not initially being credited for the time he served while waiting for his court date.[155] In May 2005, Gucci Mane released his first single \"Icy\", which featured Young Jeezy, at the time an upcoming artist as well. Tensions grew when \"Icy\" was believed to be put on Young Jeezy's debut album Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101, although it never was. It was put on Gucci Mane's debut album Trap House. Young Jeezy claimed he was never paid his royalties for the song.[156] On May 9, 2005, Young Jeezy released the controversial song \"Stay Strapped,\" placing a $10,000 bounty on Gucci Mane's chain. Gucci Mane responded by stating, \"That nigga Young Jeezy, man. That nigga fake.\"[157][158] On May 19, 2005, tensions were soaring between Gucci Mane and Young Jeezy when four men set up Gucci Mane at a stripper's home and attempted to rob him. Gucci Mane grabbed his pistol and shot one of the assailants. The assailant, Pookie Loc, a CTE affiliate of Young Jeezy, was later found buried behind Columbia Middle School in Decatur, Georgia. An official warrant was put out for Gucci Mane's arrest. Days later he turned himself in to police after hearing about the warrant.[159] During a phone conversation, Gucci Mane stated, \"I just want to let everyone know I'm not a murderer. I was upset. I was scared a little bit, but I had to do what I had to do. You gotta be a man about it. I'm not a bad person. I have remorse for everything that happened.\" Young Jeezy responded to Gucci Mane and the allegations of hiring Pookie Loc to rob Gucci Mane by saying that Gucci Mane was \"trying to turn a bad situation into good publicity and sell his record.\"[160] On January 17, 2006, prosecutors dropped the murder charge against Gucci Mane as he maintained he was acting out of self-defense.[161] On June 15, 2006, after tensions had cooled, Gucci Mane came at Young Jeezy on the song \"745\" rapping, \"Do I smell pussy? Nah, that's Jeezy. You ain't a snowman, you more like a snowflake, cupcake, corn flake. Nigga, you too fake.\"[162] On June 15, 2009, Young Jeezy came at Gucci Mane on the song \"24, 23,\" rapping, \"I'm on some Louie shit today, fuck some Gucci, man. These niggas still on my dick, they like some groupies, man. Can't keep they lips closed, they worse than \u2018Coochies Mane\u2019.\"[163] In light of the renewed tensions with the Crip-affiliated Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane started associating himself with the Bloods street gang, known rivals of the Crips, with Gucci Mane going on to use Blood imagery in his music videos as well as associating himself with known Blood figures in hip-hop, such as The Game.[164][165] On December 4, 2009, during a radio interview with DJ Drama and Jeezy, Gucci Mane called in to finally announce a truce between the two, saying, \"I'd just like to say, it's way bigger than all of us. I feel like the way the city's been supporting all three of us, they deserve this. It's about that time, man. We're getting older, growing, so let's do it for the city.\"[166] On March 24, 2010, members of Gucci Mane's crew 1017 Brick Squad and members of Jeezy's crew Corporate Thugz got into an altercation outside an Atlanta clothing store. Neither Gucci Mane nor Jeezy were present during the altercation.[167] On December 2, 2011, Jeezy explained how the beef originated, stating that Gucci Mane got mad at him because he would not perform \"Icy\" together; Jeezy said he could not perform the song because he was going through major throat surgery.[168] On October 10, 2012, during a radio interview, Gucci Mane announced he had no more love for Jeezy due to his controversial fight with rapper Rick Ross. During a radio interview, Jeezy responded by stating, \"Man everybody knows that boy is retarded. Ain't nobody taking him seriously. He has an ice cream cone on his face, let's be for real. Given that said, I'm not going back, I'm going forward.\"[169][170] On October 15, 2012, Gucci Mane came at Jeezy and other artists on the song \"Truth\" by rapping, \"A ten thousand dollar bounty put on my neck. I hope you didn't pay them cause they didn't have no success\" and, \"Go dig your partner up, nigga, bet he can't say shit,\" referring to Pookie Loc.[171] On March 16, 2012, R&B singer Keyshia Cole came at Gucci Mane for the controversial song \"Truth\" on which he had rapped, \"I did a song with Keyshia Cole and I know you still miss her. But Puff was fucking her while you was falling in love wit her,\" implying that, during the time of her rumored relationship with Young Jeezy, Cole was cheating on him with her \"Last Night\" collaborator P. Diddy. Cole stated on the radio, \"Putting all ya trust in some of these 'Hood Rappers'... How you gonna be a G, and you spreading lies, to sell mix tapes! Where ya talent at. Dude ain't have to lie though! Could've kept me out of it.\"[172] Gucci Mane attracted controversy when his song \"Fuck The World\" had a controversial line that was directed to fellow Atlanta rapper Yung Joc, when he rapped \"I got all eyes on me like Pac did, but I ain't tryin' to go broke like Joc did.\" During a radio conversation, Joc reacted to the song by stating \"Gucci is a master at getting his name in other people's mouths, I ain't trippin', I know what my financial situation is.\"[173] On March 15, 2013, Gucci Mane announced that frequent collaborator and close friend Waka Flocka Flame was \"dropped\" from 1017 Brick Squad Records. The two rappers proceeded to throw insults back and forth on Twitter.[174] Though it was reported that Gucci Mane's Twitter account was hacked, Waka Flocka Flame stated, \"Dont let da media fool u. This shit real Shawty.\"[175] On March 27, 2013, during an MTV Jams interview with Sway, Waka Flocka Flame explained that he would never do music nor business with Gucci Mane ever again. Neither of the rappers have explained where the controversy originated from. Waka Flocka Flame has stated, \"I guess we both be at the finish line we just going our own routes. That's all I can say. What's the reason? Sometimes it's none of your fuckin' business what's the reason. Just understand two men went they own ways but it's no problem.\"[176] On November 19, 2013, it was revealed that Gucci Mane had filed a lawsuit against Waka Flocka Flame, Waka Flocka Flame's mother Debra Antney, OJ da Juiceman, rapper Khia Stone and producer Zaytoven. The lawsuit accuses the parties of fraud, racketeering, and breach of contract. According to Gucci Mane, Antney took control of 1017 Brick Squad Records, LLC., without permission, and used it to create three separate offshoot labels. \"Gucci is also accusing the parties in the lawsuit of withholding royalties and inflating the cost of label expenditures\" and claimed that Antney seized his assets and stole a ring and a necklace.[177] In his lawsuit, Gucci Mane also says that Antney took more than the typical 20% management fee. Gucci Mane also alleged that Antney's actions led to his having money and tax problems.[178] In early 2017, issues between the two resurfaced when Waka Flocka Flame released the song \"Was My Dawg\", which many believed referred to Gucci Mane.[179] In September 2013, Gucci Mane sent a series of derogatory tweets to various figures in the hip-hop industry. In the tweets he claimed to have sexual relations with rappers' girlfriends. A couple of days later, Gucci Mane stated that his Twitter account had been hacked.[180] However, he later admitted in his autobiography that he did author the tweets.[181] Studio albums Collaborative albums",

He helped pioneer the hip hop subgenre of trap music alongside fellow Atlanta-based rappers T.I. and Young Jeezy, particularly in the 2000s and 2010s.[4] In 2005, Gucci Mane debuted with Trap House, followed by his second and third albums, Hard to Kill and Trap-A-Thon in 2006. His fourth album, Back to the Trap House, was released in 2007.\nFollowing a string of critically and commercially successful mixtape releases in 2009, Gucci Mane released his sixth studio album, The State vs. Radric Davis, his first gold-certified album. Following time spent in prison between 2014 and 2016, he re-emerged with several new retail projects, including Everybody Looking (2016), which was released to critical praise. His 2016 collaboration with Rae Sremmurd, titled \"Black Beatles\", provided Gucci Mane with his first number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. He has since released numerous albums; his latest one, Woptober II, was released on October 18, 2019.[5]\nGucci Mane has released 13 studio albums and over 71 mixtapes throughout his career. In 2007, he founded his own label, 1017 Records. He has worked with artists such as Drake, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Selena Gomez, Mariah Carey and Marilyn Manson. His prolific mixtape releases and long-standing presence as a trap music innovator in the Atlanta music scene has established him as a major influence on younger Atlanta rappers like Young Thug, Migos, Rich Homie Quan, 21 Savage and Lil Yachty, and he has been called an \"avatar of East Atlanta,\" and \"the most influential underground rapper of the past decade\".[6][7]\nRadric Delantic Davis was born on February 12, 1980, in Bessemer, Alabama, to former U.S serviceman and power plant worker Ralph Everett Dudley (born August 23, 1955),[8] and social worker and teacher Vicky Jean Davis (born 1955).[9] Davis' family had a strong military background. His paternal grandfather, James Dudley, Sr., served in the military for twelve years, including during World War II, as a chef,[10] and his maternal grandfather, Walter Lee Davis, served in the Pacific during World War II and on the USS South Dakota.[9] Davis' father also served in the military, being stationed in Korea for two years.[9]\nDavis' parents met in 1978; Davis' mother had a son from another relationship, Victor Davis. When Davis was born, his father was on the run from the police for dealing crack cocaine and heroin,[11] and had fled to Detroit, Michigan.[12] Davis' father was not present to sign the birth certificate, and Davis took his mother's last name.[13]\nGrowing up, Davis was raised by his paternal grandmother while his mother attended college to get her degree.[14] Davis' mother was a teacher who taught him to read at a young age, and spent most of her time teaching him scriptures from the Bible.[15] Davis' first school was Jonesboro Elementary, where he attended kindergarten and the first several grades of elementary school.[11] His older half-brother Victor introduced Davis to hip hop when Davis was six years old by bringing Davis to a Run-DMC, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J concert.[16] Before moving to Atlanta with his mother, Davis had a distant relationship with his father, who would visit at irregular intervals;[17] the visits stopped when Davis' father had two children with another woman and began to prioritize his children in Atlanta over Davis.[18]\nDavis moved with his single mother to Atlanta in 1989 when he was nine years old due to family problems in Bessemer. Davis' mother had a boyfriend in Atlanta and planned to move in with him, but she decided otherwise at the last minute. They later moved in with someone Davis' mother met in church.[19] Davis' family was kicked out of the house and did not have a stable living environment until his father set them up in a Knights Inn.[18] Davis grew up in an area which was high in crime.[20]\nDavis' mother moved Davis and Victor to East Atlanta and Davis attended Cedar Grove Elementary School.[15] He was generally good in school and considered himself athletic although he did not participate in school sports.[11] Davis dealt drugs, mainly selling cannabis with his older brother. Davis sold cannabis on his own and ended up using his Christmas money to acquire crack cocaine while in the eighth grade, starting his career as a drug dealer.[21]\nBy the time Davis began taking his side hobby as a drug dealer as a career, he was a freshman at Ronald E. McNair High School, where he got good grades and was considered popular among his peers.[22] Davis never actually took drugs for the first few years that he was dealing drugs, though his first experience was smoking cannabis with a girl he had a crush on. He entered a friends-with-benefits arrangement with the girl with whom he regularly smoked cannabis, leading to a slight psychological addiction.[23]\nEven though Davis had been selling drugs for nearly two years by 1995, he had never encountered a violent situation. When he was fifteen, Davis was riding his push bicycle when a man stopped him and pointed a Desert Eagle at his head. Davis was robbed of all valuable items following the encounter[24] and began to carry a .380 caliber handgun.[25] Davis had numerous other life-threatening situations, including a feud with a local street gang who titled themselves \"the East Shoals Boys\" in 1997. The feud resulted in Davis' friend Javon being beaten close to death[26] and adult men walking into McNair High School looking for Davis.[27] The feud resolved itself when Davis and several other friends got into a fistfight with  members of the East Shoals Boys, who have since then left Davis alone.[28]\nDavis graduated from McNair High School in 1998 with a 3.0 GPA and a HOPE Scholarship to Georgia Perimeter College. He took a computer programming course, though he rarely attended and was kicked out in 2001[29] after being caught with possession of crack cocaine by an undercover police officer.[30] Davis was sentenced to 90 days in a county jail and then probation.[30]\nDavis enjoyed writing poetry as a child, and began rapping at the age of 14.[2] Following his first arrest, Davis began to take music seriously and released  La Flare on Str8 Drop Records. It was pressed onto about 1000\u00a0CDs and distributed throughout East Atlanta.[31] Following the release of  La Flare, and being inspired by Master P, Davis decided he wanted to start a music label.[32] Davis began to manage rapper Lil Buddy in 2001.[33] In 2002, Davis linked up with SYS Records as a member of the Sign Yourself Click. Davis also linked up with producer Zaytoven and made his own label, LaFlare Entertainment.[34]\nAfter heading to New York in search of a distribution deal and returning home empty, he was introduced to Big Cat, the head of Big Cat Records.

We're getting older, growing, so let's do it for the city.\"[166]\nOn March 24, 2010, members of Gucci Mane's crew 1017 Brick Squad and members of Jeezy's crew Corporate Thugz got into an altercation outside an Atlanta clothing store. Neither Gucci Mane nor Jeezy were present during the altercation.[167] On December 2, 2011, Jeezy explained how the beef originated, stating that Gucci Mane got mad at him because he would not perform \"Icy\" together; Jeezy said he could not perform the song because he was going through major throat surgery.[168]\nOn October 10, 2012, during a radio interview, Gucci Mane announced he had no more love for Jeezy due to his controversial fight with rapper Rick Ross.

His father, Robert Kardashian, died in September 2003 from esophageal cancer.[10]\nKardashian graduated from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business in 2009.[11][12]\nKardashian was a contestant on season 13 of Dancing with the Stars in 2011. He was paired with two-time champion Cheryl Burke and made it further than his sister, Kim, did during her appearance in the seventh season. Kardashian was almost eliminated in the fourth week. During the season, Kardashian became the most improved dancer,[citation needed] advancing with his partner Cheryl Burke to the finals, her fifth time doing so. The pair ended up in second place against J.R. Martinez and Karina Smirnoff.[13]\nKardashian has also taken on several business ventures working with PerfectSkin, Rival Spot, the BG5 and working on his own sock line. Kardashian was one of the final judges of Miss USA 2012.[14]\nKardashian announced in August 2012 that he would return to the University of Southern California and study law later in the year. USC's Gould School of Law, however, denied this, and stated via its Twitter account that Kardashian had not even applied to the school.[15]\nIn 2012, Kardashian participated in Fox's dating game show The Choice.[16] That same year, he launched his sock line titled Arthur George.[17][18]\nThe reality series Rob &amp; Chyna premiered on September 11, 2016.

Rowling, is a British author, film producer, television producer, screenwriter, and philanthropist. She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500\u00a0million copies,[2][3] becoming the best-selling book series in history.[4] The books are the basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts[5] and was a producer on the final films.[6] She also writes crime fiction under the name Robert Galbraith. Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.[7] The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written five books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and\u2014under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith\u2014the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series, which consists of The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015), and Lethal White (2018).[8] Rowling has lived a \"rags to riches\" life in which she progressed from living on benefits to being the world's first billionaire author.[9] She lost her billionaire status after giving away much of her earnings to charity but remains one of the wealthiest people in the world.[10] She is the UK's best-selling living author, with sales in excess of \u00a3238 million.[11] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3600\u00a0million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] Time named her a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans.[13] In October 2010, Rowling was named the \"Most Influential Woman in Britain\" by leading magazine editors.[14] She has supported multiple charities, including Comic Relief, One Parent Families, and Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain, as well as launching her own charity, Lumos. Although she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, her name, before her remarriage, was Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother.[15] She calls herself Jo.[16] Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.[17][18] During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling[19] and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.[20] Joanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965[21][22] in Yate, Gloucestershire,[23][24] the daughter of science technician Anne (n\u00e9e Volant) and Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer Peter James Rowling.[25][26] Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.[27] They married on 14 March 1965.[27] One of Rowling's maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was a Scottish man from Lamlash.[28][29] Her mother's French paternal grandfather, Louis Volant,[30] was awarded the War Cross for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during World War I. Rowling originally believed Volant had won the Legion of Honour during the war, as she said when she received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are? in which she found out it was a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard her grandfather's story of bravery and discovered that the War Cross was for \"ordinary\" soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the War Cross was \"better\" to her than the Legion of Honour.[31][32] Rowling's sister Dianne[7] was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old.[24] The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four.[33] As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories which she frequently read to her sister.[1] Aged nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales.[24] When she was a young teenager, her great-aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels.[34] Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling read all of her books.[35] Rowling has said that her teenage years were unhappy.[25] Her home life was complicated by her mother's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis[36] and a strained relationship with her father, with whom she is not on speaking terms.[25] Rowling later said that she based the character of Hermione Granger on herself when she was eleven.[37] Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.[38] Like many teenagers, she became interested in rock music, listening to the Clash,[39] the Smiths, and Siouxsie Sioux, adopting the look of the latter with back-combed hair and black eyeliner, a look that she would still sport when beginning university.[40] As a child, Rowling attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More.[41][42] Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.[43] She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother worked in the science department.[26] Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English\".[25] Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B[27] and was head girl.[25] In 1982, Rowling took the entrance exams for Oxford University but was not accepted[25] and earned a BA in French and Classics at the University of Exeter.[44][45][46] Martin Sorrell, a French professor at Exeter, remembers \"a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, gave the appearance of doing what was necessary\".[25] Rowling recalls doing little work, preferring to read Dickens and Tolkien.[25] After a year of study in Paris, Rowling graduated from Exeter in 1986.[25] In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying Classics titled \"What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled\"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[47] After working as a researcher and bilingual secretary in London for Amnesty International,[48] Rowling moved with her then boyfriend to Manchester,[24] where she worked at the Chamber of Commerce.[27] In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry \"came fully formed\" into her mind.[24][49] When she had reached her Clapham Junction flat, she began to write immediately.[24][50] In December, Rowling's mother, Anne, died after ten years suffering from multiple sclerosis.[24] Rowling was writing Harry Potter at the time and had never told her mother about it.[18] Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing,[18] and she channelled her own feelings of loss by writing about Harry's own feelings of loss in greater detail in the first book.[51] An advertisement in The Guardian[27] led Rowling to move to Porto, Portugal, to teach English as a foreign language.[7][35] She taught at night and began writing in the day while listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.[25] After 18 months in Porto, she met Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found they shared an interest in Jane Austen.[27] They married on 16 October 1992 and their child, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford), was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal.[27] Rowling had previously suffered a miscarriage.[27] The couple separated on 17 November 1993.[27][52] Biographers have suggested that Rowling suffered domestic abuse during her marriage, although the extent is unknown.[27][53] In December 1993, Rowling and her then infant daughter moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, to be near Rowling's sister[24] with three chapters of what would become Harry Potter in her suitcase.[25] Seven years after graduating from university, Rowling saw herself as a failure.[54] Her marriage had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child, but she described her failure as liberating and allowing her to focus on writing.[54] During this period, Rowling was diagnosed with clinical depression and contemplated suicide.[55] Her illness inspired the characters known as Dementors, soul-sucking creatures introduced in the third book.[56] Rowling signed up for welfare benefits, describing her economic status as being \"poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless.\"[25][54] Rowling was left in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter.[27] She obtained an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994.[27] She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University,[57] after completing her first novel while living on state benefits.[58] She wrote in many caf\u00e9s, especially Nicolson's Caf\u00e9 (owned by her brother-in-law),[59][60] and the Elephant House,[61] wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep.[24][62] In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local caf\u00e9s to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in caf\u00e9s was that taking her baby out for a walk was the best way to make her fall asleep.[62] In 1995, Rowling finished her manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which was typed on an old manual typewriter.[64] Upon the enthusiastic response of Bryony Evens, a reader who had been asked to review the book's first three chapters, the Fulham-based Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript.[27] A year later she was finally given the green light (and a \u00a31,500 advance) by editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury, a publishing house in London.[27][65] The decision to publish Rowling's book owes much to Alice Newton, the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chairman, who was given the first chapter to review by her father and immediately demanded the next.[66] Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little chance of making money in children's books.[67] Soon after, in 1997, Rowling received an \u00a38,000 grant from the Scottish Arts Council to enable her to continue writing.[68] In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued between \u00a316,000 and \u00a325,000.[69] Five months later, the book won its first award, a Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize. In February, the novel won the British Book Award for Children's Book of the Year, and later, the Children's Book Award. In early 1998, an auction was held in the United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by Scholastic Inc., for US$105,000. Rowling said that she \"nearly died\" when she heard the news.[70] In October 1998, Scholastic published Philosopher's Stone in the US under the title of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a change Rowling says she now regrets and would have fought if she had been in a better position at the time.[71] Rowling moved from her flat with the money from the Scholastic sale, into 19 Hazelbank Terrace in Edinburgh.[59] Its sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in July 1998 and again Rowling won the Smarties Prize.[72] In December 1999, the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, won the Smarties Prize, making Rowling the first person to win the award three times running.[73] She later withdrew the fourth Harry Potter novel from contention to allow other books a fair chance. In January 2000, Prisoner of Azkaban won the inaugural Whitbread Children's Book of the Year award, though it lost the Book of the Year prize to Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.[74] The fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was released simultaneously in the UK and the US on 8 July 2000 and broke sales records in both countries. 372,775 copies of the book were sold in its first day in the UK, almost equalling the number Prisoner of Azkaban sold during its first year.[75] In the US, the book sold three million copies in its first 48 hours, smashing all records.[75] Rowling said that she had had a crisis while writing the novel and had to rewrite one chapter many times to fix a problem with the plot.[76] Rowling was named Author of the Year in the 2000 British Book Awards.[77] A wait of three years occurred between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied.[78] Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, that it could have been shorter, and that she ran out of time and energy as she tried to finish it.[79] The sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 16 July 2005. It too broke all sales records, selling nine million copies in its first 24 hours of release.[80] In 2006, Half-Blood Prince received the Book of the Year prize at the British Book Awards.[72] The title of the seventh and final Harry Potter book was announced on 21 December 2006 as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[81] In February 2007 it was reported that Rowling wrote on a bust in her hotel room at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh that she had finished the seventh book in that room on 11 January 2007.[82] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:01 BST)[83] and broke its predecessor's record as the fastest-selling book of all time.[84] It sold 11\u00a0million copies in the first day of release in the United Kingdom and United States.[84] The book's last chapter was one of the earliest things she wrote in the entire series.[85] Harry Potter is now a global brand worth an estimated US$15\u00a0billion,[86] and the last four Harry Potter books have consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.[84][87] The series, totalling 4,195 pages,[88] has been translated, in whole or in part, into 65 languages.[89] The Harry Potter books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when children were thought to be abandoning books for computers and television,[90] although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.[91] In October 1998, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the first two novels for a seven-figure sum.[92] A film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released on 16 November 2001, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on 15 November 2002.[93] Both films were directed by Chris Columbus. The film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released on 4 June 2004, directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. The fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was directed by Mike Newell, and released on 18 November 2005. The film of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released on 11 July 2007.[93] David Yates directed, and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay, having taken over the position from Steve Kloves. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released on 15 July 2009.[94] David Yates directed again, and Kloves returned to write the script.[95] Warner Bros. filmed the final instalment of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in two segments, with part one being released on 19 November 2010 and part two being released on 15 July 2011. Yates directed both films.[96][97] Warner Bros. took considerable notice of Rowling's desires when drafting her contract. One of her principal stipulations was the films be shot in Britain with an all-British cast,[98] which has been generally adhered to. Rowling also demanded that Coca-Cola, the winner in the race to tie in their products to the film series, donate US$18\u00a0million to the American charity Reading Is Fundamental, as well as several community charity programs.[99] Steve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film; Rowling assisted him in the writing process, ensuring that his scripts did not contradict future books in the series.[100] She told Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) certain secrets about their characters before they were revealed in the books.[101] Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) asked her if Harry died at any point in the series; Rowling answered him by saying, \"You have a death scene\", thereby not explicitly answering the question.[102] Director Steven Spielberg was approached to direct the first film, but dropped out. The press has repeatedly claimed that Rowling played a role in his departure, but Rowling stated that she had no say in who directed the films and would not have vetoed Spielberg.[103] Rowling's first choice for the director had been Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, but Warner Bros. wanted a family-friendly film and chose Columbus.[104] Rowling had gained some creative control over the films, reviewing all the scripts[105] as well as acting as a producer on the final two-part instalment, Deathly Hallows.[106] Rowling, producers David Heyman and David Barron, along with directors David Yates, Mike Newell and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema at the 2011 British Academy Film Awards in honour of the Harry Potter film franchise.[107] In September 2013, Warner Bros. announced an \"expanded creative partnership\" with Rowling, based on a planned series of films about her character Newt Scamander, author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The first film was released in November 2016 and is set roughly 70 years before the events of the main series.[108] In 2016, it was announced that the series would consist of five films. The second, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released in November 2018.[109] Rowling scripted and co-produced both films. In 2004, Forbes named Rowling as the first person to become a US-dollar billionaire by writing books,[110] the second-richest female entertainer and the 1,062nd richest person in the world.[111] Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire.[112] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3600\u00a0million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160\u00a0million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK meant she was no longer a billionaire.[113] In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.[114] Rowling acquired the courtesy title of Laird of Killiechassie in 2001 when she purchased the historic Killiechassie House, and its surrounding estate situated on the banks of the River Tay, near Aberfeldy, in Perth and Kinross.[115][116] Rowling also owns a \u00a34.5\u00a0million Georgian house in Kensington, west London, on a street with 24-hour security.[117] In 2017, Rowling was worth an estimated \u00a3650\u00a0million according to the Sunday Times Rich List.[118] She was named the most highly paid author in the world with earnings of \u00a372\u00a0million ($95\u00a0million) a year by Forbes in 2017.[119] On 26 December 2001, Rowling married Neil Murray (born 30 June 1971), a Scottish doctor,[120] in a private ceremony at her home, Killiechassie House in Scotland.[121] Their son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born on 24 March 2003.[122] Shortly after Rowling began writing Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she ceased working on the novel to care for David in his early infancy.[123] Rowling is a friend of Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project. When Sarah Brown's son Fraser was born in 2003, Rowling was one of the first to visit her in hospital.[124] Rowling's youngest child, daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray, to whom she dedicated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was born on 23 January 2005.[125] In October 2012, a New Yorker magazine article stated that the Rowling family lived in a seventeenth-century Edinburgh house, concealed at the front by tall conifer hedges. Prior to October 2012, Rowling lived near the author Ian Rankin, who later said she was quiet and introspective, and that she seemed in her element with children.[25][126] As of June\u00a02014[update], the family resides in Scotland.[127] In July 2011, Rowling parted company with her agent, Christopher Little, moving to a new agency founded by one of his staff, Neil Blair.[25][128] On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, announced on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new book would be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012.[129] Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre,[130] the Cheltenham Literature Festival,[131] Charlie Rose[132] and the Lennoxlove Book Festival.[133] In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[134] On 3 December 2012, it was announced that the BBC would be adapting The Casual Vacancy into a television drama miniseries. Rowling's agent, Neil Blair acted as producer, through his independent production company and with Rick Senat serving as executive producer. Rowling collaborated on the adaptation, serving as an executive producer for the series. The series aired in three parts from 15 February to 1 March 2015.[135][136] In 2007, during the Edinburgh Book Festival, author Ian Rankin claimed that his wife spotted Rowling \"scribbling away\" at a detective novel in a caf\u00e9.[137] Rankin later retracted the story, claiming it was a joke,[138] but the rumour persisted, with a report in 2012 in The Guardian speculating that Rowling's next book would be a crime novel.[139] In an interview with Stephen Fry in 2005, Rowling had claimed that she would much prefer to write any subsequent books under a pseudonym, but had previously conceded to Jeremy Paxman in 2003 that if she did, the press would probably \"find out in seconds\".[140] In April 2013, Little Brown published The Cuckoo's Calling, the purported d\u00e9but novel of author Robert Galbraith, whom the publisher described as \"a former plainclothes Royal Military Police investigator who had left in 2003 to work in the civilian security industry\".[141] The novel, a detective story in which private investigator Cormoran Strike unravels the supposed suicide of a supermodel, sold 1,500 copies in hardback (although the matter was not resolved as of 21\u00a0July\u00a02013[update]; later reports stated that this number is the number of copies that were printed for the first run, while the sales total was closer to 500)[142] and received acclaim from other crime writers[141] and critics[143]\u2014a Publishers Weekly review called the book a \"stellar debut\",[144] while the Library Journal's mystery section pronounced the novel \"the debut of the month\".[145] India Knight, a novelist and columnist for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 that she had been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a d\u00e9but novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply.[146] Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation.[146][147] After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym.[147] Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%,[146] and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand.[148] As of 18\u00a0July\u00a02013[update], a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (\u00a32,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (\u00a33,950).[142] Rowling said that she had enjoyed working under a pseudonym.[149] On her Robert Galbraith website, Rowling explained that she took the name from one of her personal heroes, Robert Kennedy, and a childhood fantasy name she had invented for herself, Ella Galbraith.[150] Soon after the revelation, Brooks pondered whether Jude Callegari could have been Rowling as part of wider speculation that the entire affair had been a publicity stunt. Some also noted that many of the writers who had initially praised the book, such as Alex Gray or Val McDermid,[151] were within Rowling's circle of acquaintances; both vociferously denied any foreknowledge of Rowling's authorship.[146] Judith \"Jude\" Callegari was the best friend of the wife of Chris Gossage, a partner within Russells Solicitors, Rowling's legal representatives.[152][153] Rowling released a statement saying she was disappointed and angry;[152] Russells apologised for the leak, confirming it was not part of a marketing stunt and that \"the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he [Gossage] trusted implicitly\".[148] Russells made a donation to the Soldiers' Charity on Rowling's behalf and reimbursed her for her legal fees.[154] On 26 November 2013 the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) issued Gossage a written rebuke and \u00a31,000 fine for breaching privacy rules.[155] On 17 February 2014, Rowling announced that the second Cormoran Strike novel, named The Silkworm, would be released in June 2014. It sees Strike investigating the disappearance of a writer hated by many of his old friends for insulting them in his new novel.[156] In 2015, Rowling stated on Galbraith's website that the third Cormoran Strike novel would include \"an insane amount of planning, the most I have done for any book I have written so far. I have colour-coded spreadsheets so I can keep a track of where I am going.\"[157] On 24 April 2015, Rowling announced that work on the third book was completed. Titled Career of Evil, it was released on 20 October 2015 in the United States, and on 22 October 2015 in the United Kingdom.[158] In 2017, the BBC released a Cormoran Strike television series, starring Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike, it was picked up by HBO for distribution in the United States and Canada.[159] In March 2017, Rowling revealed the fourth novel's title via Twitter in a game of \"Hangman\" with her followers. After many failed attempts, followers finally guessed correctly. Rowling confirmed that the next novel's title is Lethal White.[160] While intended for a 2017 release, Rowling tweeted the book was taking longer than expected and would be the longest book in the series thus far.[161][162] The book was released 18 September 2018.[163] Rowling has said it is unlikely she will write any more books in the Harry Potter series.[164] In October 2007 she stated that her future work was unlikely to be in the fantasy genre.[165] On 1 October 2010, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rowling stated a new book on the saga might happen.[166] In 2007, Rowling stated that she planned to write an encyclopaedia of Harry Potter's wizarding world consisting of various unpublished material and notes.[167] Any profits from such a book would be given to charity.[168] During a news conference at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre in 2007, Rowling, when asked how the encyclopaedia was coming along, said, \"It's not coming along, and I haven't started writing it. I never said it was the next thing I'd do.\"[169] At the end of 2007, Rowling said that the encyclopaedia could take up to ten years to complete.[170] In June 2011, Rowling announced that future Harry Potter projects, and all electronic downloads, would be concentrated in a new website, called Pottermore.[171] The site includes 18,000 words of information on characters, places and objects in the Harry Potter universe.[172] In October 2015, Rowling announced via Pottermore that a two-part play she had co-authored with playwrights Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, was the \"eighth Harry Potter story\" and that it would focus on the life of Harry Potter's youngest son Albus after the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[173] On 28 October 2015, the first round of tickets went on sale and sold out in several hours.[174] In 2000, Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its annual budget of \u00a35.1\u00a0million to combat poverty and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one-parent families, and multiple sclerosis research.[175][176] Rowling, once a single parent, is now president of the charity Gingerbread (originally One Parent Families), having become their first Ambassador in 2000.[177][178] Rowling collaborated with Sarah Brown to write a book of children's stories to aid One Parent Families.[179] In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors\u00a0\u2013 cookery writer and TV presenter Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling\u00a0\u2013 to submit booklets related to their most famous works for publication.[180] Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised \u00a315.7\u00a0million for the fund. The \u00a310.8\u00a0million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis.[181] In 2002, Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping to raise money for the National Council for One Parent Families.[182] In 2005, Rowling and MEP Emma Nicholson founded the Children's High Level Group (now Lumos).[183] In January 2006, Rowling went to Bucharest to highlight the use of caged beds in mental institutions for children.[184] To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for \u00a31.95\u00a0million by online bookseller Amazon.com on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction.[185][185][186] Rowling gave away the remaining six copies to those who have a close connection with the Harry Potter books.[185] In 2008, Rowling agreed to publish the book with the proceeds going to Lumos.[126] On 1 June 2010 (International Children's Day), Lumos launched an annual initiative \u2013 Light a Birthday Candle for Lumos.[187] In November 2013, Rowling handed over all earnings from the sale of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, totalling nearly \u00a319\u00a0million.[188] In July 2012, Rowling was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London, where she read a few lines from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan as part of a tribute to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. An inflatable representation of Lord Voldemort and other children's literary characters accompanied her reading.[189] Rowling has contributed money and support for research and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward the creation of a new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.[190] In 2010, she donated another \u00a310\u00a0million to the centre,[191] and in 2019 a further \u00a315 million.[192] For unknown reasons, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers.[193] In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.[193] In May 2008, bookseller Waterstones asked Rowling and 12 other writers (Lisa Appignanesi, Margaret Atwood, Lauren Child, Sebastian Faulks, Richard Ford, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby, Doris Lessing, Michael Rosen, Axel Scheffler, Tom Stoppard and Irvine Welsh) to compose a short piece of their own choosing on a single A5 card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. The cards were collated and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.[194] On 1 and 2 August 2006, she read alongside Stephen King and John Irving at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Profits from the event were donated to the Haven Foundation, a charity that aids artists and performers left uninsurable and unable to work, and the medical NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.[195] In May 2007, Rowling pledged a donation reported as over \u00a3250,000 to a reward fund started by the tabloid News of the World for the safe return of a young British girl, Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal.[196] Rowling, along with Nelson Mandela, Al Gore, and Alan Greenspan, wrote an introduction to a collection of Gordon Brown's speeches, the proceeds of which were donated to the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory.[197] After her exposure as the true author of The Cuckoo's Calling led to a massive increase in sales, Rowling announced she would donate all her royalties to the Army Benevolent Fund, claiming she had always intended to but never expected the book to be a best-seller.[198] Rowling is a member of both English PEN and Scottish PEN. She was one of 50 authors to contribute to First Editions, Second Thoughts, a charity auction for English PEN. Each author hand annotated a first-edition copy of one of their books, in Rowling's case, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The book was the highest-selling lot of the event and fetched \u00a3150,000 ($228,600).[199] Rowling is a supporter of the Shannon Trust, which runs the Toe by Toe Reading Plan and the Shannon Reading Plan in prisons across Britain, helping and giving tutoring to prisoners who cannot read.[200] Rowling has named communist and civil rights activist Jessica Mitford as her greatest influence. She said \"Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War\", and claims what inspired her about Mitford was that she was \"incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target\".[201] Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author,[202] calling Emma her favourite book in O, The Oprah Magazine.[203] As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.[204] Rowling is known for her centre-left political views. In September 2008, on the eve of the Labour Party Conference, Rowling announced that she had donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Labour Party, and publicly endorsed Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown over Conservative challenger David Cameron, praising Labour's policies on child poverty.[205] Rowling is a close friend of Sarah Brown, wife of Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project for One Parent Families.[124] Rowling discussed the 2008 United States presidential election with the Spanish-language newspaper El Pa\u00eds in February 2008, stating that the election would have a profound effect on the rest of the world. She also said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would be \"extraordinary\" in the White House. In the same interview, Rowling identified Robert F. Kennedy as her hero.[206] In April 2010, Rowling published an article in The Times, in which she criticised Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a \u00a3150 annual tax credit: \"Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say 'it's not the money, it's the message'. When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money. When you find yourself contemplating shoplifting to get nappies, it is the money.\"[207] As a resident of Scotland, Rowling was eligible to vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, and campaigned for the \"No\" vote.[208] She donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Better Together anti-independence campaign (run by her former neighbour Alistair Darling),[127] the largest donation it had received at the time. In a blog post, Rowling explained that an open letter from Scottish medical professionals raised problems with First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for a common research funding.[127] Rowling compared some Scottish Nationalists with the Death Eaters, characters from Harry Potter who are scornful of those without pure blood.[209] On 22 October 2015 a letter was published in The Guardian signed by Rowling (along with over 150 other figures from arts and politics) opposing the cultural boycott of Israel, and announcing the creation of a network for dialogue, called Culture for Coexistence.[210] Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine.[211] In June 2016, Rowling campaigned for the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union, in the run up to the Referendum to leave the European Union, stating on her website that, \"I'm the mongrel product of this European continent and I'm an internationalist. I was raised by a Francophile mother whose family was proud of their part-French heritage ... My values are not contained or proscribed by borders. The absence of a visa when I cross the channel has symbolic value to me. I might not be in my house, but I'm still in my hometown.\"[212] Rowling expressed concern that \"racists and bigots\" were directing parts of the Leave campaign. In a blog post, she added: \"How can a retreat into selfish and insecure individualism be the right response when Europe faces genuine threats, when the bonds that tie us are so powerful, when we have come so far together? How can we hope to conquer the enormous challenges of terrorism and climate change without cooperation and collaboration?\"[213] In December 2019, Rowling faced criticism for supporting Maya Forstater, after a court ruled that Forstater's anti-transgender views were not protected beliefs.[214][215] Media outlets stated that Rowling had expressed controversial views on transgender issues prior to this incident, with some describing her as a trans-exclusionary feminist whose views are transphobic.[216][217] Over the years, some religious people, particularly Christians, have decried Rowling's books for supposedly promoting witchcraft. Rowling identifies as a Christian.[218] She once said, \"I believe in God, not magic.\"[219] Early on she felt that if readers knew of her Christian beliefs they would be able to predict plot lines of characters in her books.[220] In 2007, Rowling said she was the only one in her family who went regularly to church; she was an adherent of the Church of England. As a student she became annoyed at the \"smugness of religious people\" and attended less often. Later, she started to attend a Church of Scotland congregation at the time she was writing Harry Potter.[221][222] Her eldest daughter, Jessica, was baptised there.[218] In a 2006 interview with Tatler magazine, Rowling noted that, \"like Graham Greene, my faith is sometimes about if my faith will return. It's important to me.\"[18] She has said that she has struggled with doubt, that she believes in an afterlife,[223] and that her faith plays a part in her books.[224][225][226] In a 2012 radio interview, she said that she was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, a province of the Anglican Communion.[227] In 2015, following the referendum on same-sex marriage in Ireland, Rowling joked that if Ireland legalised same-sex marriage, Dumbledore and Gandalf could get married there.[228] The Westboro Baptist Church, in response, stated that if the two got married, they would picket. Rowling responded by saying \"Alas, the sheer awesomeness of such a union in such a place would blow your tiny bigoted minds out of your thick sloping skulls.\"[229] Rowling has had a difficult relationship with the press. She admits to being \"thin-skinned\" and dislikes the fickle nature of reporting. Rowling disputes that she is a recluse who hates to be interviewed.[230] By 2011, Rowling had taken more than 50 actions against the press.[231] In 2001, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint by Rowling over a series of unauthorised photographs of her with her daughter on the beach in Mauritius published in OK! magazine.[232] In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of David. The photo which was taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was then published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood.[17] The judgement was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.[233] Rowling particularly dislikes the British tabloid the Daily Mail, which has conducted interviews with her estranged ex-husband. As one journalist noted, \"Harry's Uncle Vernon is a grotesque philistine of violent tendencies and remarkably little brain. It is not difficult to guess which newspaper Rowling gives him to read [in Goblet of Fire].\"[234] As of January\u00a02014[update], she was seeking damages from the Mail for libel over an article about her time as a single mother.[235] Some have speculated that Rowling's fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character Rita Skeeter, a gossipy celebrity journalist who first appears in Goblet of Fire, but Rowling noted in 2000 that the character predates her rise to fame.[236] In September 2011, Rowling was named a \"core participant\" in the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press, as one of dozens of celebrities who may have been the victim of phone hacking.[237] On 24 November 2011, Rowling gave evidence before the inquiry; although she was not suspected to have been the victim of phone hacking,[238] her testimony included accounts of photographers camping on her doorstep, her fianc\u00e9 being duped into giving his home address to a journalist masquerading as a tax official,[238] her chasing a journalist a week after giving birth,[231] a journalist leaving a note inside her then-five-year-old daughter's schoolbag, and an attempt by The Sun to \"blackmail\" her into a photo opportunity in exchange for the return of a stolen manuscript.[239] Rowling claimed she had to leave her former home in Merchiston because of press intrusion.[239] In November 2012, Rowling wrote an article for The Guardian in reaction to David Cameron's decision not to implement the full recommendations of the Leveson inquiry, saying she felt \"duped and angry\".[240] In 2014, Rowling reaffirmed her support for \"Hacked Off\" and its campaign towards press self-regulation by co-signing with other British celebrities a declaration to \"[safeguard] the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.\"[241] Rowling, her publishers, and Time Warner, the owner of the rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.[242] Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date.[243] The injunction drew fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the \"right to read\".[244][245] Rowling has received honorary degrees from St Andrews University, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Napier University, the University of Exeter (which she attended),[246] the University of Aberdeen,[247][248] and Harvard University, where she spoke at the 2008 commencement ceremony.[249] In 2009 Rowling was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[31] In 2002, Rowling became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE)[250] as well a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL).[251] She was furthermore recognized as Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 2011 for services to Literature and Philanthropy.[252] Other awards include:[72]",

Rowling, is a British author, film producer, television producer, screenwriter, and philanthropist. She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500\u00a0million copies,[2][3] becoming the best-selling book series in history.[4] The books are the basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts[5] and was a producer on the final films.[6] She also writes crime fiction under the name Robert Galbraith.\nBorn in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.[7] The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written five books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and\u2014under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith\u2014the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series, which consists of The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015), and Lethal White (2018).[8]\nRowling has lived a \"rags to riches\" life in which she progressed from living on benefits to being the world's first billionaire author.[9] She lost her billionaire status after giving away much of her earnings to charity but remains one of the wealthiest people in the world.[10] She is the UK's best-selling living author, with sales in excess of \u00a3238 million.[11] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3600\u00a0million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] Time named her a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans.[13] In October 2010, Rowling was named the \"Most Influential Woman in Britain\" by leading magazine editors.[14] She has supported multiple charities, including Comic Relief, One Parent Families, and Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain, as well as launching her own charity, Lumos.\nAlthough she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, her name, before her remarriage, was Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother.[15] She calls herself Jo.[16] Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.[17][18] During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling[19] and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.[20]\nJoanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965[21][22] in Yate, Gloucestershire,[23][24] the daughter of science technician Anne (n\u00e9e Volant) and Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer Peter James Rowling.[25][26] Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.[27] They married on 14 March 1965.[27] One of Rowling's maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was a Scottish man from Lamlash.[28][29] Her mother's French paternal grandfather, Louis Volant,[30] was awarded the War Cross for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during World War I. Rowling originally believed Volant had won the Legion of Honour during the war, as she said when she received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are? in which she found out it was a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard her grandfather's story of bravery and discovered that the War Cross was for \"ordinary\" soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the War Cross was \"better\" to her than the Legion of Honour.[31][32]\nRowling's sister Dianne[7] was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old.[24] The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four.[33] As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories which she frequently read to her sister.[1] Aged nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales.[24] When she was a young teenager, her great-aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels.[34] Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling read all of her books.[35]\nRowling has said that her teenage years were unhappy.[25] Her home life was complicated by her mother's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis[36] and a strained relationship with her father, with whom she is not on speaking terms.[25] Rowling later said that she based the character of Hermione Granger on herself when she was eleven.[37] Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.[38] Like many teenagers, she became interested in rock music, listening to the Clash,[39] the Smiths, and Siouxsie Sioux, adopting the look of the latter with back-combed hair and black eyeliner, a look that she would still sport when beginning university.[40]\nAs a child, Rowling attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More.[41][42] Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.[43] She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother worked in the science department.[26] Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English\".[25] Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B[27] and was head girl.[25]\nIn 1982, Rowling took the entrance exams for Oxford University but was not accepted[25] and earned a BA in French and Classics at the University of Exeter.[44][45][46] Martin Sorrell, a French professor at Exeter, remembers \"a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, gave the appearance of doing what was necessary\".[25] Rowling recalls doing little work, preferring to read Dickens and Tolkien.[25] After a year of study in Paris, Rowling graduated from Exeter in 1986.[25] In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying Classics titled \"What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled\"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[47]\nAfter working as a researcher and bilingual secretary in London for Amnesty International,[48] Rowling moved with her then boyfriend to Manchester,[24] where she worked at the Chamber of Commerce.[27] In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry \"came fully formed\" into her mind.[24][49]\nWhen she had reached her Clapham Junction flat, she began to write immediately.[24][50] In December, Rowling's mother, Anne, died after ten years suffering from multiple sclerosis.[24] Rowling was writing Harry Potter at the time and had never told her mother about it.[18] Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing,[18] and she channelled her own feelings of loss by writing about Harry's own feelings of loss in greater detail in the first book.[51]\nAn advertisement in The Guardian[27] led Rowling to move to Porto, Portugal, to teach English as a foreign language.[7][35] She taught at night and began writing in the day while listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.[25] After 18 months in Porto, she met Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found they shared an interest in Jane Austen.[27] They married on 16 October 1992 and their child, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford), was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal.[27] Rowling had previously suffered a miscarriage.[27] The couple separated on 17 November 1993.[27][52] Biographers have suggested that Rowling suffered domestic abuse during her marriage, although the extent is unknown.[27][53] In December 1993, Rowling and her then infant daughter moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, to be near Rowling's sister[24] with three chapters of what would become Harry Potter in her suitcase.[25]\nSeven years after graduating from university, Rowling saw herself as a failure.[54] Her marriage had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child, but she described her failure as liberating and allowing her to focus on writing.[54] During this period, Rowling was diagnosed with clinical depression and contemplated suicide.[55] Her illness inspired the characters known as Dementors, soul-sucking creatures introduced in the third book.[56] Rowling signed up for welfare benefits, describing her economic status as being \"poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless.\"[25][54]\nRowling was left in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter.[27] She obtained an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994.[27] She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University,[57] after completing her first novel while living on state benefits.[58] She wrote in many caf\u00e9s, especially Nicolson's Caf\u00e9 (owned by her brother-in-law),[59][60] and the Elephant House,[61] wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep.[24][62] In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local caf\u00e9s to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in caf\u00e9s was that taking her baby out for a walk was the best way to make her fall asleep.[62]\nIn 1995, Rowling finished her manuscript for Harry Potter and the  Philosopher's Stone which was typed on an old manual typewriter.[64] Upon the enthusiastic response of Bryony Evens, a reader who had been asked to review the book's first three chapters, the Fulham-based Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript.[27] A year later she was finally given the green light (and a \u00a31,500 advance) by editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury, a publishing house in London.[27][65] The decision to publish Rowling's book owes much to Alice Newton, the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chairman, who was given the first chapter to review by her father and immediately demanded the next.[66] Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little chance of making money in children's books.[67] Soon after, in 1997, Rowling received an \u00a38,000 grant from the Scottish Arts Council to enable her to continue writing.[68]\nIn June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued between \u00a316,000 and \u00a325,000.[69] Five months later, the book won its first award, a Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize. In February, the novel won the British Book Award for Children's Book of the Year, and later, the Children's Book Award. In early 1998, an auction was held in the United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by Scholastic Inc., for US$105,000. Rowling said that she \"nearly died\" when she heard the news.[70] In October 1998, Scholastic published Philosopher's Stone in the US under the title of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a change Rowling says she now regrets and would have fought if she had been in a better position at the time.[71] Rowling moved from her flat with the money from the Scholastic sale, into 19 Hazelbank Terrace in Edinburgh.[59]\nIts sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in July 1998 and again Rowling won the Smarties Prize.[72] In December 1999, the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, won the Smarties Prize, making Rowling the first person to win the award three times running.[73] She later withdrew the fourth Harry Potter novel from contention to allow other books a fair chance. In January 2000, Prisoner of Azkaban won the inaugural Whitbread Children's Book of the Year award, though it lost the Book of the Year prize to Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.[74]\nThe fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was released simultaneously in the UK and the US on 8 July 2000 and broke sales records in both countries. 372,775 copies of the book were sold in its first day in the UK, almost equalling the number Prisoner of Azkaban sold during its first year.[75] In the US, the book sold three million copies in its first 48 hours, smashing all records.[75] Rowling said that she had had a crisis while writing the novel and had to rewrite one chapter many times to fix a problem with the plot.[76] Rowling was named Author of the Year in the 2000 British Book Awards.[77]\nA wait of three years occurred between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied.[78] Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, that it could have been shorter, and that she ran out of time and energy as she tried to finish it.[79]\nThe sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 16 July 2005. It too broke all sales records, selling nine million copies in its first 24 hours of release.[80] In 2006, Half-Blood Prince received the Book of the Year prize at the British Book Awards.[72]\nThe title of the seventh and final Harry Potter book was announced on 21 December 2006 as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[81] In February 2007 it was reported that Rowling wrote on a bust in her hotel room at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh that she had finished the seventh book in that room on 11 January 2007.[82] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:01 BST)[83] and broke its predecessor's record as the fastest-selling book of all time.[84] It sold 11\u00a0million copies in the first day of release in the United Kingdom and United States.[84] The book's last chapter was one of the earliest things she wrote in the entire series.[85]\nHarry Potter is now a global brand worth an estimated US$15\u00a0billion,[86] and the last four Harry Potter books have consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.[84][87] The series, totalling 4,195 pages,[88] has been translated, in whole or in part, into 65 languages.[89]\nThe Harry Potter books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when children were thought to be abandoning books for computers and television,[90] although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.[91]\nIn October 1998, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the first two novels for a seven-figure sum.[92] A film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released on 16 November 2001, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on 15 November 2002.[93] Both films were directed by Chris Columbus. The film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released on 4 June 2004, directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. The fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was directed by Mike Newell, and released on 18 November 2005. The film of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released on 11 July 2007.[93] David Yates directed, and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay, having taken over the position from Steve Kloves. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released on 15 July 2009.[94] David Yates directed again, and Kloves returned to write the script.[95] Warner Bros. filmed the final instalment of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in two segments, with part one being released on 19 November 2010 and part two being released on 15 July 2011. Yates directed both films.[96][97]\nWarner Bros. took considerable notice of Rowling's desires when drafting her contract. One of her principal stipulations was the films be shot in Britain with an all-British cast,[98] which has been generally adhered to. Rowling also demanded that Coca-Cola, the winner in the race to tie in their products to the film series, donate US$18\u00a0million to the American charity Reading Is Fundamental, as well as several community charity programs.[99]\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film; Rowling assisted him in the writing process, ensuring that his scripts did not contradict future books in the series.[100] She told Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) certain secrets about their characters before they were revealed in the books.[101] Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) asked her if Harry died at any point in the series; Rowling answered him by saying, \"You have a death scene\", thereby not explicitly answering the question.[102] Director Steven Spielberg was approached to direct the first film, but dropped out. The press has repeatedly claimed that Rowling played a role in his departure, but Rowling stated that she had no say in who directed the films and would not have vetoed Spielberg.[103] Rowling's first choice for the director had been Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, but Warner Bros. wanted a family-friendly film and chose Columbus.[104]\nRowling had gained some creative control over the films, reviewing all the scripts[105] as well as acting as a producer on the final two-part instalment, Deathly Hallows.[106]\nRowling, producers David Heyman and David Barron, along with directors David Yates, Mike Newell and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema at the 2011 British Academy Film Awards in honour of the Harry Potter film franchise.[107]\nIn September 2013, Warner Bros. announced an \"expanded creative partnership\" with Rowling, based on a planned series of films about her character Newt Scamander, author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The first film was released in November 2016 and is set roughly 70 years before the events of the main series.[108] In 2016, it was announced that the series would consist of five films. The second, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released in November 2018.[109] Rowling scripted and co-produced both films.\nIn 2004, Forbes named Rowling as the first person to become a US-dollar billionaire by writing books,[110] the second-richest female entertainer and the 1,062nd richest person in the world.[111] Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire.[112] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3600\u00a0million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160\u00a0million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK meant she was no longer a billionaire.[113] In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.[114]\nRowling  acquired  the  courtesy title  of  Laird  of  Killiechassie in  2001 when  she  purchased the historic Killiechassie House, and its  surrounding  estate   situated on the banks of the River Tay, near Aberfeldy, in Perth and Kinross.[115][116] Rowling also owns a \u00a34.5\u00a0million Georgian house in Kensington, west London, on a street with 24-hour security.[117]\nIn 2017, Rowling was worth an estimated \u00a3650\u00a0million according to the Sunday Times Rich List.[118] She was named the most highly paid author in the world with earnings of \u00a372\u00a0million ($95\u00a0million) a year by Forbes in 2017.[119]\nOn 26 December 2001, Rowling married Neil Murray (born 30 June 1971), a Scottish doctor,[120] in a private ceremony at her home, Killiechassie House in Scotland.[121] Their son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born on 24 March 2003.[122] Shortly after Rowling began writing Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she ceased working on the novel to care for David in his early infancy.[123]\nRowling is a friend of Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project. When Sarah Brown's son Fraser was born in 2003, Rowling was one of the first to visit her in hospital.[124] Rowling's youngest child, daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray, to whom she dedicated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was born on 23 January 2005.[125]\nIn October 2012, a New Yorker magazine article stated that the Rowling family lived in a seventeenth-century Edinburgh house, concealed at the front by tall conifer hedges. Prior to October 2012, Rowling lived near the author Ian Rankin, who later said she was quiet and introspective, and that she seemed in her element with children.[25][126] As of June\u00a02014[update], the family resides in Scotland.[127]\nIn July 2011, Rowling parted company with her agent, Christopher Little, moving to a new agency founded by one of his staff, Neil Blair.[25][128] On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, announced on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new book would be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012.[129] Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre,[130] the Cheltenham Literature Festival,[131] Charlie Rose[132] and the Lennoxlove Book Festival.[133] In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[134]\nOn 3 December 2012, it was announced that the BBC would be adapting The Casual Vacancy into a television drama miniseries. Rowling's agent, Neil Blair acted as producer, through his independent production company and with Rick Senat serving as executive producer. Rowling collaborated on the adaptation, serving as an executive producer for the series. The series aired in three parts from 15 February to 1 March 2015.[135][136]\nIn 2007, during the Edinburgh Book Festival, author Ian Rankin claimed that his wife spotted Rowling \"scribbling away\" at a detective novel in a caf\u00e9.[137] Rankin later retracted the story, claiming it was a joke,[138] but the rumour persisted, with a report in 2012 in The Guardian speculating that Rowling's next book would be a crime novel.[139] In an interview with Stephen Fry in 2005, Rowling had claimed that she would much prefer to write any subsequent books under a pseudonym, but had previously conceded to Jeremy Paxman in 2003 that if she did, the press would probably \"find out in seconds\".[140]\nIn April 2013, Little Brown published The Cuckoo's Calling, the purported d\u00e9but novel of author Robert Galbraith, whom the publisher described as \"a former plainclothes Royal Military Police investigator who had left in 2003 to work in the civilian security industry\".[141] The novel, a detective story in which private investigator Cormoran Strike unravels the supposed suicide of a supermodel, sold 1,500 copies in hardback (although the matter was not resolved as of 21\u00a0July\u00a02013[update]; later reports stated that this number is the number of copies that were printed for the first run, while the sales total was closer to 500)[142] and received acclaim from other crime writers[141] and critics[143]\u2014a Publishers Weekly review called the book a \"stellar debut\",[144] while the Library Journal's mystery section pronounced the novel \"the debut of the month\".[145]\nIndia Knight, a novelist and columnist for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 that she had been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a d\u00e9but novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply.[146] Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation.[146][147] After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym.[147] Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%,[146] and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand.[148] As of 18\u00a0July\u00a02013[update], a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (\u00a32,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (\u00a33,950).[142]\nRowling said that she had enjoyed working under a pseudonym.[149] On her Robert Galbraith website, Rowling explained that she took the name from one of her personal heroes, Robert Kennedy, and a childhood fantasy name she had invented for herself, Ella Galbraith.[150]\nSoon after the revelation, Brooks pondered whether Jude Callegari could have been Rowling as part of wider speculation that the entire affair had been a publicity stunt. Some also noted that many of the writers who had initially praised the book, such as Alex Gray or Val McDermid,[151] were within Rowling's circle of acquaintances; both vociferously denied any foreknowledge of Rowling's authorship.[146] Judith \"Jude\" Callegari was the best friend of the wife of Chris Gossage, a partner within Russells Solicitors, Rowling's legal representatives.[152][153] Rowling released a statement saying she was disappointed and angry;[152] Russells apologised for the leak, confirming it was not part of a marketing stunt and that \"the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he [Gossage] trusted implicitly\".[148] Russells made a donation to the Soldiers' Charity on Rowling's behalf and reimbursed her for her legal fees.[154] On 26 November 2013 the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) issued Gossage a written rebuke and \u00a31,000 fine for breaching privacy rules.[155]\nOn 17 February 2014, Rowling announced that the second Cormoran Strike novel, named The Silkworm, would be released in June 2014. It sees Strike investigating the disappearance of a writer hated by many of his old friends for insulting them in his new novel.[156]\nIn 2015, Rowling stated on Galbraith's website that the third Cormoran Strike novel would include \"an insane amount of planning, the most I have done for any book I have written so far. I have colour-coded spreadsheets so I can keep a track of where I am going.\"[157] On 24 April 2015, Rowling announced that work on the third book was completed. Titled Career of Evil, it was released on 20 October 2015 in the United States, and on 22 October 2015 in the United Kingdom.[158]\nIn 2017, the BBC released a Cormoran Strike television series, starring Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike, it was picked up by HBO for distribution in the United States and Canada.[159]\nIn March 2017, Rowling revealed the fourth novel's title via Twitter in a game of \"Hangman\" with her followers. After many failed attempts, followers finally guessed correctly. Rowling confirmed that the next novel's title is Lethal White.[160] While intended for a 2017 release, Rowling tweeted the book was taking longer than expected and would be the longest book in the series thus far.[161][162] The book was released 18 September 2018.[163]\nRowling has said it is unlikely she will write any more books in the Harry Potter series.[164] In October 2007 she stated that her future work was unlikely to be in the fantasy genre.[165] On 1 October 2010, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rowling stated a new book on the saga might happen.[166]\nIn 2007, Rowling stated that she planned to write an encyclopaedia of Harry Potter's wizarding world consisting of various unpublished material and notes.[167] Any profits from such a book would be given to charity.[168] During a news conference at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre in 2007, Rowling, when asked how the encyclopaedia was coming along, said, \"It's not coming along, and I haven't started writing it. I never said it was the next thing I'd do.\"[169] At the end of 2007, Rowling said that the encyclopaedia could take up to ten years to complete.[170]\nIn June 2011, Rowling announced that future Harry Potter projects, and all electronic downloads, would be concentrated in a new website, called Pottermore.[171] The site includes 18,000 words of information on characters, places and objects in the Harry Potter universe.[172]\nIn October 2015, Rowling announced via Pottermore that a two-part play she had co-authored with playwrights Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, was the \"eighth Harry Potter story\" and that it would focus on the life of Harry Potter's youngest son Albus after the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[173] On 28 October 2015, the first round of tickets went on sale and sold out in several hours.[174]\nIn 2000, Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its annual budget of \u00a35.1\u00a0million to combat poverty and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one-parent families, and multiple sclerosis research.[175][176]\nRowling, once a single parent, is now president of the charity Gingerbread (originally One Parent Families), having become their first Ambassador in 2000.[177][178] Rowling collaborated with Sarah Brown to write a book of children's stories to aid One Parent Families.[179]\nIn 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors\u00a0\u2013 cookery writer and TV presenter Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling\u00a0\u2013 to submit booklets related to their most famous works for publication.[180] Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised \u00a315.7\u00a0million for the fund. The \u00a310.8\u00a0million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis.[181] In 2002, Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping to raise money for the National Council for One Parent Families.[182]\nIn 2005, Rowling and MEP Emma Nicholson founded the Children's High Level Group (now Lumos).[183] In January 2006, Rowling went to Bucharest to highlight the use of caged beds in mental institutions for children.[184] To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for \u00a31.95\u00a0million by online bookseller Amazon.com on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction.[185][185][186] Rowling gave away the remaining six copies to those who have a close connection with the Harry Potter books.[185] In 2008, Rowling agreed to publish the book with the proceeds going to Lumos.[126] On 1 June 2010 (International Children's Day), Lumos launched an annual initiative \u2013 Light a Birthday Candle for Lumos.[187] In November 2013, Rowling handed over all earnings from the sale of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, totalling nearly \u00a319\u00a0million.[188]\nIn July 2012, Rowling was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London, where she read a few lines from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan as part of a tribute to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. An inflatable representation of Lord Voldemort and other children's literary characters accompanied her reading.[189]\nRowling has contributed money and support for research and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward the creation of a new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.[190] In 2010, she donated another \u00a310\u00a0million to the centre,[191] and in 2019 a further \u00a315 million.[192] For unknown reasons, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers.[193] In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.[193]\nIn May 2008, bookseller Waterstones asked Rowling and 12 other writers (Lisa Appignanesi, Margaret Atwood, Lauren Child, Sebastian Faulks, Richard Ford, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby, Doris Lessing, Michael Rosen, Axel Scheffler, Tom Stoppard and Irvine Welsh) to compose a short piece of their own choosing on a single A5 card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. The cards were collated and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.[194]\nOn 1 and 2 August 2006, she read alongside Stephen King and John Irving at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Profits from the event were donated to the Haven Foundation, a charity that aids artists and performers left uninsurable and unable to work, and the medical NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.[195] In May 2007, Rowling pledged a donation reported as over \u00a3250,000 to a reward fund started by the tabloid News of the World for the safe return of a young British girl, Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal.[196] Rowling, along with Nelson Mandela, Al Gore, and Alan Greenspan, wrote an introduction to a collection of Gordon Brown's speeches, the proceeds of which were donated to the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory.[197] After her exposure as the true author of The Cuckoo's Calling led to a massive increase in sales, Rowling announced she would donate all her royalties to the Army Benevolent Fund, claiming she had always intended to but never expected the book to be a best-seller.[198]\nRowling is a member of both English PEN and Scottish PEN. She was one of 50 authors to contribute to First Editions, Second Thoughts, a charity auction for English PEN. Each author hand annotated a first-edition copy of one of their books, in Rowling's case, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The book was the highest-selling lot of the event and fetched \u00a3150,000 ($228,600).[199]\nRowling is a supporter of the Shannon Trust, which runs the Toe by Toe Reading Plan and the Shannon Reading Plan in prisons across Britain, helping and giving tutoring to prisoners who cannot read.[200]\nRowling has named communist and civil rights activist Jessica Mitford as her greatest influence. She said \"Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War\", and claims what inspired her about Mitford was that she was \"incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target\".[201] Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author,[202] calling Emma her favourite book in O, The Oprah Magazine.[203] As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.[204]\nRowling is known for her centre-left political views. In September 2008, on the eve of the Labour Party Conference, Rowling announced that she had donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Labour Party, and publicly endorsed Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown over Conservative challenger David Cameron, praising Labour's policies on child poverty.[205] Rowling is a close friend of Sarah Brown, wife of Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project for One Parent Families.[124]\nRowling discussed the 2008 United States presidential election with the Spanish-language newspaper El Pa\u00eds in February 2008, stating that the election would have a profound effect on the rest of the world. She also said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would be \"extraordinary\" in the White House. In the same interview, Rowling identified Robert F. Kennedy as her hero.[206]\nIn April 2010, Rowling published an article in The Times, in which she criticised Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a \u00a3150 annual tax credit: \"Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say 'it's not the money, it's the message'. When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money. When you find yourself contemplating shoplifting to get nappies, it is the money.\"[207]\nAs a resident of Scotland, Rowling was eligible to vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, and campaigned for the \"No\" vote.[208] She donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Better Together anti-independence campaign (run by her former neighbour Alistair Darling),[127] the largest donation it had received at the time. In a blog post, Rowling explained that an open letter from Scottish medical professionals raised problems with First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for a common research funding.[127] Rowling compared some Scottish Nationalists with the Death Eaters, characters from Harry Potter who are scornful of those without pure blood.[209]\nOn 22 October 2015 a letter was published in The Guardian signed by Rowling (along with over 150 other figures from arts and politics) opposing the cultural boycott of Israel, and announcing the creation of a network for dialogue, called Culture for Coexistence.[210] Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine.[211]\nIn June 2016, Rowling campaigned for the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union, in the run up to the Referendum to leave the European Union, stating on her website that, \"I'm the mongrel product of this European continent and I'm an internationalist. I was raised by a Francophile mother whose family was proud of their part-French heritage ... My values are not contained or proscribed by borders. The absence of a visa when I cross the channel has symbolic value to me. I might not be in my house, but I'm still in my hometown.\"[212] Rowling expressed concern that \"racists and bigots\" were directing parts of the Leave campaign. In a blog post, she added: \"How can a retreat into selfish and insecure individualism be the right response when Europe faces genuine threats, when the bonds that tie us are so powerful, when we have come so far together? How can we hope to conquer the enormous challenges of terrorism and climate change without cooperation and collaboration?\"[213]\nIn December 2019, Rowling faced criticism for supporting Maya Forstater, after a court ruled that Forstater's anti-transgender views were not protected beliefs.[214][215] Media outlets stated that Rowling had expressed controversial views on transgender issues prior to this incident, with some describing her as a trans-exclusionary feminist whose views are transphobic.[216][217]\nOver the years, some religious people, particularly Christians, have decried Rowling's books for supposedly promoting witchcraft. Rowling identifies as a Christian.[218] She once said, \"I believe in God, not magic.\"[219] Early on she felt that if readers knew of her Christian beliefs they would be able to predict plot lines of characters in her books.[220]\nIn 2007, Rowling said she was the only one in her family who went regularly to church; she was an adherent of the Church of England. As a student she became annoyed at the \"smugness of religious people\" and attended less often. Later, she started to attend a Church of Scotland congregation at the time she was writing Harry Potter.[221][222] Her eldest daughter, Jessica, was baptised there.[218]\nIn a 2006 interview with Tatler magazine, Rowling noted that, \"like Graham Greene, my faith is sometimes about if my faith will return. It's important to me.\"[18] She has said that she has struggled with doubt, that she believes in an afterlife,[223] and that her faith plays a part in her books.[224][225][226] In a 2012 radio interview, she said that she was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, a province of the Anglican Communion.[227]\nIn 2015, following the referendum on same-sex marriage in Ireland, Rowling joked that if Ireland legalised same-sex marriage, Dumbledore and Gandalf could get married there.[228] The Westboro Baptist Church, in response, stated that if the two got married, they would picket. Rowling responded by saying \"Alas, the sheer awesomeness of such a union in such a place would blow your tiny bigoted minds out of your thick sloping skulls.\"[229]\nRowling has had a difficult relationship with the press. She admits to being \"thin-skinned\" and dislikes the fickle nature of reporting. Rowling disputes that she is a recluse who hates to be interviewed.[230]\nBy 2011, Rowling had taken more than 50 actions against the press.[231] In 2001, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint by Rowling over a series of unauthorised photographs of her with her daughter on the beach in Mauritius published in OK! magazine.[232] In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of David. The photo which was taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was then published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood.[17] The judgement was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.[233]\nRowling particularly dislikes the British tabloid the Daily Mail, which has conducted interviews with her estranged ex-husband. As one journalist noted, \"Harry's Uncle Vernon is a grotesque philistine of violent tendencies and remarkably little brain. It is not difficult to guess which newspaper Rowling gives him to read [in Goblet of Fire].\"[234] As of January\u00a02014[update], she was seeking damages from the Mail for libel over an article about her time as a single mother.[235] Some have speculated that Rowling's fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character Rita Skeeter, a gossipy celebrity journalist who first appears in Goblet of Fire, but Rowling noted in 2000 that the character predates her rise to fame.[236]\nIn September 2011, Rowling was named a \"core participant\" in the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press, as one of dozens of celebrities who may have been the victim of phone hacking.[237] On 24 November 2011, Rowling gave evidence before the inquiry; although she was not suspected to have been the victim of phone hacking,[238] her testimony included accounts of photographers camping on her doorstep, her fianc\u00e9 being duped into giving his home address to a journalist masquerading as a tax official,[238] her chasing a journalist a week after giving birth,[231] a journalist leaving a note inside her then-five-year-old daughter's schoolbag, and an attempt by The Sun to \"blackmail\" her into a photo opportunity in exchange for the return of a stolen manuscript.[239] Rowling claimed she had to leave her former home in Merchiston because of press intrusion.[239] In November 2012, Rowling wrote an article for The Guardian in reaction to David Cameron's decision not to implement the full recommendations of the Leveson inquiry, saying she felt \"duped and angry\".[240]\nIn 2014, Rowling reaffirmed her support for \"Hacked Off\" and its campaign towards press self-regulation by co-signing with other British celebrities a declaration to \"[safeguard] the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.\"[241]\nRowling, her publishers, and Time Warner, the owner of the rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.[242]\nAnother area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date.[243] The injunction drew fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the \"right to read\".[244][245]\nRowling has received honorary degrees from St Andrews University, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Napier University, the University of Exeter (which she attended),[246] the University of Aberdeen,[247][248] and Harvard University, where she spoke at the 2008 commencement ceremony.[249] In 2009 Rowling was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[31] In 2002, Rowling became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE)[250] as well a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL).[251] She was furthermore recognized as Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 2011 for services to Literature and Philanthropy.[252]\nOther awards include:[72]\n</body></html>"

In 1991, at the age of seven, she moved from Soviet Ukraine to the United States with her family. After being enrolled in acting classes as an after-school activity, she was soon discovered by an agent. She appeared in several television series and commercials, before landing her first significant role at age 14, playing Jackie Burkhart on the television series That '70s Show (1998\u20132006). Since 1999, she has voiced Meg Griffin on the animated series Family Guy. Kunis's breakout film role came in 2008,[1][2] playing Rachel in the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She gained further critical acclaim and accolades for her performance in the psychological thriller Black Swan (2010), for which she received the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress, and nominations for the SAG Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other major films include the action films Max Payne (2008) and The Book of Eli (2010), the romantic comedy Friends with Benefits (2011), the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) as the Wicked Witch of the West, and the comedies Ted (2012), Bad Moms (2016) and its sequel (2017). Milena Markovna Kunis was born on August 14, 1983,[3] in Chernivtsi, Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union.[4] Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a mechanical engineer who works as a cab driver.[5] Kunis has an elder brother, Michael.[6][7] Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian.[8] She stated in 2011 that her parents had \"amazing jobs\", and that she \"was very lucky\" and the family was \"not poor\"; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw \"no future\" there for Mila and her brother.[9] In 1991, when she was seven years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, with $250. \"That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA.\"[9] Kunis comes from a Jewish family and has cited antisemitism in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States.[10][11][12][13][14][15] She has stated that her parents \"raised [her] Jewish as much as they could\", although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union.[16][11] On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: \"I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States.\"[17] In Los Angeles she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School.[18] She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming That '70s Show.[19] She briefly attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES), but when that school proved to be insufficiently flexible about her acting commitments, she transferred to Fairfax High School,[20] from which she graduated in 2001.[14] She briefly attended UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.[6][21] At age nine, Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios, where she met Susan Curtis, who would become her manager.[22][23] On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial.[24] Shortly after, she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line.[25][26] Her first television roles took place in 1994, first appearing on Days of Our Lives,[27][28] and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on Baywatch.[citation needed] She had a minor role on 7th Heaven[19] and supporting roles in Santa with Muscles, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, and the Angelina Jolie film Gia, as the young Gia Carangi.[6] At the age of 10, Kunis auditioned for but failed to get the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly.[29] Instead, she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl.[20] In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role.[23] That '70s Show ran for eight seasons.[30] She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.[31] In 1999, Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy,[32] created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show.[33] When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.[33] MacFarlane added: \"What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but there was something about Mila\u00a0\u2013 something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work.\"[34] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007.[35] She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as \"the scapegoat.\"[36] In 2001, she appeared in Get Over It opposite Kirsten Dunst. She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was poorly reviewed by critics,[37] and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film.[38] In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, it did not have a theatrical release until 2007.[39] Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes.[40] DVD talk concluded that \"fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place\".[41] In 2005, Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in Moving McAllister, which was not released theatrically until 2007.[42] The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters.[43][44] She followed up with After Sex starring alongside Zoe Saldana, who had also appeared in Get Over It.[45] In October 2006, she began filming Boot Camp (originally titled Straight Edge).[46] The film was not released in theaters in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009.[47] Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, co-produced by Judd Apatow. The role, which she won after unsuccessfully auditioning for Knocked Up,[2] entailed improvization on her part.[48] The film garnered positive reviews,[49] and was a commercial success, grossing $105\u00a0million worldwide.[50] Kunis's performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised her \"fresh beauty and focused energy\",[51] while James Berardinelli wrote that she is \"adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing\".[52] She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award.[53] In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from That '70s Show.[2] Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role.[54] Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85\u00a0million worldwide[55] but was poorly reviewed by critics,[56] with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast.[57][58] Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was \"horribly miscast as some sort of undersized, warble-voiced crime boss\".[59] Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, \"Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park.\"[54] She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.[60] In 2009, she appeared in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews,[61] and grossed $10.8\u00a0million at the box office.[62] Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis \"brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility.\"[63] Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: \"As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world.\"[64] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: \"I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic.\" Kunis herself stated that \"I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production\u2013 like craft service, or, say, acting.\"[65] In 2010, she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film The Book of Eli. Although the film received mixed reviews,[66] it performed well at the box office, grossing over $157\u00a0million worldwide.[67] Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis's performance, calling it a \"particularly strong piece of work\".[68] Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of Boxoffice magazine, who wrote that she's \"ideally cast in the key female role\"[69] Even reviewers who didn't necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that \"the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts\",[70] and Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, who wrote that she \"generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who's not always in need of rescuing.\"[71] Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of USA Today felt she was miscast, noting that \"she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial\".[72][73][74] Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance.[75][76] Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film Date Night, starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell.[77] She garnered several positive reviews for her performance.[78][79][80] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it \"a shot in the arm.\"[81] Kunis was nominated for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film Black Swan. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and on the recommendation of co-star and close friend Natalie Portman.[29][82] She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20\u00a0pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week.[1][83][84] During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder.[85] Black Swan received widespread acclaim from critics[86] and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.[87] The film grossed over $106.9\u00a0million in the United States and Canada[88] while grossing over $329\u00a0million worldwide.[89] Reviews of Kunis's performance were positive,[90][91][92] with Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stating, \"Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness.\"[93] Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, \"it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness.\"[94] Kunis's performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival,[95] and earned her Golden Globe Award[96] and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress.[97] At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.[98] Kunis was cast alongside Justin Timberlake in the 2011 romantic comedy Friends with Benefits.[99] Director Will Gluck stated that he wrote the story with Kunis and Timberlake in mind.[100] Friends with Benefits achieved success at the box office, grossing over $149\u00a0million worldwide,[101] and received mostly positive reviews with critics praising the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake.[102] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that \"Ms. Kunis is fast proving that she's a gift that keeps giving to mainstream romantic comedy\" and \"her energy is so invigorating and expansive and her presence so vibrant that she fills the screen\".[103] In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in Ted, her most commercially successful film to date. The film was directed and co-written by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis too young for the role. However, the film remained in development for several years and when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her.[104] Ted has received generally positive reviews from critics[105] and was a commercial success, grossing $549\u00a0million worldwide.[106] Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Kunis \"brings some lovely subtle grace notes to a role that easily could have just been 'the pushy girlfriend'\".[107] In 2013, Kunis played Theodora, the youngest of three witches, opposite James Franco, in the Walt Disney Pictures' prequel, Oz the Great and Powerful.[108][109] She dedicated her performance in the film to Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film.[110] The film, and Kunis's performance, received mixed reviews from critics.[111] Kim Newman of Empire Magazine wrote that Kunis \"walks away with the honours as the wavering witch Theodora, whose heartbreak brings another, less-expected depth to this 3D spectacle\".[112] In contrast, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter found Kunis's performance to be uncertain as her character seemed to be in a state of limbo.[113] Oz the Great and Powerful was a commercial success, grossing over $493\u00a0million worldwide.[114] Also in 2013 Kunis co-starred in the crime thriller Blood Ties with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard.[115] The film premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and had a limited release in the United States in 2014.[116] Blood Ties received mixed reviews.[117] Kunis was also cast in the comedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, alongside Robin Williams and Peter Dinklage.[118] The film had a limited theatrical and VOD release[119] and received poor reviews.[120] The Paul Haggis-directed film Third Person co-starring with Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde and James Franco[121] premiered at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival[122] and had a limited release in 2014, but also received mostly negative reviews.[123] Kunis' performance was praised by some critics; Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her role gives her \"enormous room to express her talent\" and she \"gives her story a shot of raw intensity\".[124] In October 2014 it was announced Kunis, along with her partners, had launched a new production company called Orchard Farm Productions. The company has a first-look deal with ABC Studios, where the company is based. Under the agreement, the team will develop and produce TV projects for broadcast and cable.[125] In 2015, Kunis co-starred with Channing Tatum in the science fiction film Jupiter Ascending, directed by the Wachowskis.[126][127] While the film grossed over $183.9\u00a0million on a $176\u00a0million budget,[128] it received mostly negative reviews, with a consensus that the production was \"narratively befuddled\" and a \"visually thrilling misfire\".[129] Kunis co-starred with Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate in the comedy Bad Moms, which was released July 29, 2016.[130] It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and humor, though did not feel it could \"take full advantage of its assets\".[131] Chris Nashawaty from Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"Kunis manages to be both sympathetic and funny, and she has crack comedic timing\".[132] The film went on to earn more than $183.9\u00a0million with a budget of $20\u00a0million.[133] Following the financial success of Bad Moms, STX Entertainment reunited Kunis with her co-stars Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn for a sequel, A Bad Moms Christmas, which was released on November 1, 2017.[134][135] It went on to receive mixed reviews[136] and gross over $130 million worldwide with a budget of $28\u00a0million.[137] In 2018 Kunis co-starred with Kate McKinnon in the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me. The film received mixed reviews[138] and went on to gross over $75 million worldwide with a budget of $40 million.[139] Kunis joined the cast on a couple of new projects. One is co-starring with Glenn Close in the film Four Good Days. Principle photography began in September 2019 in Los Angeles[140] and made its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020.[141] The other film titled, Breaking News in Yuba County also co-stars Allison Janney and Regina Hall and was filmed in Mississippi.[142] In 2007, Kunis participated in a video for the website Funny or Die appearing alongside James Franco. The video was a parody of the MTV show The Hills and was a huge success for the website, with 2.4\u00a0million views over the next ten years.[143] Shawn Levy, director of Date Night, stated that part of what made him decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the Funny or Die video.[144] In December 2008, Kunis was featured in Gap's \"Shine Your Own Star\" Christmas campaign.[145] In 2010, she was featured in the \"Women We Love\" segment in Esquire with an accompanied video.[146] Kunis was among several female stars photographed by Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams in conjunction with the Calvin Klein Collections for a feature titled American Women 2010, with the proceeds from the photographs donated to the NYC AIDS foundation.[147] During the summer of 2010 Kunis served with Randy Jackson as the Master of Ceremonies for the 9th Annual Chrysalis Foundation Benefit. The Chrysalis Foundation is a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization formed to help economically disadvantaged and homeless individuals to become self-sufficient through employment opportunities.[148] GQ magazine named Kunis the Knockout of the Year for 2011,[149] with Men's Health naming her one of the \"100 Hottest Women of All-Time\".[150] FHM magazine ranked her number 9 on its 2012 Hot 100 list,[151] but she reached number 1 on their 2013 \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\" list,[152][153] which brought to an end a four-year run by British women.[154] Prior to this in 2008 Kunis stated, \"You've got to base your career on something other than being FHM's top 100 number one girl. Your looks are going to die out, and then what's going to be left?\"[17] Maxim has consistently ranked Kunis on its Hot 100 list, reaching a ranking of number 5 in both 2009 and 2011[155] and number 3 in 2012.[156][157] Esquire magazine named her 2012's Sexiest Woman Alive.[158] She ranked #2 on AskMen's list of Top 99 Women for 2013, behind only Jennifer Lawrence.[159] In 2013, she responded to those lists: \"All I can say is, I feel honored to be considered sexy.\"[160] Christian Dior signed Kunis in 2012 to be the face of its Spring fashion campaign.[161][162] In February 2013, she was named Gemfields global brand ambassador and the face of their advertising campaign.[163] Gemfields is a luxury company that produces emeralds, rubies, and amethysts. She visited Gemfields' mine in Zambia.[164] Kunis appeared wearing Gemfields's Rubies for the world premiere of Jupiter Ascending.[165] In 2013, she appeared in Forbes list of 100 powerful celebrities, ranking #89 on the basis of five criteria (Money, TV/Radio, Press, Social, and Marketability), with her highest ranking as #14 in marketability. She earned $11\u00a0million for the year ending in June 2013.[166] In 2014, Kunis appeared in a range of global advertising for Beam, Inc. (makers of Jim Beam bourbon).[167] Her intent to donate to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's name received praise but also calls for a boycott of Jim Beam.[168] On September 14, 2011, the FBI announced it was investigating the alleged hacking of Kunis's cellphone and email accounts, along with those of other celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson and Vanessa Hudgens.[169][170][171] Christopher Chaney from Jacksonville, Florida, later pleaded guilty in federal court to nine counts of computer hacking.[172] In November 2011, Kunis was escorted by Sgt. Scott Moore to a United States Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina. Kunis had accepted Moore's invitation in July after he posted it as a YouTube video while serving with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, in Afghanistan's Helmand province. The event celebrated the Marine Corps' 236th anniversary.[173] Kunis is a supporter of the Democratic Party and Barack Obama.[174] In a 2012 interview, she criticized the Republican Party, saying: \"The way that Republicans attack women is so offensive to me. And the way they talk about religion is offensive. I may not be a practicing Jew, but why we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?\"[158] In January 2011, she revealed her struggle with chronic iritis that had caused temporary blindness in one eye. Some months earlier she had had surgery that corrected the problem.[175] Kunis also has heterochromia iridum, a condition in which the irises are different colors. Her left eye is brown, while her right eye is green.[152][176] Kunis began dating actor Macaulay Culkin in 2002.[177][178] During their relationship, there were rumors of the couple getting married, but Kunis denied them.[179] In an interview with BlackBook magazine, Kunis stated that marriage is \"not something that's important to me\".[180] Kunis said she tried her best to protect her and Culkin's privacy, noting that \"We don't talk about it to the press. It's already more high profile than I want it to be.\"[181] When asked if it was difficult to stay out of the tabloids and press, Kunis responded: \"I keep my personal life as personal as I physically, mentally, possibly can.\" Asked if that is difficult she said, \"I don't care. I will go to my grave trying. It is hard, but I'll end up going to a bar that's a hole in the wall. I won't go to the 'it's-happening' place.\"[182] On January 3, 2011, Kunis' publicist confirmed reports that Kunis and Culkin had ended their relationship, saying, \"The split was amicable, and they remain close friends.\"[177] Kunis began dating her former That '70s Show co-star Ashton Kutcher in April 2012.[183][184] They became engaged in February 2014,[185] and married during the first weekend of July 2015 in Oak Glen, California.[186] The couple have two children: a daughter born in October 2014[187][188] and a son born in November 2016.[189]",

In 1991, at the age of seven, she moved from Soviet Ukraine to the United States with her family. After being enrolled in acting classes as an after-school activity, she was soon discovered by an agent. She appeared in several television series and commercials, before landing her first significant role at age 14, playing Jackie Burkhart on the television series That '70s Show (1998\u20132006). Since 1999, she has voiced Meg Griffin on the animated series Family Guy.\nKunis's breakout film role came in 2008,[1][2] playing Rachel in the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She gained further critical acclaim and accolades for her performance in the psychological thriller Black Swan (2010), for which she received the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress, and nominations for the SAG Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other major films include the action films Max Payne (2008) and The Book of Eli (2010), the romantic comedy Friends with Benefits (2011), the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) as the Wicked Witch of the West, and the comedies Ted (2012), Bad Moms (2016) and its sequel (2017).\nMilena Markovna Kunis was born on August 14, 1983,[3] in Chernivtsi, Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union.[4] Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a mechanical engineer who works as a cab driver.[5] Kunis has an elder brother, Michael.[6][7] Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian.[8] She stated in 2011 that her parents had \"amazing jobs\", and that she \"was very lucky\" and the family was \"not poor\"; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw \"no future\" there for Mila and her brother.[9] In 1991, when she was seven years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, with $250. \"That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA.\"[9]\nKunis comes from a Jewish family and has cited antisemitism in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States.[10][11][12][13][14][15] She has stated that her parents \"raised [her] Jewish as much as they could\", although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union.[16][11] On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: \"I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States.\"[17]\nIn Los Angeles she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School.[18] She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming That '70s Show.[19] She briefly attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES), but when that school proved to be insufficiently flexible about her acting commitments, she transferred to Fairfax High School,[20] from which she graduated in 2001.[14] She briefly attended UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.[6][21]\nAt age nine, Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios, where she met Susan Curtis, who would become her manager.[22][23] On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial.[24] Shortly after, she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line.[25][26] Her first television roles took place in 1994, first appearing on Days of Our Lives,[27][28] and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on Baywatch.[citation needed] She had a minor role on 7th Heaven[19] and supporting roles in Santa with Muscles, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, and the Angelina Jolie film Gia, as the young Gia Carangi.[6]\nAt the age of 10, Kunis auditioned for but failed to get the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly.[29] Instead, she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl.[20] In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role.[23] That '70s Show ran for eight seasons.[30] She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.[31]\nIn 1999, Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy,[32] created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show.[33] When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.[33] MacFarlane added: \"What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but there was something about Mila\u00a0\u2013 something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work.\"[34] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007.[35] She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as \"the scapegoat.\"[36]\nIn 2001, she appeared in Get Over It opposite Kirsten Dunst. She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was poorly reviewed by critics,[37] and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film.[38] In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, it did not have a theatrical release until 2007.[39] Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes.[40] DVD talk concluded that \"fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place\".[41]\nIn 2005, Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in Moving McAllister, which was not released theatrically until 2007.[42] The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters.[43][44] She followed up with After Sex starring alongside Zoe Saldana, who had also appeared in Get Over It.[45] In October 2006, she began filming Boot Camp (originally titled Straight Edge).[46] The film was not released in theaters in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009.[47]\nKunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, co-produced by Judd Apatow. The role, which she won after unsuccessfully auditioning for Knocked Up,[2] entailed improvization on her part.[48] The film garnered positive reviews,[49] and was a commercial success, grossing $105\u00a0million worldwide.[50] Kunis's performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised her \"fresh beauty and focused energy\",[51] while James Berardinelli wrote that she is \"adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing\".[52] She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award.[53] In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from That '70s Show.[2]\nAlso in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role.[54] Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85\u00a0million worldwide[55] but was poorly reviewed by critics,[56] with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast.[57][58] Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was \"horribly miscast as some sort of undersized, warble-voiced crime boss\".[59] Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, \"Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park.\"[54] She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.[60]\nIn 2009, she appeared in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews,[61] and grossed $10.8\u00a0million at the box office.[62] Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis \"brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility.\"[63] Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: \"As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world.\"[64] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: \"I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic.\" Kunis herself stated that \"I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production\u2013 like craft service, or, say, acting.\"[65]\nIn 2010, she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film The Book of Eli. Although the film received mixed reviews,[66] it performed well at the box office, grossing over $157\u00a0million worldwide.[67] Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis's performance, calling it a \"particularly strong piece of work\".[68] Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of Boxoffice magazine, who wrote that she's \"ideally cast in the key female role\"[69] Even reviewers who didn't necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that \"the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts\",[70] and Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, who wrote that she \"generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who's not always in need of rescuing.\"[71] Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of USA Today felt she was miscast, noting that \"she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial\".[72][73][74] Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance.[75][76] Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film Date Night, starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell.[77] She garnered several positive reviews for her performance.[78][79][80] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it \"a shot in the arm.\"[81]\nKunis was nominated for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film Black Swan. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and on the recommendation of co-star and close friend Natalie Portman.[29][82] She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20\u00a0pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week.[1][83][84] During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder.[85] Black Swan received widespread acclaim from critics[86] and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.[87] The film grossed over $106.9\u00a0million in the United States and Canada[88] while grossing over $329\u00a0million worldwide.[89] Reviews of Kunis's performance were positive,[90][91][92] with Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stating, \"Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness.\"[93] Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, \"it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness.\"[94] Kunis's performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival,[95] and earned her Golden Globe Award[96] and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress.[97] At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.[98]\nKunis was cast alongside Justin Timberlake in the 2011 romantic comedy Friends with Benefits.[99] Director Will Gluck stated that he wrote the story with Kunis and Timberlake in mind.[100] Friends with Benefits achieved success at the box office, grossing over $149\u00a0million worldwide,[101] and received mostly positive reviews with critics praising the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake.[102] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that \"Ms. Kunis is fast proving that she's a gift that keeps giving to mainstream romantic comedy\" and \"her energy is so invigorating and expansive and her presence so vibrant that she fills the screen\".[103]\nIn 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in Ted, her most commercially successful film to date. The film was directed and co-written by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis too young for the role. However, the film remained in development for several years and when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her.[104] Ted has received generally positive reviews from critics[105] and was a commercial success, grossing $549\u00a0million worldwide.[106] Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Kunis \"brings some lovely subtle grace notes to a role that easily could have just been 'the pushy girlfriend'\".[107]\nIn 2013, Kunis played Theodora, the youngest of three witches, opposite James Franco, in the Walt Disney Pictures' prequel, Oz the Great and Powerful.[108][109] She dedicated her performance in the film to Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film.[110] The film, and Kunis's performance, received mixed reviews from critics.[111] Kim Newman of Empire Magazine wrote that Kunis \"walks away with the honours as the wavering witch Theodora, whose heartbreak brings another, less-expected depth to this 3D spectacle\".[112] In contrast, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter found Kunis's performance to be uncertain as her character seemed to be in a state of limbo.[113] Oz the Great and Powerful was a commercial success, grossing over $493\u00a0million worldwide.[114]\nAlso in 2013 Kunis co-starred in the crime thriller Blood Ties with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard.[115] The film premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and had a limited release in the United States in 2014.[116] Blood Ties received mixed reviews.[117] Kunis was also cast in the comedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, alongside Robin Williams and Peter Dinklage.[118] The film had a limited theatrical and VOD release[119] and received poor reviews.[120] The Paul Haggis-directed film Third Person co-starring with Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde and James Franco[121] premiered at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival[122] and had a limited release in 2014, but also received mostly negative reviews.[123] Kunis' performance was praised by some critics; Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her role gives her \"enormous room to express her talent\" and she \"gives her story a shot of raw intensity\".[124]\nIn October 2014 it was announced Kunis, along with her partners, had launched a new production company called Orchard Farm Productions. The company has a first-look deal with ABC Studios, where the company is based. Under the agreement, the team will develop and produce TV projects for broadcast and cable.[125]\nIn 2015, Kunis co-starred with Channing Tatum in the science fiction film Jupiter Ascending, directed by the Wachowskis.[126][127] While the film grossed over $183.9\u00a0million on a $176\u00a0million budget,[128] it received mostly negative reviews, with a consensus that the production was \"narratively befuddled\" and a \"visually thrilling misfire\".[129]\nKunis co-starred with Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate in the comedy Bad Moms, which was released July 29, 2016.[130] It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and humor, though did not feel it could \"take full advantage of its assets\".[131] Chris Nashawaty from Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"Kunis manages to be both sympathetic and funny, and she has crack comedic timing\".[132] The film went on to earn more than $183.9\u00a0million with a budget of $20\u00a0million.[133] Following the financial success of Bad Moms, STX Entertainment reunited Kunis with her co-stars Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn for a sequel, A Bad Moms Christmas, which was released on November 1, 2017.[134][135] It went on to receive mixed reviews[136] and gross over $130 million worldwide with a budget of $28\u00a0million.[137]\nIn 2018 Kunis co-starred with Kate McKinnon in the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me. The film received mixed reviews[138] and went on to gross over $75 million worldwide with a budget of $40 million.[139]\nKunis joined the cast on a couple of new projects.  One is co-starring with Glenn Close in the film Four Good Days. Principle photography began in September 2019 in Los Angeles[140] and made its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020.[141] The other film titled, Breaking News in Yuba County also co-stars Allison Janney and Regina Hall and was filmed in Mississippi.[142]\nIn 2007, Kunis participated in a video for the website Funny or Die appearing alongside James Franco. The video was a parody of the MTV show The Hills and was a huge success for the website, with 2.4\u00a0million views over the next ten years.[143] Shawn Levy, director of Date Night, stated that part of what made him decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the Funny or Die video.[144] In December 2008, Kunis was featured in Gap's \"Shine Your Own Star\" Christmas campaign.[145]\nIn 2010, she was featured in the \"Women We Love\" segment in Esquire with an accompanied video.[146] Kunis was among several female stars photographed by Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams in conjunction with the Calvin Klein Collections for a feature titled American Women 2010, with the proceeds from the photographs donated to the NYC AIDS foundation.[147] During the summer of 2010 Kunis served with Randy Jackson as the Master of Ceremonies for the 9th Annual Chrysalis Foundation Benefit. The Chrysalis Foundation is a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization formed to help economically disadvantaged and homeless individuals to become self-sufficient through employment opportunities.[148]\nGQ magazine named Kunis the Knockout of the Year for 2011,[149] with Men's Health naming her one of the \"100 Hottest Women of All-Time\".[150] FHM magazine ranked her number 9 on its 2012 Hot 100 list,[151] but she reached number 1 on their 2013 \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\" list,[152][153] which brought to an end a four-year run by British women.[154]\nPrior to this in 2008 Kunis stated, \"You've got to base your career on something other than being FHM's top 100 number one girl. Your looks are going to die out, and then what's going to be left?\"[17] Maxim has consistently ranked Kunis on its Hot 100 list, reaching a ranking of number 5 in both 2009 and 2011[155] and number 3 in 2012.[156][157] Esquire magazine named her 2012's Sexiest Woman Alive.[158] She ranked #2 on AskMen's list of Top 99 Women for 2013, behind only Jennifer Lawrence.[159] In 2013, she responded to those lists: \"All I can say is, I feel honored to be considered sexy.\"[160]\nChristian Dior signed Kunis in 2012 to be the face of its Spring fashion campaign.[161][162] In February 2013, she was named Gemfields global brand ambassador and the face of their advertising campaign.[163] Gemfields is a luxury company that produces emeralds, rubies, and amethysts. She visited Gemfields' mine in Zambia.[164] Kunis appeared wearing Gemfields's Rubies for the world premiere of Jupiter Ascending.[165]\nIn 2013, she appeared in Forbes list of 100 powerful celebrities, ranking #89 on the basis of five criteria (Money, TV/Radio, Press, Social, and Marketability), with her highest ranking as #14 in marketability. She earned $11\u00a0million for the year ending in June 2013.[166]\nIn 2014, Kunis appeared in a range of global advertising for Beam, Inc. (makers of Jim Beam bourbon).[167] Her intent to donate to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's name received praise but also calls for a boycott of Jim Beam.[168]\nOn September 14, 2011, the FBI announced it was investigating the alleged hacking of Kunis's cellphone and email accounts, along with those of other celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson and Vanessa Hudgens.[169][170][171] Christopher Chaney from Jacksonville, Florida, later pleaded guilty in federal court to nine counts of computer hacking.[172]\nIn November 2011, Kunis was escorted by Sgt. Scott Moore to a United States Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina. Kunis had accepted Moore's invitation in July after he posted it as a YouTube video while serving with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, in Afghanistan's Helmand province. The event celebrated the Marine Corps' 236th anniversary.[173]\nKunis is a supporter of the Democratic Party and Barack Obama.[174] In a 2012 interview, she criticized the Republican Party, saying: \"The way that Republicans attack women is so offensive to me. And the way they talk about religion is offensive. I may not be a practicing Jew, but why we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?\"[158]\nIn January 2011, she revealed her struggle with chronic iritis that had caused temporary blindness in one eye.

                "text": "no title\n\nDavid William Donald Cameron (born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Witney from 2001 to 2016 and leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016. He identifies as a one-nation conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies. Born in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, and succeeded Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats \u2013 the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s.[1] His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare.[2] It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales. Internationally, his government intervened militarily in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority in the 2015 general election he remained as Prime Minister, this time leading a Conservative-only government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote,[3] he resigned to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May.[3][4] Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for decreasing the United Kingdom's national deficit. However, he has been the target of criticism surrounding his decision to hold the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU which led to period of political instability in the UK during the late 2010s.[5][6][7] He has also been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of elitism and political opportunism. Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron (1932\u20132010) a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur (n\u00e9e Mount; born 1934),[8] a retired Justice of the Peace and a daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet.[9] Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962.[8] The journalist Toby Young has described Cameron's background as being \"upper-upper-middle class\".[10] Cameron was born in Marylebone, London,[11] and raised at Peasemore in Berkshire.[12] He has a brother, Alexander Cameron QC (born 1963), a barrister,[13] and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).[8][14] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010;[15] Ian was born with both legs deformed, and underwent repeated operations to correct this. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,[16][17] who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.[18] Blairmore was sold soon after Ian's birth.[17] Cameron has said, \"On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh, and English.\"[19] He has also referenced the German-Jewish ancestry of one of his great-grandfathers, Arthur Levita, a descendant of the Yiddish author Elia Levita.[20][21] From the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two independent schools: at Heatherdown School in Winkfield (near Ascot) in Berkshire, which counts Prince Andrew and Prince Edward among its old boys. Owing to good grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early.[22] At the age of thirteen he went on to Eton College in Berkshire, following his father and elder brother.[23] His early interest was in art. Six weeks before taking his O-Levels he was caught smoking cannabis.[24] He admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled; instead he was fined, prevented from leaving the school grounds, and given a \"Georgic\" (a punishment that involved copying 500 lines of Latin text).[25] Cameron passed twelve O-Levels and then three A-levels: History of art; History, in which he was taught by Michael Kidson; and Economics with Politics. He obtained three 'A' grades and a '1' grade in the Scholarship Level exam in Economics and Politics.[26] The following autumn, he passed the entrance exam for the University of Oxford, and was offered an exhibition at Brasenose College.[27] After leaving Eton in 1984,[28] Cameron started a nine-month gap year. For three months he worked as a researcher for his godfather Tim Rathbone, then Conservative MP for Lewes, during which time he attended debates in the House of Commons.[29] Through his father, he was then employed for a further three months in Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson as a 'ship jumper', an administrative post.[30] Returning from Hong Kong, Cameron visited the then Soviet Union, where he was approached by two Russian men speaking fluent English. Cameron was later told by one of his professors that it was \"definitely an attempt\" by the KGB to recruit him.[31] In October 1985, Cameron began his Bachelor of Arts course in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford.[32] His tutor, Professor Vernon Bogdanor, has described him as \"one of the ablest\" students he has taught,[33] with \"moderate and sensible Conservative\" political views.[14] Guy Spier, who shared tutorials with him, remembers him as an outstanding student: \"We were doing our best to grasp basic economic concepts. David\u2014there was nobody else who came even close. He would be integrating them with the way the British political system is put together. He could have lectured me on it, and I would have sat there and taken notes.\"[34] When commenting in 2006 on his former pupil's ideas about a \"Bill of Rights\" to replace the Human Rights Act, however, Professor Bogdanor, himself a Liberal Democrat, said, \"I think he is very confused. I've read his speech and it's filled with contradictions. There are one or two good things in it but one glimpses them, as it were, through a mist of misunderstanding\".[35] While at Oxford, Cameron was a member of the Bullingdon Club, a student dining society that has a reputation for an outlandish drinking culture associated with boisterous behaviour and damaging property.[36] Cameron's period in the Bullingdon Club was examined in a Channel 4 docu-drama, When Boris Met Dave. Cameron graduated in 1988 with a first-class honours BA degree (later promoted to an MA by seniority).[37] After graduation, Cameron worked for the Conservative Research Department between September 1988 and 1993. His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation; he befriended fellow young colleagues, including Edward Llewellyn, Ed Vaizey and Rachel Whetstone. They and others formed a group they called the \"Smith Square set\", which was dubbed the \"Brat Pack\" by the press, though it is better known as the \"Notting Hill set\", a name given to it pejoratively by Derek Conway.[38] In 1991, Cameron was seconded to Downing Street to work on briefing John Major for the then twice-weekly sessions of Prime Minister's Questions. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for \"sharper\u00a0... Despatch box performances\" by Major,[39] which included highlighting for Major \"a dreadful piece of doublespeak\" by Tony Blair (then the Labour Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national minimum wage.[40] He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow Judith Chaplin as Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.[41] However, Cameron lost to Jonathan Hill, who was appointed in March 1992. Instead, Cameron was given the responsibility for briefing Major for his press conferences during the 1992 general election.[42] During the campaign, Cameron was one of the young \"brat pack\" of party strategists who worked between 12 and 20 hours a day, sleeping in the house of Alan Duncan in Gayfere Street, Westminster, which had been Major's campaign headquarters during his bid for the Conservative leadership.[43] Cameron headed the economic section; it was while working on this campaign that Cameron first worked closely with and befriended Steve Hilton, who was later to become Director of Strategy during his party leadership.[44] The strain of getting up at 04:45 every day was reported to have led Cameron to decide to leave politics in favour of journalism.[45] The Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues, saying \"whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right\", and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across Smith Square to jeer at Transport House, the former Labour headquarters.[46] Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont.[47] Cameron was working for Lamont at the time of Black Wednesday, when pressure from currency speculators forced the pound sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference, Cameron had difficulty trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion, Patricia Morris, to contact him.[48] Later that month, Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the Christian Democratic Union; he was reported to be \"still smarting\" over the Bundesbank's contribution to the economic crisis.[49] Lamont fell out with John Major after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 Budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to Conservative Campaign Headquarters for their political acceptability to be assessed.[50] By May 1993, the Conservatives' average poll rating dropped below 30%, where they would remain until the 1997 general election.[51] Major and Lamont's personal ratings also declined dramatically. However, Lamont's unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron, who was considered as a potential \"kamikaze\" candidate for the Newbury by-election, which includes the area where he grew up.[52] However, he decided not to stand. During the by-election, Lamont gave the response \"Je ne regrette rien\" to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see \"the green shoots of recovery\" or admitting to \"singing in his bath\" with happiness at leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this gaffe; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming Chancellor himself, even though as he was not a Member of Parliament he could not have been.[53] Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.[54] After Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the Treasury for less than a month before being specifically recruited by Home Secretary Michael Howard. It was commented that he was still \"very much in favour\"[55] and it was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on.[56] At the beginning of September 1993, Cameron applied to go on Conservative Central Office's list of prospective parliamentary candidates (PPCs).[57] Cameron was much more socially liberal than Howard but enjoyed working for him.[51] According to Derek Lewis, then Director-General of Her Majesty's Prison Service, Cameron showed him a \"his and her list\" of proposals made by Howard and his wife, Sandra. Lewis said that Sandra Howard's list included reducing the quality of prison food, although she denied this claim. Lewis reported that Cameron was \"uncomfortable\" about the list.[58] In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist Bruce Anderson wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase \"balanced diet\", and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.[59] During his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed the media. In March 1994, someone leaked to the press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the Prevention of Terrorism Act. After an inquiry failed to find the source of the leak, Labour MP Peter Mandelson demanded assurance from Howard that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave.[60][61] A senior Home Office civil servant noted the influence of Howard's Special Advisers, saying previous incumbents \"would listen to the evidence before making a decision. Howard just talks to young public school gentlemen from the party headquarters.\"[62] In July 1994, Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications.[63] Carlton, which had won the ITV franchise for London weekdays in 1991, was a growing media company which also had film-distribution and video-producing arms. Cameron was suggested for the role to Carlton executive chairman Michael P. Green by his later mother-in-law Lady Astor.[64] Cameron left Carlton to run for Parliament in 1997, returning to his job after his defeat. In 1997, Cameron played up the company's prospects for digital terrestrial television, for which it joined with ITV Granada and Sky to form British Digital Broadcasting. In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998 he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry.[65] Carlton's consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers. Cameron resigned as Director of Corporate Affairs in February 2001 in order to run for Parliament for a second time, although he remained on the payroll as a consultant. Having been approved for the PPCs' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the 1997 general election. He was reported to have missed out on selection for Ashford in December 1994, after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays.[66] In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for Stafford, a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority.[51][67] The incumbent Conservative MP, Bill Cash, ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of Stone, where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called for tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to \"small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going\".[68] He also said the Party \"should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements\u00a0... It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda. The socialist Prime Ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion.\"[69] When writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the single European currency clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations.[70] Otherwise, Cameron kept closely to the national party line. He also campaigned using the claim that a Labour government would increase the cost of a pint of beer by 24p; however, the Labour candidate, David Kidney, portrayed Cameron as \"a right-wing Tory\". Initially Cameron thought he had a 50/50 chance, but as the campaign wore on and the scale of the impending Conservative defeat grew, Cameron prepared himself for defeat.[71] On election day, Stafford had a swing of 10.7%, almost the same as the national swing, which made it one of the many seats to fall to Labour: Kidney defeated Cameron by 24,606 votes (47.5%) to 20,292 (39.2%), a majority of 4,314 (8.3%).[72][73] In the round of selection contests taking place in the run-up to the 2001 general election, Cameron again attempted to be selected for a winnable seat. He tried for the Kensington and Chelsea seat after the death of Alan Clark, but did not make the shortlist. He was in the final two but narrowly lost at Wealden in March 2000,[74] a loss ascribed by Samantha Cameron to his lack of spontaneity when speaking.[75] On 4 April 2000, Cameron was selected as PPC for Witney in Oxfordshire. This had been a safe Conservative seat, but its sitting MP Shaun Woodward (who had worked with Cameron on the 1992 election campaign) had \"crossed the floor\" to join the Labour Party and was selected instead for the safe Labour seat of St Helens South. Cameron's biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning describe the two men as being \"on fairly friendly terms\".[76] Cameron, advised in his strategy by friend Catherine Fall, put a great deal of effort into \"nursing\" his potential constituency, turning up at social functions, and attacking Woodward for changing his mind on fox hunting to support a ban.[77] During the election campaign, Cameron accepted the offer of writing a regular column for The Guardian's online section.[78] He won the seat with a 1.9% swing to the Conservatives, taking 22,153 votes (45%) to Labour candidate Michael Bartlet's 14,180 (28.8%), a majority of 7,973 (16.2%).[79][80] Upon his election to Parliament, he served as a member of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP. Cameron proposed that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs,[81] and urged the consideration of \"radical options\".[82] The report recommended a downgrading of Ecstasy from Class A to Class B, as well as moves towards a policy of 'harm reduction', which Cameron defended.[83] Cameron endorsed Iain Duncan Smith in the 2001 Conservative Party leadership election and organised an event in Witney for party supporters to hear John Bercow speaking for him.[84] Two days before Duncan Smith won the leadership contest on 13 September 2001, the 9/11 attacks took place in New York City. Cameron described Tony Blair's response to the attacks as \"masterful\", saying \"He moved fast, and set the agenda both at home and abroad. He correctly identified the problem of Islamist extremism, the inadequacy of our response both domestically and internationally, and supported \u2013 quite rightly in my view \u2013 the action to remove the Taliban regime from Afghanistan.\"[85] Cameron determinedly attempted to increase his public visibility, offering quotations on matters of public controversy. He opposed the payment of compensation to Gurbux Singh, who had resigned as head of the Commission for Racial Equality after a confrontation with the police;[86] and commented that the Home Affairs Select Committee had taken a long time to discuss whether the phrase \"black market\" should be used.[87] However, he was passed over for a front-bench promotion in July 2002; Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith did invite Cameron and his ally George Osborne to coach him on Prime Minister's Questions in November 2002. The next week, Cameron deliberately abstained in a vote on allowing same-sex and unmarried couples to adopt children jointly, against a whip to oppose; his abstention was noted.[88] The wide scale of abstentions and rebellious votes destabilised the Duncan Smith leadership. In June 2003, Cameron was appointed a shadow minister in the Privy Council Office as a deputy to Eric Forth, then Shadow Leader of the House. He also became a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party when Michael Howard took over the leadership in November of that year. He was appointed Opposition frontbench local government spokesman in 2004, before being promoted to the Shadow Cabinet that June as head of policy co-ordination. Later, he became Shadow Education Secretary in the post-election reshuffle.[89] Daniel Finkelstein has said of the period leading up to Cameron's election as leader of the Conservative party that \"a small group of us (myself, David Cameron, George Osborne, Michael Gove, Nick Boles, Nick Herbert I think, once or twice) used to meet up in the offices of Policy Exchange, eat pizza, and consider the future of the Conservative Party\".[90] Cameron's relationship with Osborne is regarded as particularly close; Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi suggested the closeness of Osborne's relationship with Cameron meant the two effectively shared power during Cameron's time as Prime Minister.[91] From February 2002 to August 2005 he was a non-executive director of Urbium PLC, operator of the Tiger Tiger bar chain.[92] Following the Labour victory in the May 2005 general election, Michael Howard announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and set a lengthy timetable for the leadership election. Cameron announced on 29 September 2005 that he would be a candidate. Parliamentary colleagues supporting him included Boris Johnson, Shadow Chancellor George Osborne, Shadow Defence Secretary and deputy leader of the party Michael Ancram, Oliver Letwin[93] and former party leader William Hague.[94] His campaign did not gain wide support until his speech, delivered without notes, at the 2005 Conservative party conference. In the speech he vowed to make people \"feel good about being Conservatives again\" and said he wanted \"to switch on a whole new generation.\"[95] His speech was well-received; The Daily Telegraph said speaking without notes \"showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit\".[96] In the first ballot of Conservative MPs on 18 October 2005, Cameron came second, with 56 votes, slightly more than expected; David Davis had fewer than predicted at 62 votes; Liam Fox came third with 42 votes; and Kenneth Clarke was eliminated with 38 votes. In the second ballot on 20 October 2005, Cameron came first with 90 votes; David Davis was second, with 57; and Liam Fox was eliminated with 51 votes.[97] All 198 Conservative MPs voted in both ballots. The next stage of the election process, between Davis and Cameron, was a vote open to the entire party membership. Cameron was elected with more than twice as many votes as Davis and more than half of all ballots issued; Cameron won 134,446 votes on a 78% turnout, to Davis's 64,398.[98] Although Davis had initially been the favourite, it was widely acknowledged that his candidacy was marred by a disappointing conference speech.[99] Cameron's election as the Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition was announced on 6 December 2005. As is customary for an Opposition leader not already a member, upon election Cameron became a member of the Privy Council, being formally approved to join on 14 December 2005, and sworn of the Council on 8 March 2006.[100] Cameron's relative youth and inexperience before becoming leader invited satirical comparison with Tony Blair. Private Eye soon published a picture of both leaders on its front cover, with the caption \"World's first face transplant a success\".[101] On the left, the New Statesman unfavourably likened his \"new style of politics\" to Tony Blair's early leadership years.[102] Cameron was accused of paying excessive attention to appearance: ITV News broadcast footage from the 2006 Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth shows him wearing four different sets of clothes within a few hours.[103] In his Guardian column, comedy writer and broadcaster Charlie Brooker described the Conservative leader as \"a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside\" in April 2007.[104] On the right of the party, Norman Tebbit, the former Conservative chairman, likened Cameron to Pol Pot, \"intent on purging even the memory of Thatcherism before building a New Modern Compassionate Green Globally Aware Party\".[105] Quentin Davies MP, who defected from the Conservatives to Labour on 26 June 2007, branded him \"superficial, unreliable and [with] an apparent lack of any clear convictions\" and stated that David Cameron had turned the Conservative Party's mission into a \"PR agenda\".[106] Traditionalist conservative columnist and author Peter Hitchens wrote, \"Mr Cameron has abandoned the last significant difference between his party and the established left\", by embracing social liberalism.[107] Daily Telegraph correspondent and blogger Gerald Warner was particularly scathing about Cameron's leadership, saying that it alienated traditionalist conservative elements from the Conservative Party.[108] Before he became Conservative leader, Cameron was reportedly known to friends and family as \"Dave\", though his preference is \"David\" in public.[109][110] Labour used the slogan Dave the Chameleon in their 2006 local elections party broadcast to portray Cameron as an ever-changing populist, which was criticised as negative campaigning by the Conservative press including The Daily Telegraph,[111] though Cameron asserted the broadcast had become his daughter's \"favourite video\".[112] During the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used cannabis and cocaine recreationally before becoming an MP.[113] Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme Question Time, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to \"err and stray\" in their past.[114] During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking that \"I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn't have done. We all did.\"[114] His Shadow Cabinet appointments included MPs associated with the various wings of the party. Former leader William Hague was appointed to the Foreign Affairs brief, while both George Osborne and David Davis were retained, as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and Shadow Home Secretary respectively. Hague, assisted by Davis, stood in for Cameron during his paternity leave in February 2006.[115] In June 2008, Davis announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary by Dominic Grieve; Davis' surprise move was seen as a challenge to the changes introduced under Cameron's leadership.[116] A reshuffle of the Shadow Cabinet was undertaken in January 2009. The chief change was the appointment of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke as Shadow Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Secretary, David Cameron stating that \"With Ken Clarke's arrival, we now have the best economic team.\" The reshuffle also saw eight other changes made.[117] During his successful 2005 campaign to be elected Leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron pledged that the Conservative Party's Members of the European Parliament would leave the European People's Party group, which had a \"federalist\" approach to the European Union.[118] Once elected Cameron began discussions with right-wing and Eurosceptic parties in other European countries, mainly in eastern Europe, and in July 2006 he concluded an agreement to form the Movement for European Reform with the Czech Civic Democratic Party, leading to the formation of a new European Parliament group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, in 2009 after the European Parliament elections.[119] Cameron attended a gathering at Warsaw's Palladium cinema celebrating the foundation of the alliance.[120] In forming the caucus, which had 54 MEPs drawn from eight of the 27 EU member states, Cameron reportedly broke with two decades of Conservative co-operation with the centre-right Christian Democrats, the European People's Party (EPP),[121] on the grounds that they are dominated by European federalists and supporters of the Lisbon treaty.[121] EPP leader Wilfried Martens, former Prime Minister of Belgium, has stated \"Cameron's campaign has been to take his party back to the centre in every policy area with one major exception: Europe.\u00a0... I can't understand his tactics. Merkel and Sarkozy will never accept his Euroscepticism.\"[121] Similarly, Cameron's initial \"A-List\" of prospective parliamentary candidates was attacked by members of his party,[122] and the policy was discontinued in favour of sex-balanced final shortlists. Before being discontinued, the policy had been criticised by senior Conservative MP and former Prisons Spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe as an \"insult to women\", and she had accused Cameron of \"storing up huge problems for the future.\"[123] In April 2009, The Independent reported that in 1989, while Nelson Mandela remained imprisoned under the apartheid regime, David Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm. A spokesperson for Cameron responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to sanctions against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip \"jolly\", saying that \"it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The Botha regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence.\" Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime. He was criticised by Labour MP Peter Hain, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner.[124] At the launch of the Conservative Party's education manifesto in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the \"brazenly elite\" approach to education of countries such as Singapore and South Korea and expressed a desire to \"elevate the status of teaching in our country\".[125] He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from \"good\" universities.[126] Wes Streeting, then president of the National Union of Students, said \"The message that the Conservatives are sending to the majority of students is that if you didn't go to a university attended by members of the Shadow Cabinet, they don't believe you're worth as much.\"[127] During the MPs expenses scandal in 2009, Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying \"excessive\" expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:We have to acknowledge just how bad this is, the public are really angry and we have to start by saying, \"Look, this system that we have, that we used, that we operated, that we took part in\u2014it was wrong and we are sorry about that\".[128]One day later, The Daily Telegraph published figures showing over five years he had claimed \u00a382,450 on his second home allowance.[129] Cameron repaid \u00a3680 claimed for repairs to his constituency home.[130] Although he was not accused of breaking any rules, Cameron was placed on the defensive over mortgage interest expense claims covering his constituency home, after a report in The Mail on Sunday suggested he could have reduced the mortgage interest bill by putting an additional \u00a375,000 of his own money towards purchasing the home in Witney instead of paying off an earlier mortgage on his London home.[131] Cameron said that doing things differently would not have saved the taxpayer any money, as he was paying more on mortgage interest than he was able to reclaim as expenses anyway[131] He also spoke out in favour of laws giving voters the power to \"recall\" or \"sack\" MPs accused of wrongdoing.[131] In April 2014, he was criticised for his handling of the expenses row surrounding Culture Secretary Maria Miller, when he rejected calls from fellow Conservative MPs to sack her from the front bench.[132] The Conservatives had last won a general election in 1992. The 2010 general election resulted in the Conservatives, led by Cameron, winning the largest number of seats (306). This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority and resulted in the nation's first hung parliament since February 1974.[133] Talks between Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition. Cameron in late 2009 had urged the Liberal Democrats to join the Conservatives in a new \"national movement\" saying there was \"barely a cigarette paper\" between them on a large number of issues. The invitation was rejected at the time by the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, who said that the Conservatives were totally different from his party and that the Lib Dems were the true \"progressives\" in UK politics.[134] On 11 May 2010, following the resignation of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister and on his recommendation, Queen Elizabeth II invited Cameron to form a government.[135] At age 43, Cameron became the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, beating the record previously set by Tony Blair in May 1997.[1] In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron outlined how he intended to \"put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest.\"[1] As one of his first moves Cameron appointed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as Deputy Prime Minister on 11 May 2010.[135] Between them, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats controlled 363 seats in the House of Commons, with a majority of 76 seats.[136] In June 2010 Cameron described the economic situation as he came to power as \"even worse than we thought\" and warned of \"difficult decisions\" to be made over spending cuts.[137] By the beginning of 2015 he was able to claim that his government's austerity programme had succeeded in halving the budget deficit, although as a percentage of GDP rather than in cash terms.[138][139] In December 2010, Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.[140][141] Cameron agreed to holding the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and eliminated the \"devomax\" option from the ballot for a straight out yes or no vote. His support for the successful Better Together campaign extended to making a successful request to the Queen to intervene.[142] He had also backed a successful campaign to retain the status quo in a referendum on changing the voting system held at the request of his coalition partners. He supported the introduction of gay marriage despite more of his own Conservative MPs voting against the move than for it, meaning the support of Lib Dem MPs in government and Labour MPs in opposition was required to allow it to pass.[143] Earlier in his term he had managed to secure a huge majority for UK participation in UN-backed military action in Libya,[144] but Cameron became the first prime minister since 1782 to lose a foreign policy vote in the House of Commons over proposed military action against Assad's regime in Syria.[145][146] Subsequently, Barack Obama asked congressional approval,[147] which was not ultimately granted. In response to the Great Recession, Cameron undertook the austerity programme. This was a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the welfare state in the United Kingdom. The National Health Service[149] and education[150] have been \"ringfenced\" and protected from direct spending cuts.[151] Together with Chancellor George Osborne, Cameron aimed to eliminate the structural deficit (i.e. deficit on current spending as opposed to investment) and to have government debt falling as a percentage of GDP.[152] By 2015, the deficit as a percentage of GDP had been reduced to half what it was in 2010, and the sale of government assets (mostly the shares of banks nationalised in the 2000s) had resulted in government debt as a proportion of GDP falling.[152] Cameron said immigration from outside the EU should be subject to annual limits. He said in July 2013 that \"in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax. The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.\"[153] In 2015, The Independent reported, \"The Conservatives have failed spectacularly to deliver their pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014\u2014up from 210,000 in the previous year.\"[154] In 2014, Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a \"first class-player in terms of defence\" and no longer a \"full partner\" to the United States.[155] In the July 2015 budget Chancellor George Osborne announced that the UK defence spending would meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP.[156] Cameron condemned the violence used against anti-Gaddafi protesters at the beginning of the Libyan Civil War[157] After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011 the United Nations Security Council approved a no-fly zone to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi rebels.[158] Two days later the UK and the United States fired more than 110 Tomahawk missiles at targets in Libya.[159] Cameron said he was \"proud\" of the role United Kingdom played in the overthrow of Gaddafi's government.[160] Cameron also stated that UK had played a \"very important role\",[161] adding that \"a lot of people said that Tripoli was completely different to Benghazi and that the two don't get on\u2014they were wrong.\u00a0... People who said 'this is all going to be an enormous swamp of Islamists and extremists'\u2014they were wrong\".[162] In 2015 through 2016 the Foreign Affairs Select Committee conducted an extensive and highly critical inquiry into the British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By mid-2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of regime change. However that new policy did not include proper support and for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya and the growth of ISIL in North Africa. It concluded that Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure.[163][164][165] US President Barack Obama also acknowledged there had been issues with following up the conflict planning, commenting in an interview with The Atlantic magazine that Cameron had allowed himself to be \"distracted by a range of other things\".[166][167][168] In 2013, in response to Argentina's calls for negotiations over the Falkland Islands' sovereignty, a referendum was called asking Falkland Islanders whether they supported the continuation of their status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom. With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory with only three votes against.[169] In light of this, Cameron said: \"We believe in the Falkland islanders' right to self-determination. They had a referendum. They couldn't have been more clear about wanting to remain with our country and we should protect and defend them\".[170] Cameron supported Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia.[171] In January 2015, Cameron travelled to the Saudi capital Riyadh to pay his respects following the death of the nation's King Abdullah. According to WikiLeaks, Cameron initiated a secret deal with Saudi Arabia ensuring both countries were elected onto the U.N. Human Rights Council.[172] In 2015, Cameron's government announced \"firm political support\" for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shi'a Houthis,[173] re-supplying the Saudi military with weapons and providing them with training.[174][175][176] Cameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War.[177] \"There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the Tamil minority in that country\" Cameron stated.[178][179] He stated that, if this investigation was not completed by March 2014, he would press for an independent international inquiry.[180][181][182] This followed a visit to Jaffna, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of Sri Lanka; Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948.[183][184] Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing missing relatives.[185][186] In a speech in Ankara in July 2010, Cameron stated unequivocally his support for Turkey's accession to the EU, citing economic, security and political considerations, and claimed that those who opposed Turkish membership were driven by \"protectionism, narrow nationalism or prejudice\".[187][188] In that speech, he was also critical of Israeli action during the Gaza flotilla raid and its Gaza policy, and repeated his opinion that Israel had turned Gaza into a \"prison camp\",[187] having previously referred to Gaza as \"a giant open prison\".[189] These views were met with mixed reactions.[190][191][192] The Cameron government declined to formally recognise the Ottoman Empire's massacres of Armenians as a \"genocide\".[193] During the EU referendum campaign, Cameron stated that Turkey was unlikely to be ready to join the EU 'until the year 3000' at its current rate of progress.[194] At the end of May 2011, Cameron stepped down as patron of the Jewish National Fund,[195][196] becoming the first British prime minister not to be patron of the charity in the 110 years of its existence.[197] In a speech in 2011 Cameron said: \"You have a Prime Minister whose commitment and determination to work for peace in Israel is deep and strong. Britain will continue to push for peace, but will always stand up for Israel against those who wish her harm\". He said he wanted to reaffirm his \"unshakable\" belief in Israel within the same message.[198] He also voiced his opposition to the Goldstone Report, claiming it had been biased against Israel and not enough blame had been placed on Hamas. In March 2014, during his first visit to Israel as Prime Minister, Cameron addressed Israel's Knesset in Jerusalem, where he offered his full support for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians, hoping a two-state solution might be achieved.[199] He also made clear his rejection of trade or academic boycotts against Israel,[200] acknowledged Israel's right to defend its citizens as \"a right enshrined in international law,\" and made note of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, as \"the moment when the State of Israel went from a dream to a plan, Britain has played a proud and vital role in helping to secure Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people.\"[199] During his two-day visit, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.[201] Senior Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi resigned over the Cameron government's decision not to condemn Israel for the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, saying that the government's \"approach and language during the current crisis in Gaza is morally indefensible.\"[202] In August 2013, Cameron lost a motion in favour of bombing Syrian armed forces in response to the Ghouta chemical attack, becoming the first prime minister to suffer such a foreign-policy defeat since 1782.[203] In September 2014, MPs passed a motion in favour of British planes joining, at the request of the Iraqi government, a bombing campaign against Islamic State (IS) targets in Iraq;[204] the motion explicitly expressed parliament's disapproval of UK military action in Syria.[205] Cameron promised that, before expanding UK air strikes to include IS units in Syria, he would seek parliamentary approval.[206] In July 2015, a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by Reprieve revealed that, without the knowledge of UK parliamentarians, RAF pilots had, in fact, been bombing targets in Syria, and that Cameron knew of this.[207][208] The prime minister, along with Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, faced strong criticism, including from Conservative MPs, for not informing the Commons about this deployment; the Ministry of Defence said that the pilots concerned were \"embedded\" with foreign military forces, and so were \"effectively\" operating as such, while Fallon denied that MPs had been, as he put it, \"kept in the dark\".[209][210][211] The Reprieve FoI request also revealed that British drone pilots had been embedded, almost continuously, with American forces at Creech Air Force Base since 2008. These drone operators, who were \"a gift of services\", meaning the UK still paid their salaries and covered their expenses, had been carrying out operations that included reconnaissance in Syria to assist American strikes against IS.[212] Fallon said that it was \"illogical\" for the UK not to bomb ISIL in Syria, for the organisation does not \"differentiate between Syria and Iraq\" and is \"organised and directed and administered from Syria\".[213] Following the terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility, Cameron began pushing for a strategy for the Royal Air Force to bomb Syria in retaliation.[214] Cameron set out his case for military intervention to Parliament on 26 November, telling MPs that it was the only way to guarantee Britain's safety and would be part of a \"comprehensive\" strategy to defeat IS.[215] On 3 December 2015 MPs voted 397\u2013223 in favour of launching air strikes against ISIL targets in Syria. The vote for military action was supported by all but seven members of the Parliamentary Conservative Party, as well as 66 Labour MPs who backed the government in defiance of their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who had expressed his opposition to air strikes.[216] On 7 May 2015, Cameron was re-elected UK Prime Minister with a majority in the Commons. The Conservative Party's decisive win in the general election was as a surprise victory, as most polls and commentators predicted the outcome would be too close to call and result in a second hung parliament.[217] Cameron said of his first term when returned as Prime Minister for a second term that he was \"proud to lead the first coalition government in 70 years\" and offered particular thanks to Clegg for his role in it.[218] Forming the first Conservative majority government since 1992, David Cameron became the first Prime Minister to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a larger popular vote share since Lord Salisbury at the 1900 general election. In response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, Cameron secured the support of the House of Commons to extend air strikes against ISIS into Syria.[219] Earlier that year, Cameron had outlined a five-year strategy to counter Islamist extremism and subversive teachings.[220] As promised in the election manifesto, Cameron set a date for a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union, and announced that he would be campaigning for Britain to remain within a \"reformed EU\".[221] The terms of the UK's membership of the EU were re-negotiated, with agreement reached in February 2016.[222] The referendum came to be known as Brexit (a portmanteau of \"British\" and \"exit\") and was held on 23 June 2016. The result was approximately 52% in favour of leaving the European Union and 48% against, with a turnout of 72%.[223][224] On 24 June, a few hours after the results became known, Cameron announced that he would resign the office of Prime Minister by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016. In a speech the next day outside 10 Downing Street, he stated that, on account of his own advocacy on behalf of remaining in the EU, \"I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\"[3][225][226] There was some strong criticism made of Cameron and his government following the referendum. Matthew Norman, in an opinion piece in The Independent, called the referendum an act of \"indescribably selfish recklessness.\"[227] In late July, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee was told that Cameron had refused to allow the Civil Service to make plans for Brexit, a decision the committee described as \"an act of gross negligence.\"[228] His farewell speech as he left No 10 accompanied by his family stressed the value of selfless public service.[229] The Conservative Party leadership election was scheduled for 9 September and the new leader was expected to be in place by the autumn conference, set to begin on 2 October.[230] On 11 July, following the withdrawal of Andrea Leadsom from the Conservative Party leadership election and the confirmation of Theresa May as the new leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron announced he would hold a final cabinet meeting on 12 July and then following a final Prime Minister's Questions submit his resignation to the Queen on the afternoon of 13 July. After his final Prime Minister's Questions, Cameron received a standing ovation from MPs; his final comment was, \"I was the future once\" \u2013 a reference to his 2005 quip to Tony Blair, \"he was the future once\". Cameron then submitted his resignation to the Queen later that day.[231] Although no longer serving as Prime Minister, Cameron originally stated that he would continue inside Parliament, on the Conservative backbenches.[232] On 12 September, however, he announced that he was resigning his seat with immediate effect,[233] and was appointed to the Manor of Northstead. He was succeeded as MP for Witney by fellow Conservative Robert Courts.[234] The Washington Post described him as having \"sped away without glancing back\" once Theresa May had \"vaulted herself out of the hurricane-strength political wreckage of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.\"[235] Cameron described himself in December 2005 as a \"modern compassionate conservative\" and spoke of a need for a new style of politics, saying that he was \"fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster\".[236] He was \"certainly a big Thatcher fan, but I don't know whether that makes me a Thatcherite\",[237] claiming to be a \"liberal Conservative\", though \"not a deeply ideological person.\"[238] As Leader of the Opposition, Cameron asserted that he did not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and would offer his support in areas of agreement. He has urged politicians to concentrate more on improving people's happiness and \"general well-being\", instead of focusing solely on \"financial wealth\".[239] There were claims that he described himself to journalists at a dinner during the leadership contest as the \"heir to Blair\".[240] In his first Conservative conference speech as party leader in Bournemouth in 2006, he described the National Health Service as \"one of the 20th Century's greatest achievements\". He went on to say, \"Tony Blair explained his priorities in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters: N.H.S.\" He also talked about his severely disabled son, Ivan, concluding \"So, for me, it is not just a question of saying the NHS is safe in my hands\u2014of course it will be. My family is so often in the hands of the NHS, so I want them to be safe there.\"[241] Cameron said that he believed in \"spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention\" in cases such as the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. However, he rejected neo-conservatism because, as a conservative, he recognises \"the complexities of human nature, and will always be sceptical of grand schemes to remake the world.\"[242] A supporter of multilateralism as \"a country may act alone\u2014but it cannot always succeed alone\", he believes multilateralism can take the form of acting through \"NATO, the UN, the G8, the EU and other institutions\", or through international alliances.[243] Cameron said that \"If the West is to help other countries, we must do so from a position of genuine moral authority\" and \"we must strive above all for legitimacy in what we do.\"[243] He believes that British Muslims have a duty to integrate into British culture, but noted in an article published in 2007 that the Muslim community finds aspects such as high divorce rates and drug use uninspiring, and that \"Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around.\"[244] In his first speech as PM on radicalisation and the causes of terrorism in February 2011, Cameron said that 'state multiculturalism' had failed.[245] In 2010 he appointed the first Muslim member of the British cabinet, Baroness Warsi, as a minister without portfolio, and in 2012 made her a special minister of state in foreign affairs. She resigned, however, in August 2014 over the government's handling of the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict. Whilst urging members of his party to support the coalition's proposals for same-sex marriage, Cameron said that he backed gay marriage not in spite of his conservatism but because he is a conservative, and claimed it was about equality.[246] In 2012, Cameron publicly apologised for Thatcher-era policies on homosexuality, specifically the introduction of the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which he described as \"a mistake\".[247] In 2006 Cameron described poverty as a \"moral disgrace\"[248] and promised to tackle relative poverty.[249] In 2007 Cameron promised, \"We can make British poverty history, and we will make British poverty history\". Also in 2007 he stated \"Ending child poverty is central to improving child well-being\".[250] In 2015 Polly Toynbee questioned Cameron's commitment to tackling poverty, contrasting his earlier statements agreeing that \"poverty is relative\" with proposals to change the government's poverty measure, and saying that cuts in child tax credits would increase child poverty among low-paid working families.[251] Cameron denied that austerity had contributed to the 2011 England riots, instead blaming street gangs and opportunistic looters.[252] In 2010 Cameron was given a score of 36% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall.[253] Prior to 2005, Cameron was opposed to gay rights, calling it a \"fringe agenda\" and attacking the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair for \"moving heaven and earth to allow the promotion of homosexuality in our schools\" by repealing the anti-gay Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988.[254] Cameron is also recorded by Hansard as having voted against same-sex adoption rights in 2002, but he denies this, claiming he abstained from the three-line whip imposed on him by his party. In 2008, he wanted lesbians who receive IVF treatment to be required to name a father figure, which received condemnation from LGBT equality groups.[254] However, Cameron supported commitment for gay couples in a 2005 speech, and in October 2011 urged Conservative MPs to support gay marriage.[246] In November 2012, Cameron and Nick Clegg agreed to fast-track legislation for introducing same-sex marriage.[255] Cameron stated that he wanted to give religious groups the ability to host gay marriage ceremonies, and that he did not want to exclude gay people from a \"great institution\".[256] In 2013, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 became law despite opposition from more than half of his fellow Conservative MPs, including Cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and David Jones.[257] He also subsequently appointed two women who had voted against same-sex marriage as ministers in the Government Equalities Office, Nicky Morgan and Caroline Dinenage following the 2015 general election.[258] In August 2013, he rejected calls by Stephen Fry and others to strip Russia from hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics due to its anti-gay laws.[259] Cameron did not attend the games but denied it was a boycott in protest at Russia's laws, having previously raised the issue of gay rights in the country with Vladimir Putin.[260] Cameron criticised Gordon Brown (when Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer) for being \"an analogue politician in a digital age\" and referred to him as \"the roadblock to reform\".[261] As Prime Minister, he reacted to press reports that Brown could be the next head of the International Monetary Fund by hinting that he may block the appointment, citing the huge national debt that Brown left the country with as a reason for Brown not being suitable for the role.[262] He said that John Prescott \"clearly looks a fool\" after Prescott's personal indiscretions were revealed in spring 2006, and wondered if the Deputy Prime Minister had broken the ministerial code.[263] During a speech to the Ethnic Media Conference in November 2006, Cameron also described Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, as an \"ageing far left politician\" following Livingstone's criticism of Trevor Phillips, head of the Commission for Racial Equality.[264] In 2006, Cameron made a speech in which he described extremist Islamic organisations and the British National Party as \"mirror images\" to each other, both preaching \"creeds of pure hatred\".[265] Cameron is listed as being a supporter of Unite Against Fascism.[266] In April 2006, Cameron accused the UK Independence Party of being \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly\",[267] leading UKIP MEP Nigel Farage (who became leader in September of that year) to demand an apology for the remarks. Right-wing Conservative MP Bob Spink, who later defected to UKIP, also criticised the remarks,[268] as did The Daily Telegraph.[269] Cameron was seen encouraging Conservative MPs to join the standing ovation given to Tony Blair at the end of his last Prime Minister's Question Time; he had paid tribute to the \"huge efforts\" Blair had made and said Blair had \"considerable achievements to his credit, whether it is peace in Northern Ireland or his work in the developing world, which will endure\".[270] In September 2015, after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, Cameron called the party a \"threat\" to British national and economic security, on the basis of Corbyn's defence and fiscal policies.[271] In an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to war in Iraq, and said that he thought supporters should \"see it through\".[272] He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006 calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war. In 2011, he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq. He repeatedly called for the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying \"People want to know the truth\".[273] Cameron was a strong advocate of increased ties between India and the United Kingdom, describing Indian\u2013British relations as the \"New Special Relationship\" in 2010.[274][275] In October 2012, as Narendra Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK rescinded its boycott of the then-Gujarat state Chief Minister over religious riots in Gujarat in 2002 that left more than 2,000 dead,[276] and in November 2013, Cameron commented that he was \"open\" to meeting Modi.[277] Modi was later elected as Prime Minister in a landslide majority, leading to Cameron calling Modi and congratulating him on the \"election success\",[278] one of the first Western leaders to do so.[279] While Leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron was accused of reliance on \"old-boy networks\",[280] and conversely attacked by his party for the imposition of selective shortlists of women and ethnic minority prospective parliamentary candidates.[122] Some of Cameron's senior appointments, such as George Osborne as Chancellor of the Exchequer, are former members of the Bullingdon Club. Michael Gove conceded it was \"ridiculous\" how many fellow Cabinet ministers were old Etonians, though he placed the blame on the failings of the state education system rather than Cameron.[281] However, Michael Mosbacher, co-founder of Standpoint magazine, wrote that Cameron's Cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: \"David Cameron's government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated\u2014indeed the least Etonian Conservative-led government this country has ever seen\".[282] Following poor results in the May 2012 local elections after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls, there were concerns from Conservative MPs about Cameron's leadership and his electability. David Davies, the chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, accused the Conservative leadership of \"incompetence\" and hinted that it could risk Cameron's leadership.[283] Nadine Dorries warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen.[284] Later that year, Conservative MP Brian Binley openly said that Cameron's leadership was like being a \"maid\" to the Liberal Democrats, and accused him of leading the party to defeat. In January 2013 it was revealed that Adam Afriyie was planning his own bid for the Conservative leadership with the support of fellow MPs Mark Field, Bill Wiggin, Chris Heaton-Harris, Patrick Mercer, Jonathan Djanogly and Dan Byles. The Times and ConservativeHome revealed that a 'rebel reserve' of 55 Conservative MPs gave firm pledges to a co-ordinating MP to support a motion of 'no confidence' and write to Brady simultaneously, more than the 46 MPs needed to trigger a vote of no confidence.[285] Andrew Bridgen openly called for a vote of confidence in Cameron's leadership and claimed that the Prime Minister had a \"credibility problem\" but he dropped his bid for a contest a year later.[286] In 2007 Cameron appointed Andy Coulson, former editor of the News of the World, as his director of communications. Coulson had resigned as the paper's editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to illegal phone hacking, although stating that he knew nothing about it.[287][288] In June 2010 Downing Street confirmed Coulson's annual salary as \u00a3140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government.[289] In January 2011 Coulson left his post, saying coverage of the phone-hacking scandal was making it difficult to give his best to the job.[287] In July 2011 he was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the News of the World, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance.[290] The same month, in a special parliamentary session at the House of Commons, arranged to discuss the News International phone hacking scandal, Cameron said that he \"regretted the furore\" that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that \"with hindsight\" he would not have hired him.[291] Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by Strathclyde Police in May 2012.[292][293] Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a \"full and frank\" apology for hiring him, saying \"I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that.\" The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.[294] Although Lord Ashcroft played a significant role in the 2010 election, he was not offered a ministerial post.[295] In June 2012, shortly before a major Conservative rebellion on House of Lords reform,[296] journalist Peter Oborne credited Ashcroft with \"stopping the Coalition working\" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education, taxation to the right.[295] According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome websites and a \"brutal critic of the Coalition from the start\", had established \"megaphone presence\" in the on-line media. He believes Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by \"coordinated attacks on the Coalition\" and \"the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together.\"[295] In The Observer, Andrew Rawnsley commented that he believes that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to \"generate publicity\", \"stir trouble for the prime minister\" and influence the direction of the party.[297] In 2015 Ashcroft released Call Me Dave, an unauthorised biography of Cameron written with journalist Isabel Oakeshott, which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron's time at university. The book includes an anonymous anecdote about Cameron, now referred to as Piggate, in which he allegedly inserted his penis into a dead pig's head. No evidence for the anecdote has been produced. Many commentators have described the accusations as a \"revenge job\" by Ashcroft, who was not offered a senior role in government when Cameron came to power in 2010.[298][299] Ashcroft initially claimed the book was \"not about settling scores\", while Oakeshott said that they had held back publication until after the 2015 general election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives' electoral chances.[300] Ashcroft subsequently admitted that the initiation allegations \"may have been case of mistaken identity\" and has stated that he has a personal \"beef\" with Cameron.[298][299][301][302][303] Cameron later went on to deny these allegations and stated that Ashcroft's reasons for writing the book were clear and the public could see clearly through it.[304] An ICM poll in September 2007 saw Cameron rated the least popular of the three main party leaders.[305][306] A YouGov poll on party leaders conducted on 9\u201310 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, whilst 38% thought he would be the best PM and 35% did not know.[307] In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters thought he was doing well as prime minister compared with 46% who thought he was doing badly.[308] In September 2015, an Opinium poll had similar results to the one shortly before the election, with voters split with 42% who approved of him and 41% who did not.[309] Cameron had significantly better net approval ratings in polls conducting in December and January (getting \u22126 in both) than Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (who got \u221238 and \u221239).[310] However, following the Panama Papers leak in April 2016, his personal approval ratings fell below Corbyn's.[311] In the months immediately following his resignation from the post of Prime Minister, a number of commentators gave negative evaluations of Cameron's premiership. The University of Leeds' 2016 survey of post-War Prime Ministers, which collected the views of 82 academics specialising in the history and politics of post-war Britain, ranked Cameron as the third-worst Prime Minister since 1945, ranking above only Alec Douglas-Home and Anthony Eden. 90 per cent of respondents cited his calling and losing of the Brexit referendum as his greatest failure.[312] In October 2016, Cameron became chairman of the National Citizen Service Patrons.[313] In January 2017, he was appointed president of Alzheimer's Research UK to address misconceptions surrounding dementia and campaign for medical research funding to tackle the condition.[314] All appointments post-premiership have to be approved by the UK government advisory committee. In addition to the two posts above they also approved the following positions:[315] Cameron maintained a low profile following his resignation as Prime Minister and the subsequent Brexit negotiations. In January 2019, following Theresa May's defeat in the House of Commons over her draft withdrawal agreement, Cameron gave a rare interview to reporters outside his house in Notting Hill, saying he backed May's Brexit deal with the EU and did not regret calling the 2016 referendum.[317] However, he later said that the outcome of the referendum had left him \"hugely depressed\" and told The Times he knew \"some people will never forgive me\". He confessed \"Every single day I think about it, and the fact that we lost, and the consequences, and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately\".[318] Months following Boris Johnson's election as Prime Minister, Cameron began criticising Johnson's Brexit strategy, including his decision to prorogue parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31 October and the removal of the whip from Conservative MPs who voted to block a no-deal Brexit. Additionally, he accused Johnson, as well as Michael Gove, of behaving \"appallingly\" during the referendum campaign of 2016.[318] In January 2019, several news outlets reported that Cameron's political memoir, including an account of his time in office, was more than three-quarters written.[319] This came after Cameron was reported to have signed an \u00a3800,000 contract with William Collins, an imprint of HarperCollins, in 2016.[320] It was widely sourced that Cameron was planning to hold back the release of the book by several years so that he would not be seen as a \"backstreet driver\" in May's handling of Brexit. In May 2019, HarperCollins released the book's title and release date: For the Record, published in hardback, ebook and radio on 19 September.[321][322] Cameron was portrayed by Mark Dexter in the Channel 4 television films Coalition and Brexit: The Uncivil War. Cameron is married to Samantha Gwendoline Cameron (n\u00e9e Sheffield), the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet, and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (now Viscountess Astor). A Marlborough College school friend of Cameron's sister Clare, Samantha accepted Clare's invitation to accompany the Cameron family on holiday in Tuscany, Italy, after graduating from Bristol School of Creative Arts. It was then David and Samantha's romance started. They were married on 1 June 1996 at the Church of St Augustine of Canterbury, East Hendred, Oxfordshire, five years before Cameron was elected to parliament.[8] The Camerons have had four children. Their first, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: \"The news hits you like a freight train\u00a0... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you get over that, because he's wonderful.\"[323] Ivan was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after he left it. Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six.[324] The Camerons have two daughters, Nancy Gwen (born 2004) and Florence Rose Endellion (born 2010),[325] and a son, Arthur Elwen (born 2006).[326] Cameron took paternity leave when Arthur was born, and this decision received broad coverage.[327] It was also stated that Cameron would be taking paternity leave after his second daughter was born.[325] She was born on 24 August 2010, three weeks prematurely, while the family was on holiday in Cornwall. Her third given name, Endellion, is taken from the village of St Endellion near where the Camerons were holidaying.[328][329] In early May 2008, the Camerons decided to enrol their daughter Nancy at a state primary school. For three years before that they had been attending its associated church, St Mary Abbots,[330] near the Cameron family home in North Kensington.[331] Cameron's constituency home is in Dean, Oxfordshire, and the Camerons have been described as key members of the Chipping Norton set.[332] On 8 September 2010, it was announced that Cameron would miss Prime Minister's Questions in order to fly to southern France to see his father, Ian Cameron, who had suffered a stroke with coronary complications. Later that day, with David and other family members at his bedside, Ian died.[333] On 17 September 2010, Cameron attended a private ceremony for the funeral of his father in Berkshire, which prevented him from hearing the address of Pope Benedict XVI in Westminster Hall, an occasion he would otherwise have attended.[334] In October 2010, David Cameron inherited \u00a3300,000 from his father's estate. Ian Cameron, who had worked as a stockbroker in the City of London, used multimillion-pound investment funds based in offshore tax havens, such as Jersey, Panama City, and Geneva, to increase the family wealth. In 1982, Ian Cameron created the Panamanian Blairmore Holdings, an offshore investment fund, valued at about $20 million in 1988, \"not liable to taxation on its income or capital gains\", which used bearer shares until 2006.[335] In April 2016, following the Panama Papers financial documents leak, David Cameron faced calls to resign after it was revealed that he and his wife Samantha invested in Ian Cameron's offshore fund.[336] He owned \u00a331,500 of shares in the fund and sold them for a profit of \u00a319,000 shortly before becoming Prime Minister in 2010, which he paid full UK tax on.[337] David Cameron argued that the fund was set up in Panama so that people who wanted to invest in dollar-denominated shares and companies could do so, and because full UK tax was paid on all profits he made there was no impropriety.[338] Thousands of protesters held two marches in London in April 2016 to demand Cameron's resignation.[339][340] In 2009, the New Statesman estimated his wealth at \u00a33.2 million, adding that Cameron is expected to inherit \"million-pound legacies\" from both sides of his family.[341] Before becoming prime minister, Cameron regularly used his bicycle to commute to work. In early 2006, he was photographed cycling to work, followed by his driver in a car carrying his belongings. His Conservative Party spokesperson subsequently said that this was a regular arrangement for Cameron at the time.[342] Cameron is an occasional jogger and in 2009 raised funds for charities by taking part in the Oxford 5K and the Great Brook Run.[343] Cameron supports Aston Villa.[344] He is also a keen cricket fan and has appeared on Test Match Special.[345] At a Q&A in August 2013, Cameron described himself as a practising Christian and an active member of the Church of England.[346] On religious faith in general he said: \"I do think that organised religion can get things wrong but the Church of England and the other churches do play a very important role in society.\"[347] He said he considers the Bible \"a sort of handy guide\" on morality.[348] He viewed Britain as a \"Christian country\" and aimed to put faith back into politics.[349]",

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Witney from 2001 to 2016 and leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016. He identifies as a one-nation conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies.\nBorn in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, and succeeded Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats \u2013 the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s.[1] His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare.[2] It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales.\nInternationally, his government intervened militarily in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority in the 2015 general election he remained as Prime Minister, this time leading a Conservative-only government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote,[3] he resigned to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May.[3][4]\nCameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for decreasing the United Kingdom's national deficit. However, he has been the target of criticism surrounding his decision to hold the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU which led to period of political instability in the UK during the late 2010s.[5][6][7] He has also been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of elitism and political opportunism.\nCameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron (1932\u20132010) a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur (n\u00e9e Mount; born 1934),[8] a retired Justice of the Peace and a daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet.[9] Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962.[8] The journalist Toby Young has described Cameron's background as being \"upper-upper-middle class\".[10]\nCameron was born in Marylebone, London,[11] and raised at Peasemore in Berkshire.[12] He has a brother, Alexander Cameron QC (born 1963), a barrister,[13] and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).[8][14]\nHis father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010;[15] Ian was born with both legs deformed, and underwent repeated operations to correct this. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,[16][17] who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.[18] Blairmore was sold soon after Ian's birth.[17]\nCameron has said, \"On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh, and English.\"[19] He has also referenced the German-Jewish ancestry of one of his great-grandfathers, Arthur Levita, a descendant of the Yiddish author Elia Levita.[20][21]\nFrom the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two independent schools: at Heatherdown School in Winkfield (near Ascot) in Berkshire, which counts Prince Andrew and Prince Edward among its old boys. Owing to good grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early.[22] At the age of thirteen he went on to Eton College in Berkshire, following his father and elder brother.[23] His early interest was in art. Six weeks before taking his O-Levels he was caught smoking cannabis.[24] He admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled; instead he was fined, prevented from leaving the school grounds, and given a \"Georgic\" (a punishment that involved copying 500 lines of Latin text).[25]\nCameron passed twelve O-Levels and then three A-levels: History of art; History, in which he was taught by Michael Kidson; and Economics with Politics. He obtained three 'A' grades and a '1' grade in the Scholarship Level exam in Economics and Politics.[26] The following autumn, he passed the entrance exam for the University of Oxford, and was offered an exhibition at Brasenose College.[27]\nAfter leaving Eton in 1984,[28] Cameron started a nine-month gap year. For three months he worked as a researcher for his godfather Tim Rathbone, then Conservative MP for Lewes, during which time he attended debates in the House of Commons.[29] Through his father, he was then employed for a further three months in Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson as a 'ship jumper', an administrative post.[30]\nReturning from Hong Kong, Cameron visited the then Soviet Union, where he was approached by two Russian men speaking fluent English. Cameron was later told by one of his professors that it was \"definitely an attempt\" by the KGB to recruit him.[31]\nIn October 1985, Cameron began his Bachelor of Arts course in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford.[32] His tutor, Professor Vernon Bogdanor, has described him as \"one of the ablest\" students he has taught,[33] with \"moderate and sensible Conservative\" political views.[14]\nGuy Spier, who shared tutorials with him, remembers him as an outstanding student: \"We were doing our best to grasp basic economic concepts. David\u2014there was nobody else who came even close. He would be integrating them with the way the British political system is put together. He could have lectured me on it, and I would have sat there and taken notes.\"[34] When commenting in 2006 on his former pupil's ideas about a \"Bill of Rights\" to replace the Human Rights Act, however, Professor Bogdanor, himself a Liberal Democrat, said, \"I think he is very confused. I've read his speech and it's filled with contradictions. There are one or two good things in it but one glimpses them, as it were, through a mist of misunderstanding\".[35]\nWhile at Oxford, Cameron was a member of the Bullingdon Club, a student dining society that has a reputation for an outlandish drinking culture associated with boisterous behaviour and damaging property.[36] Cameron's period in the Bullingdon Club was examined in a Channel 4 docu-drama, When Boris Met Dave.\nCameron graduated in 1988 with a first-class honours BA degree (later promoted to an MA by seniority).[37]\nAfter graduation, Cameron worked for the Conservative Research Department between September 1988 and 1993. His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation; he befriended fellow young colleagues, including Edward Llewellyn, Ed Vaizey and Rachel Whetstone. They and others formed a group they called the \"Smith Square set\", which was dubbed the \"Brat Pack\" by the press, though it is better known as the \"Notting Hill set\", a name given to it pejoratively by Derek Conway.[38] In 1991, Cameron was seconded to Downing Street to work on briefing John Major for the then twice-weekly sessions of Prime Minister's Questions. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for \"sharper\u00a0... Despatch box performances\" by Major,[39] which included highlighting for Major \"a dreadful piece of doublespeak\" by Tony Blair (then the Labour Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national minimum wage.[40] He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow Judith Chaplin as Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.[41]\nHowever, Cameron lost to Jonathan Hill, who was appointed in March 1992. Instead, Cameron was given the responsibility for briefing Major for his press conferences during the 1992 general election.[42] During the campaign, Cameron was one of the young \"brat pack\" of party strategists who worked between 12 and 20 hours a day, sleeping in the house of Alan Duncan in Gayfere Street, Westminster, which had been Major's campaign headquarters during his bid for the Conservative leadership.[43] Cameron headed the economic section; it was while working on this campaign that Cameron first worked closely with and befriended Steve Hilton, who was later to become Director of Strategy during his party leadership.[44] The strain of getting up at 04:45 every day was reported to have led Cameron to decide to leave politics in favour of journalism.[45]\nThe Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues, saying \"whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right\", and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across Smith Square to jeer at Transport House, the former Labour headquarters.[46] Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont.[47]\nCameron was working for Lamont at the time of Black Wednesday, when pressure from currency speculators forced the pound sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference, Cameron had difficulty trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion, Patricia Morris, to contact him.[48] Later that month, Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the Christian Democratic Union; he was reported to be \"still smarting\" over the Bundesbank's contribution to the economic crisis.[49]\nLamont fell out with John Major after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 Budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to Conservative Campaign Headquarters for their political acceptability to be assessed.[50] By May 1993, the Conservatives' average poll rating dropped below 30%, where they would remain until the 1997 general election.[51] Major and Lamont's personal ratings also declined dramatically. However, Lamont's unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron, who was considered as a potential \"kamikaze\" candidate for the Newbury by-election, which includes the area where he grew up.[52] However, he decided not to stand.\nDuring the by-election, Lamont gave the response \"Je ne regrette rien\" to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see \"the green shoots of recovery\" or admitting to \"singing in his bath\" with happiness at leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this gaffe; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming Chancellor himself, even though as he was not a Member of Parliament he could not have been.[53] Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.[54]\nAfter Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the Treasury for less than a month before being specifically recruited by Home Secretary Michael Howard. It was commented that he was still \"very much in favour\"[55] and it was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on.[56] At the beginning of September 1993, Cameron applied to go on Conservative Central Office's list of prospective parliamentary candidates (PPCs).[57]\nCameron was much more socially liberal than Howard but enjoyed working for him.[51] According to Derek Lewis, then Director-General of Her Majesty's Prison Service, Cameron showed him a \"his and her list\" of proposals made by Howard and his wife, Sandra. Lewis said that Sandra Howard's list included reducing the quality of prison food, although she denied this claim. Lewis reported that Cameron was \"uncomfortable\" about the list.[58] In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist Bruce Anderson wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase \"balanced diet\", and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.[59]\nDuring his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed the media. In March 1994, someone leaked to the press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the Prevention of Terrorism Act. After an inquiry failed to find the source of the leak, Labour MP Peter Mandelson demanded assurance from Howard that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave.[60][61] A senior Home Office civil servant noted the influence of Howard's Special Advisers, saying previous incumbents \"would listen to the evidence before making a decision. Howard just talks to young public school gentlemen from the party headquarters.\"[62]\nIn July 1994, Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications.[63] Carlton, which had won the ITV franchise for London weekdays in 1991, was a growing media company which also had film-distribution and video-producing arms. Cameron was suggested for the role to Carlton executive chairman Michael P. Green by his later mother-in-law Lady Astor.[64] Cameron left Carlton to run for Parliament in 1997, returning to his job after his defeat.\nIn 1997, Cameron played up the company's prospects for digital terrestrial television, for which it joined with ITV Granada and Sky to form British Digital Broadcasting. In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998 he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry.[65] Carlton's consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers. Cameron resigned as Director of Corporate Affairs in February 2001 in order to run for Parliament for a second time, although he remained on the payroll as a consultant.\nHaving been approved for the PPCs' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the 1997 general election. He was reported to have missed out on selection for Ashford in December 1994, after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays.[66] In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for Stafford, a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority.[51][67] The incumbent Conservative MP, Bill Cash, ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of Stone, where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called for tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to \"small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going\".[68] He also said the Party \"should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements\u00a0... It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda. The socialist Prime Ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion.\"[69]\nWhen writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the single European currency clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations.[70] Otherwise, Cameron kept closely to the national party line. He also campaigned using the claim that a Labour government would increase the cost of a pint of beer by 24p; however, the Labour candidate, David Kidney, portrayed Cameron as \"a right-wing Tory\". Initially Cameron thought he had a 50/50 chance, but as the campaign wore on and the scale of the impending Conservative defeat grew, Cameron prepared himself for defeat.[71] On election day, Stafford had a swing of 10.7%, almost the same as the national swing, which made it one of the many seats to fall to Labour: Kidney defeated Cameron by 24,606 votes (47.5%) to 20,292 (39.2%), a majority of 4,314 (8.3%).[72][73]\nIn the round of selection contests taking place in the run-up to the 2001 general election, Cameron again attempted to be selected for a winnable seat. He tried for the Kensington and Chelsea seat after the death of Alan Clark, but did not make the shortlist. He was in the final two but narrowly lost at Wealden in March 2000,[74] a loss ascribed by Samantha Cameron to his lack of spontaneity when speaking.[75]\nOn 4 April 2000, Cameron was selected as PPC for Witney in Oxfordshire. This had been a safe Conservative seat, but its sitting MP Shaun Woodward (who had worked with Cameron on the 1992 election campaign) had \"crossed the floor\" to join the Labour Party and was selected instead for the safe Labour seat of St Helens South. Cameron's biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning describe the two men as being \"on fairly friendly terms\".[76] Cameron, advised in his strategy by friend Catherine Fall, put a great deal of effort into \"nursing\" his potential constituency, turning up at social functions, and attacking Woodward for changing his mind on fox hunting to support a ban.[77]\nDuring the election campaign, Cameron accepted the offer of writing a regular column for The Guardian's online section.[78] He won the seat with a 1.9% swing to the Conservatives, taking 22,153 votes (45%) to Labour candidate Michael Bartlet's 14,180 (28.8%), a majority of 7,973 (16.2%).[79][80]\nUpon his election to Parliament, he served as a member of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP. Cameron proposed that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs,[81] and urged the consideration of \"radical options\".[82] The report recommended a downgrading of Ecstasy from Class A to Class B, as well as moves towards a policy of 'harm reduction', which Cameron defended.[83]\nCameron endorsed Iain Duncan Smith in the 2001 Conservative Party leadership election and organised an event in Witney for party supporters to hear John Bercow speaking for him.[84] Two days before Duncan Smith won the leadership contest on 13 September 2001, the 9/11 attacks took place in New York City. Cameron described Tony Blair's response to the attacks as \"masterful\", saying \"He moved fast, and set the agenda both at home and abroad. He correctly identified the problem of Islamist extremism, the inadequacy of our response both domestically and internationally, and supported \u2013 quite rightly in my view \u2013 the action to remove the Taliban regime from Afghanistan.\"[85]\nCameron determinedly attempted to increase his public visibility, offering quotations on matters of public controversy. He opposed the payment of compensation to Gurbux Singh, who had resigned as head of the Commission for Racial Equality after a confrontation with the police;[86] and commented that the Home Affairs Select Committee had taken a long time to discuss whether the phrase \"black market\" should be used.[87] However, he was passed over for a front-bench promotion in July 2002; Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith did invite Cameron and his ally George Osborne to coach him on Prime Minister's Questions in November 2002. The next week, Cameron deliberately abstained in a vote on allowing same-sex and unmarried couples to adopt children jointly, against a whip to oppose; his abstention was noted.[88] The wide scale of abstentions and rebellious votes destabilised the Duncan Smith leadership.\nIn June 2003, Cameron was appointed a shadow minister in the Privy Council Office as a deputy to Eric Forth, then Shadow Leader of the House. He also became a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party when Michael Howard took over the leadership in November of that year. He was appointed Opposition frontbench local government spokesman in 2004, before being promoted to the Shadow Cabinet that June as head of policy co-ordination. Later, he became Shadow Education Secretary in the post-election reshuffle.[89]\nDaniel Finkelstein has said of the period leading up to Cameron's election as leader of the Conservative party that \"a small group of us (myself, David Cameron, George Osborne, Michael Gove, Nick Boles, Nick Herbert I think, once or twice) used to meet up in the offices of Policy Exchange, eat pizza, and consider the future of the Conservative Party\".[90] Cameron's relationship with Osborne is regarded as particularly close; Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi suggested the closeness of Osborne's relationship with Cameron meant the two effectively shared power during Cameron's time as Prime Minister.[91]\nFrom February 2002 to August 2005 he was a non-executive director of Urbium PLC, operator of the Tiger Tiger bar chain.[92]\nFollowing the Labour victory in the May 2005 general election, Michael Howard announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and set a lengthy timetable for the leadership election. Cameron announced on 29 September 2005 that he would be a candidate. Parliamentary colleagues supporting him included Boris Johnson, Shadow Chancellor George Osborne, Shadow Defence Secretary and deputy leader of the party Michael Ancram, Oliver Letwin[93] and former party leader William Hague.[94] His campaign did not gain wide support until his speech, delivered without notes, at the 2005 Conservative party conference. In the speech he vowed to make people \"feel good about being Conservatives again\" and said he wanted \"to switch on a whole new generation.\"[95] His speech was well-received; The Daily Telegraph said speaking without notes \"showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit\".[96]\nIn the first ballot of Conservative MPs on 18 October 2005, Cameron came second, with 56 votes, slightly more than expected; David Davis had fewer than predicted at 62 votes; Liam Fox came third with 42 votes; and Kenneth Clarke was eliminated with 38 votes. In the second ballot on 20 October 2005, Cameron came first with 90 votes; David Davis was second, with 57; and Liam Fox was eliminated with 51 votes.[97] All 198 Conservative MPs voted in both ballots.\nThe next stage of the election process, between Davis and Cameron, was a vote open to the entire party membership. Cameron was elected with more than twice as many votes as Davis and more than half of all ballots issued; Cameron won 134,446 votes on a 78% turnout, to Davis's 64,398.[98] Although Davis had initially been the favourite, it was widely acknowledged that his candidacy was marred by a disappointing conference speech.[99] Cameron's election as the Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition was announced on 6 December 2005. As is customary for an Opposition leader not already a member, upon election Cameron became a member of the Privy Council, being formally approved to join on 14 December 2005, and sworn of the Council on 8 March 2006.[100]\nCameron's relative youth and inexperience before becoming leader invited satirical comparison with Tony Blair. Private Eye soon published a picture of both leaders on its front cover, with the caption \"World's first face transplant a success\".[101] On the left, the New Statesman unfavourably likened his \"new style of politics\" to Tony Blair's early leadership years.[102] Cameron was accused of paying excessive attention to appearance: ITV News broadcast footage from the 2006 Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth shows him wearing four different sets of clothes within a few hours.[103] In his Guardian column, comedy writer and broadcaster Charlie Brooker described the Conservative leader as \"a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside\" in April 2007.[104]\nOn the right of the party, Norman Tebbit, the former Conservative chairman, likened Cameron to Pol Pot, \"intent on purging even the memory of Thatcherism before building a New Modern Compassionate Green Globally Aware Party\".[105] Quentin Davies MP, who defected from the Conservatives to Labour on 26 June 2007, branded him \"superficial, unreliable and [with] an apparent lack of any clear convictions\" and stated that David Cameron had turned the Conservative Party's mission into a \"PR agenda\".[106] Traditionalist conservative columnist and author Peter Hitchens wrote, \"Mr Cameron has abandoned the last significant difference between his party and the established left\", by embracing social liberalism.[107] Daily Telegraph correspondent and blogger Gerald Warner was particularly scathing about Cameron's leadership, saying that it alienated traditionalist conservative elements from the Conservative Party.[108]\nBefore he became Conservative leader, Cameron was reportedly known to friends and family as \"Dave\", though his preference is \"David\" in public.[109][110]  Labour used the slogan Dave the Chameleon in their 2006 local elections party broadcast to portray Cameron as an ever-changing populist, which was criticised as negative campaigning by the Conservative press including The Daily Telegraph,[111] though Cameron asserted the broadcast had become his daughter's \"favourite video\".[112]\nDuring the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used cannabis and cocaine recreationally before becoming an MP.[113] Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme Question Time, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to \"err and stray\" in their past.[114] During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking that \"I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn't have done. We all did.\"[114]\nHis Shadow Cabinet appointments included MPs associated with the various wings of the party. Former leader William Hague was appointed to the Foreign Affairs brief, while both George Osborne and David Davis were retained, as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and Shadow Home Secretary respectively. Hague, assisted by Davis, stood in for Cameron during his paternity leave in February 2006.[115] In June 2008, Davis announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary by Dominic Grieve; Davis' surprise move was seen as a challenge to the changes introduced under Cameron's leadership.[116]\nA reshuffle of the Shadow Cabinet was undertaken in January 2009. The chief change was the appointment of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke as Shadow Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Secretary, David Cameron stating that \"With Ken Clarke's arrival, we now have the best economic team.\" The reshuffle also saw eight other changes made.[117]\nDuring his successful 2005 campaign to be elected Leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron pledged that the Conservative Party's Members of the European Parliament would leave the European People's Party group, which had a \"federalist\" approach to the European Union.[118] Once elected Cameron began discussions with right-wing and Eurosceptic parties in other European countries, mainly in eastern Europe, and in July 2006 he concluded an agreement to form the Movement for European Reform with the Czech Civic Democratic Party, leading to the formation of a new European Parliament group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, in 2009 after the European Parliament elections.[119]\nCameron attended a gathering at Warsaw's Palladium cinema celebrating the foundation of the alliance.[120]\nIn forming the caucus, which had 54 MEPs drawn from eight of the 27 EU member states, Cameron reportedly broke with two decades of Conservative co-operation with the centre-right Christian Democrats, the European People's Party (EPP),[121] on the grounds that they are dominated by European federalists and supporters of the Lisbon treaty.[121] EPP leader Wilfried Martens, former Prime Minister of Belgium, has stated \"Cameron's campaign has been to take his party back to the centre in every policy area with one major exception: Europe.\u00a0... I can't understand his tactics. Merkel and Sarkozy will never accept his Euroscepticism.\"[121]\nSimilarly, Cameron's initial \"A-List\" of prospective parliamentary candidates was attacked by members of his party,[122] and the policy was discontinued in favour of sex-balanced final shortlists. Before being discontinued, the policy had been criticised by senior Conservative MP and former Prisons Spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe as an \"insult to women\", and she had accused Cameron of \"storing up huge problems for the future.\"[123]\nIn April 2009, The Independent reported that in 1989, while Nelson Mandela remained imprisoned under the apartheid regime, David Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm. A spokesperson for Cameron responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to sanctions against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip \"jolly\", saying that \"it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The Botha regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence.\" Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime. He was criticised by Labour MP Peter Hain, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner.[124]\nAt the launch of the Conservative Party's education manifesto in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the \"brazenly elite\" approach to education of countries such as Singapore and South Korea and expressed a desire to \"elevate the status of teaching in our country\".[125] He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from \"good\" universities.[126]\nWes Streeting, then president of the National Union of Students, said \"The message that the Conservatives are sending to the majority of students is that if you didn't go to a university attended by members of the Shadow Cabinet, they don't believe you're worth as much.\"[127]\n\nDuring the MPs expenses scandal in 2009, Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying \"excessive\" expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:We have to acknowledge just how bad this is, the public are really angry and we have to start by saying, \"Look, this system that we have, that we used, that we operated, that we took part in\u2014it was wrong and we are sorry about that\".[128]One day later, The Daily Telegraph published figures showing over five years he had claimed \u00a382,450 on his second home allowance.[129] Cameron repaid \u00a3680 claimed for repairs to his constituency home.[130] Although he was not accused of breaking any rules, Cameron was placed on the defensive over mortgage interest expense claims covering his constituency home, after a report in The Mail on Sunday suggested he could have reduced the mortgage interest bill by putting an additional \u00a375,000 of his own money towards purchasing the home in Witney instead of paying off an earlier mortgage on his London home.[131] Cameron said that doing things differently would not have saved the taxpayer any money, as he was paying more on mortgage interest than he was able to reclaim as expenses anyway[131] He also spoke out in favour of laws giving voters the power to \"recall\" or \"sack\" MPs accused of wrongdoing.[131] In April 2014, he was criticised for his handling of the expenses row surrounding Culture Secretary Maria Miller, when he rejected calls from fellow Conservative MPs to sack her from the front bench.[132]\nThe Conservatives had last won a general election in 1992. The 2010 general election resulted in the Conservatives, led by Cameron, winning the largest number of seats (306). This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority and resulted in the nation's first hung parliament since February 1974.[133]\nTalks between Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition. Cameron in late 2009 had urged the Liberal Democrats to join the Conservatives in a new \"national movement\" saying there was \"barely a cigarette paper\" between them on a large number of issues. The invitation was rejected at the time by the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, who said that the Conservatives were totally different from his party and that the Lib Dems were the true \"progressives\" in UK politics.[134]\nOn 11 May 2010, following the resignation of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister and on his recommendation, Queen Elizabeth II invited Cameron to form a government.[135] At age 43, Cameron became the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, beating the record previously set by Tony Blair in May 1997.[1] In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats.\nCameron outlined how he intended to \"put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest.\"[1] As one of his first moves Cameron appointed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as Deputy Prime Minister on 11 May 2010.[135] Between them, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats controlled 363 seats in the House of Commons, with a majority of 76 seats.[136]\nIn June 2010 Cameron described the economic situation as he came to power as \"even worse than we thought\" and warned of \"difficult decisions\" to be made over spending cuts.[137] By the beginning of 2015 he was able to claim that his government's austerity programme had succeeded in halving the budget deficit, although as a percentage of GDP rather than in cash terms.[138][139]\nIn December 2010, Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.[140][141]\nCameron agreed to holding the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and eliminated the \"devomax\" option from the ballot for a straight out yes or no vote. His support for the successful Better Together campaign extended to making a successful request to the Queen to intervene.[142] He had also backed a successful campaign to retain the status quo in a referendum on changing the voting system held at the request of his coalition partners.\nHe supported the introduction of gay marriage despite more of his own Conservative MPs voting against the move than for it, meaning the support of Lib Dem MPs in government and Labour MPs in opposition was required to allow it to pass.[143]\nEarlier in his term he had managed to secure a huge majority for UK participation in UN-backed military action in Libya,[144] but Cameron became the first prime minister since 1782 to lose a foreign policy vote in the House of Commons over proposed military action against Assad's regime in Syria.[145][146] Subsequently, Barack Obama asked congressional approval,[147] which was not ultimately granted.\nIn response to the Great Recession, Cameron undertook the austerity programme. This was a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the welfare state in the United Kingdom. The National Health Service[149] and education[150] have been \"ringfenced\" and protected from direct spending cuts.[151] Together with Chancellor George Osborne, Cameron aimed to eliminate the structural deficit (i.e. deficit on current spending as opposed to investment) and to have government debt falling as a percentage of GDP.[152] By 2015, the deficit as a percentage of GDP had been reduced to half what it was in 2010, and the sale of government assets (mostly the shares of banks nationalised in the 2000s) had resulted in government debt as a proportion of GDP falling.[152]\nCameron said immigration from outside the EU should be subject to annual limits. He said in July 2013 that \"in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax. The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.\"[153] In 2015, The Independent reported, \"The Conservatives have failed spectacularly to deliver their pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014\u2014up from 210,000 in the previous year.\"[154]\nIn 2014, Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a \"first class-player in terms of defence\" and no longer a \"full partner\" to the United States.[155]\nIn the July 2015 budget Chancellor George Osborne announced that the UK defence spending would meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP.[156]\nCameron condemned the violence used against anti-Gaddafi protesters at the beginning of the Libyan Civil War[157] After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011 the United Nations Security Council approved a no-fly zone to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi rebels.[158] Two days later the UK and the United States fired more than 110 Tomahawk missiles at targets in Libya.[159]\nCameron said he was \"proud\" of the role United Kingdom played in the overthrow of Gaddafi's government.[160] Cameron also stated that UK had played a \"very important role\",[161] adding that \"a lot of people said that Tripoli was completely different to Benghazi and that the two don't get on\u2014they were wrong.\u00a0... People who said 'this is all going to be an enormous swamp of Islamists and extremists'\u2014they were wrong\".[162]\nIn 2015 through 2016 the Foreign Affairs Select Committee conducted an extensive and highly critical inquiry into the British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By mid-2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of regime change. However that new policy did not include proper support and for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya and the growth of ISIL in North Africa. It concluded that Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure.[163][164][165]\nUS President Barack Obama also acknowledged there had been issues with following up the conflict planning, commenting in an interview with The Atlantic magazine that Cameron had allowed himself to be \"distracted by a range of other things\".[166][167][168]\nIn 2013, in response to Argentina's calls for negotiations over the Falkland Islands' sovereignty, a referendum was called asking Falkland Islanders whether they supported the continuation of their status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom.  With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory with only three votes against.[169]\nIn light of this, Cameron said: \"We believe in the Falkland islanders' right to self-determination. They had a referendum. They couldn't have been more clear about wanting to remain with our country and we should protect and defend them\".[170]\nCameron supported Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia.[171] In January 2015, Cameron travelled to the Saudi capital Riyadh to pay his respects following the death of the nation's King Abdullah.\nAccording to WikiLeaks, Cameron initiated a secret deal with Saudi Arabia ensuring both countries were elected onto the U.N. Human Rights Council.[172] In 2015, Cameron's government announced \"firm political support\" for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shi'a Houthis,[173] re-supplying the Saudi military with weapons and providing them with training.[174][175][176]\nCameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War.[177] \"There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the Tamil minority in that country\" Cameron stated.[178][179] He stated that, if this investigation was not completed by March 2014, he would press for an independent international inquiry.[180][181][182] This followed a visit to Jaffna, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of Sri Lanka; Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948.[183][184] Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing missing relatives.[185][186]\nIn a speech in Ankara in July 2010, Cameron stated unequivocally his support for Turkey's accession to the EU, citing economic, security and political considerations, and claimed that those who opposed Turkish membership were driven by \"protectionism, narrow nationalism or prejudice\".[187][188] In that speech, he was also critical of Israeli action during the Gaza flotilla raid and its Gaza policy, and repeated his opinion that Israel had turned Gaza into a \"prison camp\",[187] having previously referred to Gaza as \"a giant open prison\".[189] These views were met with mixed reactions.[190][191][192] The Cameron government declined to formally recognise the Ottoman Empire's massacres of Armenians as a \"genocide\".[193]\nDuring the EU referendum campaign, Cameron stated that Turkey was unlikely to be ready to join the EU 'until the year 3000' at its current rate of progress.[194]\nAt the end of May 2011, Cameron stepped down as patron of the Jewish National Fund,[195][196] becoming the first British prime minister not to be patron of the charity in the 110 years of its existence.[197]\nIn a speech in 2011 Cameron said: \"You have a Prime Minister whose commitment and determination to work for peace in Israel is deep and strong. Britain will continue to push for peace, but will always stand up for Israel against those who wish her harm\". He said he wanted to reaffirm his \"unshakable\" belief in Israel within the same message.[198] He also voiced his opposition to the Goldstone Report, claiming it had been biased against Israel and not enough blame had been placed on Hamas.\nIn March 2014, during his first visit to Israel as Prime Minister, Cameron addressed Israel's Knesset in Jerusalem, where he offered his full support for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians, hoping a two-state solution might be achieved.[199] He also made clear his rejection of trade or academic boycotts against Israel,[200] acknowledged Israel's right to defend its citizens as \"a right enshrined in international law,\" and made note of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, as \"the moment when the State of Israel went from a dream to a plan, Britain has played a proud and vital role in helping to secure Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people.\"[199] During his two-day visit, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.[201] Senior Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi resigned over the Cameron government's decision not to condemn Israel for the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, saying that the government's \"approach and language during the current crisis in Gaza is morally indefensible.\"[202]\nIn August 2013, Cameron lost a motion in favour of bombing Syrian armed forces in response to the Ghouta chemical attack, becoming the first prime minister to suffer such a foreign-policy defeat since 1782.[203] In September 2014, MPs passed a motion in favour of British planes joining, at the request of the Iraqi government, a bombing campaign against Islamic State (IS) targets in Iraq;[204] the motion explicitly expressed parliament's disapproval of UK military action in Syria.[205] Cameron promised that, before expanding UK air strikes to include IS units in Syria, he would seek parliamentary approval.[206]\nIn July 2015, a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by Reprieve revealed that, without the knowledge of UK parliamentarians, RAF pilots had, in fact, been bombing targets in Syria, and that Cameron knew of this.[207][208] The prime minister, along with Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, faced strong criticism, including from Conservative MPs, for not informing the Commons about this deployment; the Ministry of Defence said that the pilots concerned were \"embedded\" with foreign military forces, and so were \"effectively\" operating as such, while Fallon denied that MPs had been, as he put it, \"kept in the dark\".[209][210][211] The Reprieve FoI request also revealed that British drone pilots had been embedded, almost continuously, with American forces at Creech Air Force Base since 2008. These drone operators, who were \"a gift of services\", meaning the UK still paid their salaries and covered their expenses, had been carrying out operations that included reconnaissance in Syria to assist American strikes against IS.[212]\nFallon said that it was \"illogical\" for the UK not to bomb ISIL in Syria, for the organisation does not \"differentiate between Syria and Iraq\" and is \"organised and directed and administered from Syria\".[213] Following the terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility, Cameron began pushing for a strategy for the Royal Air Force to bomb Syria in retaliation.[214] Cameron set out his case for military intervention to Parliament on 26 November, telling MPs that it was the only way to guarantee Britain's safety and would be part of a \"comprehensive\" strategy to defeat IS.[215] On 3 December 2015 MPs voted 397\u2013223 in favour of launching air strikes against ISIL targets in Syria. The vote for military action was supported by all but seven members of the Parliamentary Conservative Party, as well as 66 Labour MPs who backed the government in defiance of their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who had expressed his opposition to air strikes.[216]\nOn 7 May 2015, Cameron was re-elected UK Prime Minister with a majority in the Commons. The Conservative Party's decisive win in the general election was as a surprise victory, as most polls and commentators predicted the outcome would be too close to call and result in a second hung parliament.[217] Cameron said of his first term when returned as Prime Minister for a second term that he was \"proud to lead the first coalition government in 70 years\" and offered particular thanks to Clegg for his role in it.[218] Forming the first Conservative majority government since 1992, David Cameron became the first Prime Minister to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a larger popular vote share since Lord Salisbury at the 1900 general election.\nIn response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, Cameron secured the support of the House of Commons to extend air strikes against ISIS into Syria.[219] Earlier that year, Cameron had outlined a five-year strategy to counter Islamist extremism and subversive teachings.[220]\nAs promised in the election manifesto, Cameron set a date for a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union, and announced that he would be campaigning for Britain to remain within a \"reformed EU\".[221] The terms of the UK's membership of the EU were re-negotiated, with agreement reached in February 2016.[222]\nThe referendum came to be known as Brexit (a portmanteau of \"British\" and \"exit\") and was held on 23 June 2016. The result was approximately 52% in favour of leaving the European Union and 48% against, with a turnout of 72%.[223][224] On 24 June, a few hours after the results became known, Cameron announced that he would resign the office of Prime Minister by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016. In a speech the next day outside 10 Downing Street, he stated that, on account of his own advocacy on behalf of remaining in the EU, \"I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\"[3][225][226]\nThere was some strong criticism made of Cameron and his government following the referendum. Matthew Norman, in an opinion piece in The Independent, called the referendum an act of \"indescribably selfish recklessness.\"[227] In late July, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee was told that Cameron had refused to allow the Civil Service to make plans for Brexit, a decision the committee described as \"an act of gross negligence.\"[228] His farewell speech as he left No 10 accompanied by his family stressed the value of selfless public service.[229]\nThe Conservative Party leadership election was scheduled for 9 September and the new leader was expected to be in place by the autumn conference, set to begin on 2 October.[230] On 11 July, following the withdrawal of Andrea Leadsom from the Conservative Party leadership election and the confirmation of Theresa May as the new leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron announced he would hold a final cabinet meeting on 12 July and then following a final Prime Minister's Questions submit his resignation to the Queen on the afternoon of 13 July. After his final Prime Minister's Questions, Cameron received a standing ovation from MPs; his final comment was, \"I was the future once\" \u2013 a reference to his 2005 quip to Tony Blair, \"he was the future once\". Cameron then submitted his resignation to the Queen later that day.[231]\nAlthough no longer serving as Prime Minister, Cameron originally stated that he would continue inside Parliament, on the Conservative backbenches.[232] On 12 September, however, he announced that he was resigning his seat with immediate effect,[233] and was appointed to the Manor of Northstead. He was succeeded as MP for Witney by fellow Conservative Robert Courts.[234] The Washington Post described him as having \"sped away without glancing back\" once Theresa May had \"vaulted herself out of the hurricane-strength political wreckage of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.\"[235]\nCameron described himself in December 2005 as a \"modern compassionate conservative\" and spoke of a need for a new style of politics, saying that he was \"fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster\".[236] He was \"certainly a big Thatcher fan, but I don't know whether that makes me a Thatcherite\",[237] claiming to be a \"liberal Conservative\", though \"not a deeply ideological person.\"[238]  As Leader of the Opposition, Cameron asserted that he did not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and would offer his support in areas of agreement. He has urged politicians to concentrate more on improving people's happiness and \"general well-being\", instead of focusing solely on \"financial wealth\".[239] There were claims that he described himself to journalists at a dinner during the leadership contest as the \"heir to Blair\".[240]\nIn his first Conservative conference speech as party leader in Bournemouth in 2006, he described the National Health Service as \"one of the 20th Century's greatest achievements\". He went on to say, \"Tony Blair explained his priorities in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters: N.H.S.\" He also talked about his severely disabled son, Ivan, concluding \"So, for me, it is not just a question of saying the NHS is safe in my hands\u2014of course it will be. My family is so often in the hands of the NHS, so I want them to be safe there.\"[241]\nCameron said that he believed in \"spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention\" in cases such as the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. However, he rejected neo-conservatism because, as a conservative, he recognises \"the complexities of human nature, and will always be sceptical of grand schemes to remake the world.\"[242] A supporter of multilateralism as \"a country may act alone\u2014but it cannot always succeed alone\", he believes multilateralism can take the form of acting through \"NATO, the UN, the G8, the EU and other institutions\", or through international alliances.[243] Cameron said that \"If the West is to help other countries, we must do so from a position of genuine moral authority\" and \"we must strive above all for legitimacy in what we do.\"[243]\nHe believes that British Muslims have a duty to integrate into British culture, but noted in an article published in 2007 that the Muslim community finds aspects such as high divorce rates and drug use uninspiring, and that \"Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around.\"[244] In his first speech as PM on radicalisation and the causes of terrorism in February 2011, Cameron said that 'state multiculturalism' had failed.[245] In 2010 he appointed the first Muslim member of the British cabinet, Baroness Warsi, as a minister without portfolio, and in 2012 made her a special minister of state in foreign affairs. She resigned, however, in August 2014 over the government's handling of the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.\nWhilst urging members of his party to support the coalition's proposals for same-sex marriage, Cameron said that he backed gay marriage not in spite of his conservatism but because he is a conservative, and claimed it was about equality.[246] In 2012, Cameron publicly apologised for Thatcher-era policies on homosexuality, specifically the introduction of the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which he described as \"a mistake\".[247]\nIn 2006 Cameron described poverty as a \"moral disgrace\"[248] and promised to tackle relative poverty.[249] In 2007 Cameron promised, \"We can make British poverty history, and we will make British poverty history\". Also in 2007 he stated \"Ending child poverty is central to improving child well-being\".[250] In 2015 Polly Toynbee questioned Cameron's commitment to tackling poverty, contrasting his earlier statements agreeing that \"poverty is relative\" with proposals to change the government's poverty measure, and saying that cuts in child tax credits would increase child poverty among low-paid working families.[251] Cameron denied that austerity had contributed to the 2011 England riots, instead blaming street gangs and opportunistic looters.[252]\nIn 2010 Cameron was given a score of 36% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall.[253] Prior to 2005,  Cameron was opposed to gay rights, calling it a \"fringe agenda\" and attacking the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair for \"moving heaven and earth to allow the promotion of homosexuality in our schools\" by repealing the anti-gay Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988.[254] Cameron is also recorded by Hansard as having voted against same-sex adoption rights in 2002, but he denies this, claiming he abstained from the three-line whip imposed on him by his party. In 2008, he wanted lesbians who receive IVF treatment to be required to name a father figure, which received condemnation from LGBT equality groups.[254] However, Cameron supported commitment for gay couples in a 2005 speech, and in October 2011 urged Conservative MPs to support gay marriage.[246]\nIn November 2012, Cameron and Nick Clegg agreed to fast-track legislation for introducing same-sex marriage.[255] Cameron stated that he wanted to give religious groups the ability to host gay marriage ceremonies, and that he did not want to exclude gay people from a \"great institution\".[256] In 2013, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 became law despite opposition from more than half of his fellow Conservative MPs, including Cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and David Jones.[257] He also subsequently appointed two women who had voted against same-sex marriage as ministers in the Government Equalities Office, Nicky Morgan and Caroline Dinenage following the 2015 general election.[258]\nIn August 2013, he rejected calls by Stephen Fry and others to strip Russia from hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics due to its anti-gay laws.[259] Cameron did not attend the games but denied it was a boycott in protest at Russia's laws, having previously raised the issue of gay rights in the country with Vladimir Putin.[260]\nCameron criticised Gordon Brown (when Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer) for being \"an analogue politician in a digital age\" and referred to him as \"the roadblock to reform\".[261] As Prime Minister, he reacted to press reports that Brown could be the next head of the International Monetary Fund by hinting that he may block the appointment, citing the huge national debt that Brown left the country with as a reason for Brown not being suitable for the role.[262]\nHe said that John Prescott \"clearly looks a fool\" after Prescott's personal indiscretions were revealed in spring 2006, and wondered if the Deputy Prime Minister had broken the ministerial code.[263] During a speech to the Ethnic Media Conference in November 2006, Cameron also described Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, as an \"ageing far left politician\" following Livingstone's criticism of Trevor Phillips, head of the Commission for Racial Equality.[264]\nIn 2006, Cameron made a speech in which he described extremist Islamic organisations and the British National Party as \"mirror images\" to each other, both preaching \"creeds of pure hatred\".[265] Cameron is listed as being a supporter of Unite Against Fascism.[266]\nIn April 2006, Cameron accused the UK Independence Party of being \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly\",[267] leading UKIP MEP Nigel Farage (who became leader in September of that year) to demand an apology for the remarks. Right-wing Conservative MP Bob Spink, who later defected to UKIP, also criticised the remarks,[268] as did The Daily Telegraph.[269] Cameron was seen encouraging Conservative MPs to join the standing ovation given to Tony Blair at the end of his last Prime Minister's Question Time; he had paid tribute to the \"huge efforts\" Blair had made and said Blair had \"considerable achievements to his credit, whether it is peace in Northern Ireland or his work in the developing world, which will endure\".[270]\nIn September 2015, after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, Cameron called the party a \"threat\" to British national and economic security, on the basis of Corbyn's defence and fiscal policies.[271]\nIn an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to war in Iraq, and said that he thought supporters should \"see it through\".[272] He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006 calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war. In 2011, he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq. He repeatedly called for the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying \"People want to know the truth\".[273]\nCameron was a strong advocate of increased ties between India and the United Kingdom, describing Indian\u2013British relations as the \"New Special Relationship\" in 2010.[274][275]\nIn October 2012, as Narendra Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK rescinded its boycott of the then-Gujarat state Chief Minister over religious riots in Gujarat in 2002 that left more than 2,000 dead,[276] and in November 2013, Cameron commented that he was \"open\" to meeting Modi.[277] Modi was later elected as Prime Minister in a landslide majority, leading to Cameron calling Modi and congratulating him on the \"election success\",[278] one of the first Western leaders to do so.[279]\nWhile Leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron was accused of reliance on \"old-boy networks\",[280] and conversely attacked by his party for the imposition of selective shortlists of women and ethnic minority prospective parliamentary candidates.[122]\nSome of Cameron's senior appointments, such as George Osborne as Chancellor of the Exchequer, are former members of the Bullingdon Club. Michael Gove conceded it was \"ridiculous\" how many fellow Cabinet ministers were old Etonians, though he placed the blame on the failings of the state education system rather than Cameron.[281] However, Michael Mosbacher, co-founder of Standpoint magazine, wrote that Cameron's Cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: \"David Cameron's government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated\u2014indeed the least Etonian Conservative-led government this country has ever seen\".[282]\nFollowing poor results in the May 2012 local elections after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls, there were concerns from Conservative MPs about Cameron's leadership and his electability. David Davies, the chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, accused the Conservative leadership of \"incompetence\" and hinted that it could risk Cameron's leadership.[283] Nadine Dorries warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen.[284]\nLater that year, Conservative MP Brian Binley openly said that Cameron's leadership was like being a \"maid\" to the Liberal Democrats, and accused him of leading the party to defeat. In January 2013 it was revealed that Adam Afriyie was planning his own bid for the Conservative leadership with the support of fellow MPs Mark Field, Bill Wiggin, Chris Heaton-Harris, Patrick Mercer, Jonathan Djanogly and Dan Byles. The Times and ConservativeHome revealed that a 'rebel reserve' of 55 Conservative MPs gave firm pledges to a co-ordinating MP to support a motion of 'no confidence' and write to Brady simultaneously, more than the 46 MPs needed to trigger a vote of no confidence.[285] Andrew Bridgen openly called for a vote of confidence in Cameron's leadership and claimed that the Prime Minister had a \"credibility problem\" but he dropped his bid for a contest a year later.[286]\nIn 2007 Cameron appointed Andy Coulson, former editor of the News of the World, as his director of communications. Coulson had resigned as the paper's editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to illegal phone hacking, although stating that he knew nothing about it.[287][288] In June 2010 Downing Street confirmed Coulson's annual salary as \u00a3140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government.[289]\nIn January 2011 Coulson left his post, saying coverage of the phone-hacking scandal was making it difficult to give his best to the job.[287] In July 2011 he was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the News of the World, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance.[290] The same month, in a special parliamentary session at the House of Commons, arranged to discuss the News International phone hacking scandal, Cameron said that he \"regretted the furore\" that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that \"with hindsight\" he would not have hired him.[291] Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by Strathclyde Police in May 2012.[292][293] Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a \"full and frank\" apology for hiring him, saying \"I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that.\" The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.[294]\nAlthough Lord Ashcroft played a significant role in the 2010 election, he was not offered a ministerial post.[295] In June 2012, shortly before a major Conservative rebellion on House of Lords reform,[296] journalist Peter Oborne credited Ashcroft with \"stopping the Coalition working\" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education, taxation to the right.[295] According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome websites and a \"brutal critic of the Coalition from the start\", had established \"megaphone presence\" in the on-line media. He believes Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by \"coordinated attacks on the Coalition\" and \"the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together.\"[295]\nIn The Observer, Andrew Rawnsley commented that he believes that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to \"generate publicity\", \"stir trouble for the prime minister\" and influence the direction of the party.[297] In 2015 Ashcroft released Call Me Dave, an unauthorised biography of Cameron written with journalist Isabel Oakeshott, which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron's time at university. The book includes an anonymous anecdote about Cameron, now referred to as Piggate, in which he allegedly inserted his penis into a dead pig's head.  No evidence for the anecdote has been produced. Many commentators have described the accusations as a \"revenge job\" by Ashcroft, who was not offered a senior role in government when Cameron came to power in 2010.[298][299] Ashcroft initially claimed the book was \"not about settling scores\", while Oakeshott said that they had held back publication until after the 2015 general election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives' electoral chances.[300] Ashcroft subsequently admitted that the initiation allegations \"may have been case of mistaken identity\" and has stated that he has a personal \"beef\" with Cameron.[298][299][301][302][303] Cameron later went on to deny these allegations and stated that Ashcroft's reasons for writing the book were clear and the public could see clearly through it.[304]\nAn ICM poll in September 2007 saw Cameron rated the least popular of the three main party leaders.[305][306] A YouGov poll on party leaders conducted on 9\u201310 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, whilst 38% thought he would be the best PM and 35% did not know.[307] In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters thought he was doing well as prime minister compared with 46% who thought he was doing badly.[308]\nIn September 2015, an Opinium poll had similar results to the one shortly before the election, with voters split with 42% who approved of him and 41% who did not.[309] Cameron had significantly better net approval ratings in polls conducting in December and January (getting \u22126 in both) than Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (who got \u221238 and \u221239).[310] However, following the Panama Papers leak in April 2016, his personal approval ratings fell below Corbyn's.[311]\nIn the months immediately following his resignation from the post of Prime Minister, a number of commentators gave negative evaluations of Cameron's premiership. The University of Leeds' 2016 survey of post-War Prime Ministers, which collected the views of 82 academics specialising in the history and politics of post-war Britain, ranked Cameron as the third-worst Prime Minister since 1945, ranking above only Alec Douglas-Home and Anthony Eden. 90 per cent of respondents cited his calling and losing of the Brexit referendum as his greatest failure.[312]\nIn October 2016, Cameron became chairman of the National Citizen Service Patrons.[313] In January 2017, he was appointed president of Alzheimer's Research UK to address misconceptions surrounding dementia and campaign for medical research funding to tackle the condition.[314]\nAll appointments post-premiership have to be approved by the UK government advisory committee. In addition to the two posts above they also approved the following positions:[315]\nCameron maintained a low profile following his resignation as Prime Minister and the subsequent Brexit negotiations. In January 2019, following Theresa May's defeat in the House of Commons over her draft withdrawal agreement, Cameron gave a rare interview to reporters outside his house in Notting Hill, saying he backed May's Brexit deal with the EU and did not regret calling the 2016 referendum.[317] However, he later said that the outcome of the referendum had left him \"hugely depressed\" and told The Times he knew \"some people will never forgive me\". He confessed \"Every single day I think about it, and the fact that we lost, and the consequences, and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately\".[318]\nMonths following Boris Johnson's election as Prime Minister, Cameron began criticising Johnson's Brexit strategy, including his decision to prorogue parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31 October and the removal of the whip from Conservative MPs who voted to block a no-deal Brexit. Additionally, he accused Johnson, as well as Michael Gove, of behaving \"appallingly\" during the referendum campaign of 2016.[318]\nIn January 2019, several news outlets reported that Cameron's political memoir, including an account of his time in office, was more than three-quarters written.[319] This came after Cameron was reported to have signed an \u00a3800,000 contract with William Collins, an imprint of HarperCollins, in 2016.[320] It was widely sourced that Cameron was planning to hold back the release of the book by several years so that he would not be seen as a \"backstreet driver\" in May's handling of Brexit. In May 2019, HarperCollins released the book's title and release date: For the Record, published in hardback, ebook and radio on 19 September.[321][322]\nCameron was portrayed by Mark Dexter in the Channel 4 television films Coalition and Brexit: The Uncivil War.\nCameron is married to Samantha Gwendoline Cameron (n\u00e9e Sheffield), the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet, and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (now Viscountess Astor). A Marlborough College school friend of Cameron's sister Clare, Samantha accepted Clare's invitation to accompany the Cameron family on holiday in Tuscany, Italy, after graduating from Bristol School of Creative Arts. It was then David and Samantha's romance started. They were married on 1 June 1996 at the Church of St Augustine of Canterbury, East Hendred, Oxfordshire, five years before Cameron was elected to parliament.[8]\nThe Camerons have had four children. Their first, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: \"The news hits you like a freight train\u00a0... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you get over that, because he's wonderful.\"[323] Ivan was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after he left it. Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six.[324]\nThe Camerons have two daughters, Nancy Gwen (born 2004) and Florence Rose Endellion (born 2010),[325] and a son, Arthur Elwen (born 2006).[326] Cameron took paternity leave when Arthur was born, and this decision received broad coverage.[327] It was also stated that Cameron would be taking paternity leave after his second daughter was born.[325] She was born on 24 August 2010, three weeks prematurely, while the family was on holiday in Cornwall. Her third given name, Endellion, is taken from the village of St Endellion near where the Camerons were holidaying.[328][329]\nIn early May 2008, the Camerons decided to enrol their daughter Nancy at a state primary school. For three years before that they had been attending its associated church, St Mary Abbots,[330] near the Cameron family home in North Kensington.[331] Cameron's constituency home is in Dean, Oxfordshire, and the Camerons have been described as key members of the Chipping Norton set.[332]\nOn 8 September 2010, it was announced that Cameron would miss Prime Minister's Questions in order to fly to southern France to see his father, Ian Cameron, who had suffered a stroke with coronary complications. Later that day, with David and other family members at his bedside, Ian died.[333] On 17 September 2010, Cameron attended a private ceremony for the funeral of his father in Berkshire, which prevented him from hearing the address of Pope Benedict XVI in Westminster Hall, an occasion he would otherwise have attended.[334]\nIn October 2010, David Cameron inherited \u00a3300,000 from his father's estate. Ian Cameron, who had worked as a stockbroker in the City of London, used multimillion-pound investment funds based in offshore tax havens, such as Jersey, Panama City, and Geneva, to increase the family wealth. In 1982, Ian Cameron created the Panamanian Blairmore Holdings, an offshore investment fund, valued at about $20 million in 1988, \"not liable to taxation on its income or capital gains\", which used bearer shares until 2006.[335]\nIn April 2016, following the Panama Papers financial documents leak, David Cameron faced calls to resign after it was revealed that he and his wife Samantha invested in Ian Cameron's offshore fund.[336] He owned \u00a331,500 of shares in the fund and sold them for a profit of \u00a319,000 shortly before becoming Prime Minister in 2010, which he paid full UK tax on.[337] David Cameron argued that the fund was set up in Panama so that people who wanted to invest in dollar-denominated shares and companies could do so, and because full UK tax was paid on all profits he made there was no impropriety.[338] Thousands of protesters held two marches in London in April 2016 to demand Cameron's resignation.[339][340]\nIn 2009, the New Statesman estimated his wealth at \u00a33.2 million, adding that Cameron is expected to inherit \"million-pound legacies\" from both sides of his family.[341]\nBefore becoming prime minister, Cameron regularly used his bicycle to commute to work. In early 2006, he was photographed cycling to work, followed by his driver in a car carrying his belongings. His Conservative Party spokesperson subsequently said that this was a regular arrangement for Cameron at the time.[342]\nCameron is an occasional jogger and in 2009 raised funds for charities by taking part in the Oxford 5K and the Great Brook Run.[343]\nCameron supports Aston Villa.[344]  He is also a keen cricket fan and has appeared on Test Match Special.[345]\nAt a Q&amp;A in August 2013, Cameron described himself as a practising Christian and an active member of the Church of England.[346] On religious faith in general he said: \"I do think that organised religion can get things wrong but the Church of England and the other churches do play a very important role in society.\"[347] He said he considers the Bible \"a sort of handy guide\" on morality.[348] He viewed Britain as a \"Christian country\" and aimed to put faith back into politics.[349]\n</body></html>"
