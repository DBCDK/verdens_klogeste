                "text": "no title\n\nStephanie McMahon Levesque[8][9] (born Stephanie Marie McMahon; September 24, 1976),[5][unreliable source?] is an American businesswoman and professional wrestling personality. She is the chief brand officer (CBO) of WWE and appears as an on-screen authority figure and occasional wrestler on both the Raw and SmackDown brands. A fourth generation wrestling promoter as a member of the McMahon family, she has worked for WWE since she was a young girl (modeling T-shirts and other merchandise for various WWE catalogs) working her way up to receptionist, then in various front office jobs up to and including her current CBO position. She is the great-granddaughter of Roderick \"Jess\" McMahon, granddaughter of Vincent J. McMahon, daughter of WWE Chairman and CEO Vincent K. McMahon and retired WWE CEO and former Administrator of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, the younger sister of WWE part-owner/wrestler Shane McMahon, and wife of WWE executive/wrestler Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque. McMahon began appearing regularly on-air for WWE (then WWF as the World Wrestling Federation) in 1999 as a part of a storyline with The Undertaker. After a brief on-screen relationship with Test, she was engaged to Triple H\u2014whom she married both on-screen and later in real life\u2014which resulted in The McMahon-Helmsley Faction storyline. She has held the WWF Women's Championship once. In 2001, she was the on-screen owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling during The Invasion. The following year, she was the SmackDown General Manager, but stopped appearing regularly on television after an \"I Quit\" match with her father Vince McMahon. After making only sporadic appearances for several years, McMahon began appearing regularly on Raw in 2008 as the Raw brand general manager before disappearing once again. By mid-2013, McMahon returned to regular on-air appearances in the WWE, this time under the gimmick of an unctuous, judgmental, bullying owner along with on-screen chief operating officer, her husband, Triple H. From 2013 to 2016, they acted as a power couple known as The Authority, making what were often shady decrees while claiming only to be concerned for \"what's best for business,\" all the while romanticizing each other in the process with public displays of affection. The Authority would later expand into a stable, with its co-leaders being Triple H and herself. Stephanie Marie McMahon was born on September 24, 1976 in Hartford, Connecticut to Linda and Vince McMahon.[10] She has one brother, Shane McMahon. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. There, she attended the selective Greenwich Country Day School, throughout her elementary school years. At the age of 13, McMahon appeared in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) merchandise catalogs, modeling T-shirts and hats.[11] After graduating from Greenwich High School in 1994, she attended Boston University and in 1998 earned a degree in Communications.[12] After graduating in 1998, she began working for the WWF full-time.[13] McMahon entered the World Wrestling Federation (WWF/E) as a model and for the WWF's sales and merchandise department, but started her WWF business career as an Account Executive for the WWF offices in New York.[8][14] In her early years with the company, she did reception work, creative design, television production, and acted as a ring performer.[15] After spending time as the director of creative writing, a job she had by 2002,[15] she was promoted to Senior Vice President of Creative Writing in 2006. McMahon was promoted to executive vice president of Creative in 2007. She was responsible for overseeing the creative process (storylines) for all television and pay-per-view programming. She oversaw all aspects of talent management and branding, live event booking and marketing, and all social and digital media properties.[8] As Executive vice-president of Creative, McMahon was able to spearhead the upbringing of the WWE app, which has been downloaded over 20 million times. She was also able to launch a huge partnership with the USO metropolitan Washington, the social media company Tout, and was able to partner with Yahoo to bring WWE content.[16] Stephanie also led WWE's Creative coalition for their Anti Bullying Campaigns. On December 4, 2013 WWE announced the promotion of McMahon to chief brand officer, where she will lead efforts to further enhance WWE's brand reputation among key constituents including advertisers, media, business partners, and investors. She will also serve as the lead ambassador of WWE and work with business units to support key growth initiatives. She will also lead WWE's targeted youth and moms marketing programs. McMahon's new position enabled her to spearhead the continued partnership with General Mills' Totino's brand. On February 5, 2014, McMahon along with CMO and CRO Michelle Wilson announced a partnership between WWE and KaBOOM! to build a playground for WWE's annual WrestleMania week in Louisiana. McMahon earned a combined salary of over $775,000 between her corporate role and as an on-screen talent in 2013. She also owns over $77 million in WWE stock.[17] On April 15, 2014 during WWE's annual Business Partners Summit, McMahon confirmed that a new WWE logo would debut the night after WWE SummerSlam, although it was already showing up on WWE products like the WWE Network and NXT. On August 5, at the Needham fireside conference, McMahon alongside with her husband Triple H, and WWE Chief strategy and financial officer George Barrios, discussed the Creative side of WWE, the WWE Network, and the difference between WWE and UFC.[18] In early 1999, at the suggestion of WWF writer Vince Russo[19] McMahon debuted as the innocent and friendly daughter of Vince McMahon during an on-screen storyline involving Vince and The Undertaker.[20] The Undertaker stalked and abducted McMahon at the end of the April Backlash pay-per-view, which culminated in him almost marrying her in the middle of the ring the next night on Raw, before being rescued by Stone Cold Steve Austin.[21] McMahon then began an on-screen relationship with wrestler Test, which led to a rivalry between him and her older brother Shane.[22] After Test defeated Shane at SummerSlam in a \"Love Her Or Leave Her Match\",[23] McMahon and Test went on to team together in a match on September 20, 1999, with the couple defeating Jeff Jarrett and Debra.[24] The couple were eventually engaged, but during the in-ring ceremony, Triple H showed a video which revealed that he had drugged McMahon and taken her to Las Vegas, Nevada where they were married in a drive-through ceremony.[25][26] McMahon seemed to abhor Triple H at first, but at the inaugural Armageddon event, after Triple H defeated her father in a No Holds Barred Match, left with him after embracing. McMahon confronted Vince the next night on Raw and revealed the wedding was a planned event, which was a revenge plot against her father for the aforementioned kidnappings, thus turning her into a villainess.[26][27] In late 1999, with Vince McMahon absent as a result of injuries inflicted upon him by Triple H at the Armageddon pay-per-view, Triple H and McMahon became the on-screen owners of the WWF, a period known as the \"McMahon-Helmsley Era\" (slightly different from the modern era of \"The Authority\") and dominated by the McMahon-Helmsley Faction.[28] Triple H held the WWF Championship and McMahon held the WWF Women's Championship after defeating champion Jacqueline with the help of Tori and D-Generation X on the March 28 episode of SmackDown![29] McMahon successfully defended her title against Lita on SmackDown on June 6 and June 16.[30] McMahon reconciled with her father and brother at WrestleMania 2000 when they helped Triple H defend his title against The Rock, leaving Linda McMahon as the only fan-favorite in the McMahon family.[31] In mid-2000, a love triangle storyline began featuring McMahon, Triple H and Kurt Angle.[32] The storyline continued at Unforgiven when Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree following a low blow from McMahon, proving her loyalty to him.[33] McMahon later became Angle's manager and was in his corner when he defeated The Rock for the WWF Championship at No Mercy.[34] The alliance was short-lived, however, as after The Rock performed his Rock Bottom maneuver on McMahon at No Mercy, Triple H attacked Angle, considering it his fault that McMahon was hurt due to her managing Angle at the time.[35] On the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw, McMahon lost the WWF's Women's Championship to Lita despite the interferences from Angle and Triple H after special referee, The Rock, performed a spinebuster on McMahon.[36] The internal disputes between the McMahons led to Linda McMahon being in a comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who took the opportunity to have a public affair with Trish Stratus.[37][38] McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out.[39] Over the next few weeks, Vince made it clear that he favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus.[38] At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight.[38] During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.[37][38] McMahon later revealed that she had purchased Extreme Championship Wrestling and intended to bankrupt the WWF (in reality, the ownership of ECW assets at this time was highly disputed), along with her brother Shane, who had become the on-screen owner of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the two rosters merged to form a \"supergroup\" known as The Alliance.[22][40] Her team The Alliance consisting of her brother Shane, former WCW Champion Booker T., Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle and Steve Austin were defeated by Team WWF consisting of The Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Chris Jericho and The Rock at Survivor Series in a five-on-five, Winner Takes All elimination match.[41] The night after The Alliance was defeated, Shane and Stephanie were banished from WWF television.[42] McMahon returned in January 2002 when Triple H made a comeback as a fan-favorite, but the good couple began having problems, as McMahon began acting like a nagging and clingy wife.[26] As part of the storyline, the couple \"divorced\" after McMahon claimed to be pregnant in order to trick Triple H into renewing their marital vows.[43] Triple H later discovered that she was lying though and left her at the altar during the renewal ceremony.[44] As a result, after Triple H won the Royal Rumble, McMahon appointed herself as the special guest referee in a match between Kurt Angle and Triple H at No Way Out with Triple H's WrestleMania Undisputed WWF Championship shot on the line.[44] Though Angle won thanks to McMahon's biased officiating,[45] Triple H defeated him the next night to regain his title shot.[46] McMahon then aligned herself with former enemy, Chris Jericho.[22][46] Despite interference by McMahon, Jericho lost to Triple H at WrestleMania X8 on March 17.[47] On the March 25 episode of Raw, Jericho and McMahon lost to Triple H in a triple threat match for the Undisputed Championship, with the stipulation that, if McMahon was pinned, she would be forced to leave the WWF. In the match, McMahon came within a one count of becoming the first female WWE Champion in a pin on Jericho, but was ultimately pinned by Triple H.[48] On July 18, 2002, McMahon returned to the WWE (formerly WWF until a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund) as the general manager of SmackDown.[49] In contrast to her McMahon-Helmsley era villain character, McMahon became a fan favorite, as she began to favor fan favorite wrestlers at that time. She feuded with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown! at a Halloween party, McMahon and Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father underneath a mask.[50] McMahon was given credit for the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship.[51] She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to SmackDown!, which caused friction between herself and her father.[52] In the summer of 2003, Vince McMahon began to resent Stephanie's attempts to stop him from pursuing an affair with Sable.[53] In a controversial segment of SmackDown, John Cena requested that Stephanie rip Sable's top off and that he be allowed to slap Stephanie's buttocks; she agreed to it and he slapped her buttocks, after which she went backstage, fought Sable, and ripped Sable's top off briefly exposing Sable's breasts on air. The feud culminated in the controversial first ever \"Father\u2013Daughter 'I Quit' match\" at No Mercy.[54][55] McMahon was accompanied by her mother, the CEO of WWE Linda McMahon, and Sable accompanied Vince in their match.[54] McMahon lost when Linda, at ringside threw in a towel on her behalf because Vince would not release a choke he had on her with a lead pipe.[54] As a result of losing the match, McMahon disappeared from WWE television for two years. The match was made to write Stephanie out of storylines as she was marrying Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque that week.[56] McMahon returned as a villain once again on October 3, 2005 for Raw Homecoming, where she confronted Stone Cold Steve Austin and received a Stunner.[57] On October 10, 2005, she, along with her father and, in a surprise twist, her mother fired Raw announcer Jim Ross.[58] A visibly pregnant McMahon also returned on the March 6, 2006 episode of Raw, approaching Shawn Michaels backstage and claiming to have abdominal pains.[59] When Michaels left to get her some water, McMahon pulled out an unmarked substance out of her brassiere and poured it into his bottle of water.[59] This substance caused him to become groggy during his match against Shane later in the night, which he lost as a result.[59] McMahon also appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 1, 2006 and in a backstage vignette with her immediate family at WrestleMania 22.[60] McMahon returned during a backstage segment in April 2007 at WrestleMania 23, visiting her father before his \"Battle of the Billionaires\" match.[61] After her father returned to Raw after faking his own death,[62] McMahon publicly revealed that her father had an illegitimate child, who was among the WWE roster.[63] On the taped edition of Raw that aired September 3, 2007, McMahon, along with her mother Linda and her brother Shane, made several appearances to confront Mr. McMahon about the child, who was later revealed to be Hornswoggle, turning into a fan favorite.[64] On Raw's 15 Year Anniversary episode, she appeared along with Shane in a segment\u2014also involving her husband Triple H and Hornswoggle\u2014which ended with her kissing her real life husband Triple H, to humiliate her father on Raw.[65] After the severe injuries sustained by Vince on the June 23, three-hour edition of Raw, Shane appeared requesting for the Raw Superstars to stand together during what was a 'turbulent time'.[66][67] Shane's plea was ignored, and subsequently, for the next two weeks, McMahon and Shane urged the superstars to show solidarity.[68][69] The following week, Shane announced Mike Adamle as their choice to be the new Raw General Manager.[70] After Adamle stepped down as General Manager, McMahon soon became in charge of the brand and (reignited her feud) and had altercations with Chris Jericho in the following weeks, which involved her firing him (although he was later reinstated).[71] After her father Vince returned, the family began a feud with Randy Orton, who began the storyline by punting Vince in the head.[72] After a few weeks of feuding, Orton and his alliance, The Legacy, punted Shane in the head and performed an RKO on McMahon.[73] Following the attack, he was chased out of the ring by Triple H, her real-life husband.[73] The rivalry among Orton, the Legacy and the McMahons heated up when Orton attacked and kissed Stephanie. Triple H and the Legacy's rivalry continued at WrestleMania XXV, where Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Orton.[74] The following month, Orton won the championship at Backlash.[75] After Backlash, McMahon left Raw and took a hiatus from WWE television. McMahon appeared on the November 1 episode of Raw in a pre-taped segment, where she dreamt that Vince awoke from a coma after his doctor, played by actor and one-time WWE employee Freddie Prinze Jr., informed him that his wife Linda had invested millions in her campaign as she runs for senate.[5] Vince's heart rate elevated more and more as Prinze informed him on what was \"wrong\" with WWE since he went into a coma.[5] After beginning to feel better, Vince realizes that he has a serious case of \"the runs\", in which he gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom, in which he is covered in campaign signs, that block his backside.[5] McMahon suddenly wakes up from her dream and asks her husband, Triple H (off-screen and voice work only), if Vince was still in a coma, in which Triple H replies \"Yeah, he's in a coma. I'm pretty sure he's brain dead.\"; McMahon responds by saying \"Thank God,\" and then lays back down. McMahon made an appearance as a guest speaker at the WrestleMania XXVII Press Conference.[5] Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match.[5] Upon offering to shake his hand, Punk declined and insulted her: \"I would, but... I know where that hand's been.\"[5] The following night on Raw, McMahon appeared backstage with CM Punk and threatened him: \"...in the end, people always get what they deserve.\"[5] On July 23, 2012, McMahon made an appearance on the 1000th episode of Raw where she confronted and then slapped Paul Heyman to convince him to accept a match between Brock Lesnar and Triple H at SummerSlam.[5] On April 6, 2013, McMahon inducted former on-screen rival Trish Stratus into the WWE Hall of Fame.[76] On June 3, 2013, McMahon made an appearance to reveal her decision not to allow Triple H to compete that night.[77] On the June 17 episode of Raw, McMahon confronted new Divas Champion AJ Lee.[78] On the July 8 episode of Raw, McMahon fired Vickie Guerrero from the position of Raw Managing Supervisor when the WWE Universe voted \"Failed\" during Guerrero's job evaluation.[79] On the August 19 episode of Raw, McMahon turned heel when she interrupted Daniel Bryan and supported the actions of her husband at SummerSlam the previous night, telling Bryan that he wasn't suitable to be the face of the company. Later in the night McMahon stood beside Triple H and her father as they celebrated Randy Orton's WWE Championship Coronation, during which Daniel Bryan was attacked by The Shield and subsequently by Orton. In November 2013, McMahon signed a three-year performer's contract with the WWE, confirming her as a regular on its programming.[80] She and Triple H continued to rule the company as a controlling \"power couple\" dubbed The Authority. Swearing that their actions were \"best for business\", the pair would belittle and punish any talent that went against their ideology, and formed a particular vendetta against Daniel Bryan. McMahon was at ringside when Triple H lost to Bryan at WrestleMania XXX. In June 2014, as part of the ongoing storyline with Bryan, McMahon threatened to fire his wife Brie Bella if Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which forced Brie to quit before slapping McMahon in the face.[81] On the June 16 episode of Raw, Roman Reigns spiked the coffee Vickie Guerrero gave to McMahon, causing Stephanie to throw up on Vickie and leave with Triple H to the hospital. Vickie later gave Reigns a chance in the battle royal, which he would win.[82] On the June 23 episode of Raw, Vickie lost in a pudding match against McMahon with her job on the line, after interference by Alicia Fox, Layla and Rosa Mendes. Vickie ultimately lost the match and was fired; however, she got her retribution over McMahon by throwing her into the mud pool.[83] After Brie quit, McMahon put Brie's sister Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment.[84][85][86][87] Brie returned to television on the July 21 episode of Raw, appearing in the crowd leading to a confrontation between the two. McMahon was (kayfabe) arrested and charged with assault and battery, because she slapped Brie, who was not a (kayfabe) WWE employee[88] The following week, McMahon granted Brie her job back and a match at SummerSlam against her in order to get Brie to drop the lawsuit.[89] On the August 4 episode of Raw, after their contract signing, McMahon pedigreed both twins.[90] At SummerSlam, Nikki turned on Brie, allowing Stephanie to hit a pedigree on Brie having Stephanie win her first pay per view match in over 10 years.[91] On the October 27 episode of Raw, after John Cena, the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join the Authority, Triple H announced a Traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing the Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, the Authority will be ousted from power. During the match, Triple H tried to get the last member of Team Cena, Dolph Ziggler, eliminated by attacking two referees and placing Seth Rollins (who was also the final member of Team Authority) on top of Ziggler and calling crooked referee Scott Armstrong into the ring to make the count; however, the debuting Sting came out and attacked Armstrong and Triple H, giving Team Cena the win and thus disbanding The Authority. Stephanie and Triple H appeared on the episode of Raw after Survivor Series stating that without them the company would be driven to the ground. They were then escorted out of the arena by the returning Daniel Bryan and only to be insulted by Mr.McMahon for letting him down and the McMahon family before exiting the arena. On the December 29 episode of Raw, The Authority was brought back in power by John Cena, and she and her husband entered and stepped on the entrance ramp celebrating their return with a glass of champagne and a kiss.[92] Stephanie and Triple H then proceeded to fire Erick Rowan, Ryback and Dolph Ziggler. On the July 13, 2015 episode of Raw, Stephanie interrupted Team Bella (The Bella Twins and Alicia Fox) to introduce Becky Lynch, Charlotte, and then-NXT Women's Champion Sasha Banks, calling for a \"revolution\" in the WWE Divas division. While Lynch and Charlotte allied with Paige, Banks would ally with Tamina and Naomi, leading to a brawl between the three teams.[93] On the February 22, 2016 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon presented the \"Vincent J. McMahon Legacy of Excellence\" award to Stephanie. Before she could start her acceptance speech, Shane McMahon returned for the first time since 2009 and demanded to gain control of Raw, claiming The Authority was running the company to the ground. Mr. McMahon accepted the offer, only if he won one more match. Shane accepted, and Mr. McMahon announced he would wrestle at WrestleMania 32 against The Undertaker inside Hell in a Cell. On the post-WrestleMania episode of Raw on April 4, Mr. McMahon opened the show to announce that his returning son, Shane, would run Raw for one night only. However, Shane continued to run Raw due to \"overwhelming fan support\" until the April 25 episode of Raw, when Stephanie returned to announce that Mr. McMahon would decide who'd permanently control Raw at Payback. Mr. McMahon announced that both Stephanie and Shane would run Raw together on a permanent basis, thus disbanding The Authority. On the July 11 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon announced Stephanie as the commissioner of the Raw brand, while Shane was named commissioner of SmackDown in order for them to compete against each other in the upcoming reestablished brand extension. The following week on Raw, Stephanie appointed Mick Foley as the Raw General Manager. The next week on Raw, Stephanie and Mick Foley announced the WWE Universal Championship would be the main championship on Raw. On the October 11 episode of SmackDown, Commissioner Shane McMahon and General Manager Daniel Bryan challenged Raw to three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches \u2013 involving each brand's best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively. The following week on Raw, Raw Commissioner Stephanie accepted the challenge. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Stephanie invited both Shane and Bryan to appear on the following week's Raw to address the interpromotional matches, which Shane and Bryan accepted. During this meeting, each commissioner and general manager touted the reasons for why their respective brand was better and eventually called out their respective male teams. In the ensuing battle, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins of Team Raw stood tall at the end. At Survivor Series, Team SmackDown defeated Team Raw, On the March 20 episode of Raw, Foley was fired as Raw General Manager for his actions. In April, Stephanie was written out of the storyline after being pushed accidentally through a table at WrestleMania 33 by Triple H, and did not appear on WWE TV for many months. However, McMahon made a one-off appearance after Kevin Owens assaulted her father on the September 12 edition of SmackDown.[94] McMahon returned to Raw on the October 30, 2017 episode, confronting Raw General Manager Kurt Angle regarding Shane and the Smackdown roster's attack on the Raw roster at the end of the previous week's Raw, naming him team captain for Raw at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, warning him that if Raw is not victorious over Smackdown at the pay-per-view, she was considering dismissing him from being Raw General Manager. On the December 18 episode of Raw, after a six-woman tag team match between the team of Sasha Banks, Bayley, and Mickie James and Absolution (Paige, Mandy Rose, and Sonya Deville) ended in disqualification and a brawl ensued with the rest of the Raw women's roster (Alicia Fox, Asuka, Nia Jax, Dana Brooke, and Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss), Raw Commissioner Stephanie came out and the brawl stopped. Stephanie recapped the leaps that women's wrestling had taken the past few years, going from a revolution to an evolution of women's wrestling, including the first-ever women's Hell in a Cell match, the first-ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match, and women main eventing Raw and SmackDown. She then announced the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match for the 2018 Royal Rumble with the winner receiving a match at WrestleMania 34 for either the Raw Women's Championship or SmackDown Women's Championship. Upon the signing of Ronda Rousey, McMahon embarked on a feud with her, leading to mixed tag-team match at WrestleMania 34 against Rousey and Kurt Angle with her husband, Triple H as her partner. This was McMahon's first match since SummerSlam (2014) and her first ever WrestleMania match. At the event, her team was defeated when she tapped out to Rousey's armbar.[95] Following this loss, Stephanie would begin making only sporadic appearances on TV. On the July 23 episode of Raw, McMahon returned to announce a match between Kevin Owens and Braun Strowman at the August 19 SummerSlam Pay Per View. The match was created with a stipulation that if Strowman loses the match in any way, he loses his Money in the Bank contract to Owens. On that same episode, McMahon also announced the upcoming all women Evolution Pay Per View. On the September 24 edition of Raw, Stephanie returned as a face for the first time since 2013 when she told Baron Corbin about the lack of leadership he had been doing and if he doesn't improve that she would bring back Kurt Angle from vacation. She also returned on the 1000th Episode of SmackDown on Truth TV. On the November 12 episode of Raw, Stephanie returned to rally Team Raw at the Survivor Series and confronted Braun Strowman to make business proposition that if Team Raw is victorious, she promised him to have a match with Baron Corbin and a Universal Championship rematch against Brock Lesnar.

She is the chief brand officer (CBO) of WWE and appears as an on-screen authority figure and occasional wrestler on both the Raw and SmackDown brands.\nA fourth generation wrestling promoter as a member of the McMahon family, she has worked for WWE since she was a young girl (modeling T-shirts and other merchandise for various WWE catalogs) working her way up to receptionist, then in various front office jobs up to and including her current CBO position. She is the great-granddaughter of Roderick \"Jess\" McMahon, granddaughter of Vincent J. McMahon, daughter of WWE Chairman and CEO Vincent K. McMahon and retired WWE CEO and former Administrator of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, the younger sister of WWE part-owner/wrestler Shane McMahon, and wife of WWE executive/wrestler Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque.\nMcMahon began appearing regularly on-air for WWE (then WWF as the World Wrestling Federation) in 1999 as a part of a storyline with The Undertaker. After a brief on-screen relationship with Test, she was engaged to Triple H\u2014whom she married both on-screen and later in real life\u2014which resulted in The McMahon-Helmsley Faction storyline. She has held the WWF Women's Championship once. In 2001, she was the on-screen owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling during The Invasion. The following year, she was the SmackDown General Manager, but stopped appearing regularly on television after an \"I Quit\" match with her father Vince McMahon.\nAfter making only sporadic appearances for several years, McMahon began appearing regularly on Raw in 2008 as the Raw brand general manager before disappearing once again. By mid-2013, McMahon returned to regular on-air appearances in the WWE, this time under the gimmick of an unctuous, judgmental, bullying owner along with on-screen chief operating officer, her husband, Triple H. From 2013 to 2016, they acted as a power couple known as The Authority, making what were often shady decrees while claiming only to be concerned for \"what's best for business,\" all the while romanticizing each other in the process with public displays of affection. The Authority would later expand into a stable, with its co-leaders being Triple H and herself.\nStephanie Marie McMahon was born on September 24, 1976 in Hartford, Connecticut to Linda and Vince McMahon.[10] She has one brother, Shane McMahon. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. There, she attended the selective Greenwich Country Day School, throughout her elementary school years. At the age of 13, McMahon appeared in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) merchandise catalogs, modeling T-shirts and hats.[11] After graduating from Greenwich High School in 1994, she attended Boston University and in 1998 earned a degree in Communications.[12] After graduating in 1998, she began working for the WWF full-time.[13]\nMcMahon entered the World Wrestling Federation (WWF/E) as a model and  for the WWF's sales and merchandise department, but started her WWF business career as an Account Executive for the WWF offices in New York.[8][14] In her early years with the company, she did reception work, creative design, television production, and acted as a ring performer.[15] After spending time as the director of creative writing, a job she had by 2002,[15] she was promoted to Senior Vice President of Creative Writing in 2006.\nMcMahon was promoted to executive vice president of Creative in 2007. She was responsible for overseeing the creative process (storylines) for all television and pay-per-view programming. She oversaw all aspects of talent management and branding, live event booking and marketing, and all social and digital media properties.[8]\nAs Executive vice-president of Creative, McMahon was able to spearhead the upbringing of the WWE app, which has been downloaded over 20 million times. She was also able to launch a huge partnership with the USO metropolitan Washington, the social media company Tout, and was able to partner with Yahoo to bring WWE content.[16] Stephanie also led WWE's Creative coalition for their Anti Bullying Campaigns.\nOn December 4, 2013 WWE announced the promotion of McMahon to chief brand officer, where she will lead efforts to further enhance WWE's brand reputation among key constituents including advertisers, media, business partners, and investors. She will also serve as the lead ambassador of WWE and work with business units to support key growth initiatives. She will also lead WWE's targeted youth and moms marketing programs.\nMcMahon's new position enabled her to spearhead the continued partnership with General Mills' Totino's brand.\nOn February 5, 2014, McMahon along with CMO and CRO Michelle Wilson announced a partnership between WWE and KaBOOM! to build a playground for WWE's annual WrestleMania week in Louisiana. McMahon earned a combined salary of over $775,000 between her corporate role and as an on-screen talent in 2013. She also owns over $77 million in WWE stock.[17]\nOn April 15, 2014 during WWE's annual Business Partners Summit, McMahon confirmed that a new WWE logo would debut the night after WWE SummerSlam, although it was already showing up on WWE products like the WWE Network and NXT.\nOn August 5, at the Needham fireside conference, McMahon alongside with her husband Triple H, and WWE Chief strategy and financial officer George Barrios, discussed the Creative side of WWE, the WWE Network, and the difference between WWE and UFC.[18]\nIn early 1999, at the suggestion of WWF writer Vince Russo[19] McMahon debuted as the innocent and friendly daughter of Vince McMahon during an on-screen storyline involving Vince and The Undertaker.[20] The Undertaker stalked and abducted McMahon at the end of the April Backlash pay-per-view, which culminated in him almost marrying her in the middle of the ring the next night on Raw, before being rescued by Stone Cold Steve Austin.[21]\nMcMahon then began an on-screen relationship with wrestler Test, which led to a rivalry between him and her older brother Shane.[22] After Test defeated Shane at SummerSlam in a \"Love Her Or Leave Her Match\",[23] McMahon and Test went on to team together in a match on September 20, 1999, with the couple defeating Jeff Jarrett and Debra.[24] The couple were eventually engaged, but during the in-ring ceremony, Triple H showed a video which revealed that he had drugged McMahon and taken her to Las Vegas, Nevada where they were married in a drive-through ceremony.[25][26] McMahon seemed to abhor Triple H at first, but at the inaugural Armageddon event, after Triple H defeated her father in a No Holds Barred Match, left with him after embracing. McMahon confronted Vince the next night on Raw and revealed the wedding was a planned event, which was a revenge plot against her father for the aforementioned kidnappings, thus turning her into a villainess.[26][27]\nIn late 1999, with Vince McMahon absent as a result of injuries inflicted upon him by Triple H at the Armageddon pay-per-view, Triple H and McMahon became the on-screen owners of the WWF, a period known as the \"McMahon-Helmsley Era\" (slightly different from the modern era of \"The Authority\") and dominated by the McMahon-Helmsley Faction.[28] Triple H held the WWF Championship and McMahon held the WWF Women's Championship after defeating champion Jacqueline with the help of Tori and D-Generation X on the March 28 episode of SmackDown![29] McMahon successfully defended her title against Lita on SmackDown on June 6 and June 16.[30] McMahon reconciled with her father and brother at WrestleMania 2000 when they helped Triple H defend his title against The Rock, leaving Linda McMahon as the only fan-favorite in the McMahon family.[31]\nIn mid-2000, a love triangle storyline began featuring McMahon, Triple H and Kurt Angle.[32] The storyline continued at Unforgiven when Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree following a low blow from McMahon, proving her loyalty to him.[33] McMahon later became Angle's manager and was in his corner when he defeated The Rock for the WWF Championship at No Mercy.[34] The alliance was short-lived, however, as after The Rock performed his Rock Bottom maneuver on McMahon at No Mercy, Triple H attacked Angle, considering it his fault that McMahon was hurt due to her managing Angle at the time.[35] On the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw, McMahon lost the WWF's Women's Championship to Lita despite the interferences from Angle and Triple H after special referee, The Rock, performed a spinebuster on McMahon.[36]\nThe internal disputes between the McMahons led to Linda McMahon being in a comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who took the opportunity to have a public affair with Trish Stratus.[37][38] McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out.[39] Over the next few weeks, Vince made it clear that he favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus.[38] At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight.[38] During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.[37][38]\nMcMahon later revealed that she had purchased Extreme Championship Wrestling and intended to bankrupt the WWF (in reality, the ownership of ECW assets at this time was highly disputed), along with her brother Shane, who had become the on-screen owner of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the two rosters merged to form a \"supergroup\" known as The Alliance.[22][40]\nHer team The Alliance consisting of her brother Shane, former WCW Champion Booker T., Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle and Steve Austin were defeated by Team WWF consisting of The Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Chris Jericho and The Rock at Survivor Series in a five-on-five, Winner Takes All elimination match.[41] The night after The Alliance was defeated, Shane and Stephanie were banished from WWF television.[42] McMahon returned in January 2002 when Triple H made a comeback as a fan-favorite, but the good couple began having problems, as McMahon began acting like a nagging and clingy wife.[26]\nAs part of the storyline, the couple \"divorced\" after McMahon claimed to be pregnant in order to trick Triple H into renewing their marital vows.[43] Triple H later discovered that she was lying though and left her at the altar during the renewal ceremony.[44] As a result, after Triple H won the Royal Rumble, McMahon appointed herself as the special guest referee in a match between Kurt Angle and Triple H at No Way Out with Triple H's WrestleMania Undisputed WWF Championship shot on the line.[44] Though Angle won thanks to McMahon's biased officiating,[45] Triple H defeated him the next night to regain his title shot.[46] McMahon then aligned herself with former enemy, Chris Jericho.[22][46] Despite interference by McMahon, Jericho lost to Triple H at WrestleMania X8 on March 17.[47] On the March 25 episode of Raw, Jericho and McMahon lost to Triple H in a triple threat match for the Undisputed Championship, with the stipulation that, if McMahon was pinned, she would be forced to leave the WWF. In the match, McMahon came within a one count of becoming the first female WWE Champion in a pin on Jericho, but was ultimately pinned by Triple H.[48]\nOn July 18, 2002, McMahon returned to the WWE (formerly WWF until a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund) as the general manager of SmackDown.[49] In contrast to her McMahon-Helmsley era villain character, McMahon became a fan favorite, as she began to favor fan favorite wrestlers at that time. She feuded with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown! at a Halloween party, McMahon and Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father underneath a mask.[50] McMahon was given credit for the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship.[51] She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to SmackDown!, which caused friction between herself and her father.[52]\nIn the summer of 2003, Vince McMahon began to resent Stephanie's attempts to stop him from pursuing an affair with Sable.[53] In a controversial segment of SmackDown, John Cena requested that Stephanie rip Sable's top off and that he be allowed to slap Stephanie's buttocks; she agreed to it and he slapped her buttocks, after which she went backstage, fought Sable, and ripped Sable's top off briefly exposing Sable's breasts on air. The feud culminated in the controversial first ever \"Father\u2013Daughter 'I Quit' match\" at No Mercy.[54][55] McMahon was accompanied by her mother, the CEO of WWE Linda McMahon, and Sable accompanied Vince in their match.[54] McMahon lost when Linda, at ringside threw in a towel on her behalf because Vince would not release a choke he had on her with a lead pipe.[54] As a result of losing the match, McMahon disappeared from WWE television for two years. The match was made to write Stephanie out of storylines as she was marrying Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque that week.[56]\nMcMahon returned as a villain once again on October 3, 2005 for Raw Homecoming, where she confronted Stone Cold Steve Austin and received a Stunner.[57] On October 10, 2005, she, along with her father and, in a surprise twist, her mother fired Raw announcer Jim Ross.[58]\nA visibly pregnant McMahon also returned on the March 6, 2006 episode of Raw, approaching Shawn Michaels backstage and claiming to have abdominal pains.[59] When Michaels left to get her some water, McMahon pulled out an unmarked substance out of her brassiere and poured it into his bottle of water.[59] This substance caused him to become groggy during his match against Shane later in the night, which he lost as a result.[59] McMahon also appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 1, 2006 and in a backstage vignette with her immediate family at WrestleMania 22.[60]\nMcMahon returned during a backstage segment in April 2007 at WrestleMania 23, visiting her father before his \"Battle of the Billionaires\" match.[61] After her father returned to Raw after faking his own death,[62] McMahon publicly revealed that her father had an illegitimate child, who was among the WWE roster.[63] On the taped edition of Raw that aired September 3, 2007, McMahon, along with her mother Linda and her brother Shane, made several appearances to confront Mr. McMahon about the child, who was later revealed to be Hornswoggle, turning into a fan favorite.[64] On Raw's 15 Year Anniversary episode, she appeared along with Shane in a segment\u2014also involving her husband Triple H and Hornswoggle\u2014which ended with her kissing her real life husband Triple H, to humiliate her father on Raw.[65]\nAfter the severe injuries sustained by Vince on the June 23, three-hour edition of Raw, Shane appeared requesting for the Raw Superstars to stand together during what was a 'turbulent time'.[66][67] Shane's plea was ignored, and subsequently, for the next two weeks, McMahon and Shane urged the superstars to show solidarity.[68][69] The following week, Shane announced Mike Adamle as their choice to be the new Raw General Manager.[70]\nAfter Adamle stepped down as General Manager, McMahon soon became in charge of the brand and (reignited her feud) and had altercations with Chris Jericho in the following weeks, which involved her firing him (although he was later reinstated).[71] After her father Vince returned, the family began a feud with Randy Orton, who began the storyline by punting Vince in the head.[72] After a few weeks of feuding, Orton and his alliance, The Legacy, punted Shane in the head and performed an RKO on McMahon.[73] Following the attack, he was chased out of the ring by Triple H, her real-life husband.[73] The rivalry among Orton, the Legacy and the McMahons heated up when Orton attacked and kissed Stephanie. Triple H and the Legacy's rivalry continued at WrestleMania XXV, where Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Orton.[74] The following month, Orton won the championship at Backlash.[75] After Backlash, McMahon left Raw and took a hiatus from WWE television.\nMcMahon appeared on the November 1 episode of Raw in a pre-taped segment, where she dreamt that Vince awoke from a coma after his doctor, played by actor and one-time WWE employee Freddie Prinze Jr., informed him that his wife Linda had invested millions in her campaign as she runs for senate.[5] Vince's heart rate elevated more and more as Prinze informed him on what was \"wrong\" with WWE since he went into a coma.[5] After beginning to feel better, Vince realizes that he has a serious case of \"the runs\", in which he gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom, in which he is covered in campaign signs, that block his backside.[5] McMahon suddenly wakes up from her dream and asks her husband, Triple H (off-screen and voice work only), if Vince was still in a coma, in which Triple H replies \"Yeah, he's in a coma. I'm pretty sure he's brain dead.\"; McMahon responds by saying \"Thank God,\" and then lays back down.\nMcMahon made an appearance as a guest speaker at the WrestleMania XXVII Press Conference.[5] Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match.[5] Upon offering to shake his hand, Punk declined and insulted her: \"I would, but... I know where that hand's been.\"[5] The following night on Raw, McMahon appeared backstage with CM Punk and threatened him: \"...in the end, people always get what they deserve.\"[5]\nOn July 23, 2012, McMahon made an appearance on the 1000th episode of Raw where she confronted and then slapped Paul Heyman to convince him to accept a match between Brock Lesnar and Triple H at SummerSlam.[5] On April 6, 2013, McMahon inducted former on-screen rival Trish Stratus into the WWE Hall of Fame.[76]\nOn June 3, 2013, McMahon made an appearance to reveal her decision not to allow Triple H to compete that night.[77] On the June 17 episode of Raw, McMahon confronted new Divas Champion AJ Lee.[78] On the July 8 episode of Raw, McMahon fired Vickie Guerrero from the position of Raw Managing Supervisor when the WWE Universe voted \"Failed\" during Guerrero's job evaluation.[79]\nOn the August 19 episode of Raw, McMahon turned heel when she interrupted Daniel Bryan and supported the actions of her husband at SummerSlam the previous night, telling Bryan that he wasn't suitable to be the face of the company. Later in the night McMahon stood beside Triple H and her father as they celebrated Randy Orton's WWE Championship Coronation, during which Daniel Bryan was attacked by The Shield and subsequently by Orton. In November 2013, McMahon signed a three-year performer's contract with the WWE, confirming her as a regular on its programming.[80] She and Triple H continued to rule the company as a controlling \"power couple\" dubbed The Authority. Swearing that their actions were \"best for business\", the pair would belittle and punish any talent that went against their ideology, and formed a particular vendetta against Daniel Bryan. McMahon was at ringside when Triple H lost to Bryan at WrestleMania XXX.\nIn June 2014, as part of the ongoing storyline with Bryan, McMahon threatened to fire his wife Brie Bella if Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which forced Brie to quit before slapping McMahon in the face.[81] On the June 16 episode of Raw, Roman Reigns spiked the coffee Vickie Guerrero gave to McMahon, causing Stephanie to throw up on Vickie and leave with Triple H to the hospital. Vickie later gave Reigns a chance in the battle royal, which he would win.[82] On the June 23 episode of Raw, Vickie lost in a pudding match against McMahon with her job on the line, after interference by Alicia Fox, Layla and Rosa Mendes. Vickie ultimately lost the match and was fired; however, she got her retribution over McMahon by throwing her into the mud pool.[83] After Brie quit, McMahon put Brie's sister Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment.[84][85][86][87] Brie returned to television on the July 21 episode of Raw, appearing in the crowd leading to a confrontation between the two. McMahon was (kayfabe) arrested and charged with assault and battery, because she slapped Brie, who was not a (kayfabe) WWE employee[88] The following week, McMahon granted Brie her job back and a match at SummerSlam against her in order to get Brie to drop the lawsuit.[89] On the August 4 episode of Raw, after their contract signing, McMahon pedigreed both twins.[90] At SummerSlam, Nikki turned on Brie, allowing Stephanie to hit a pedigree on Brie having Stephanie win her first pay per view match in over 10 years.[91]\nOn the October 27 episode of Raw, after John Cena, the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join the Authority, Triple H announced a Traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing the Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, the Authority will be ousted from power. During the match, Triple H tried to get the last member of Team Cena, Dolph Ziggler, eliminated by attacking two referees and placing Seth Rollins (who was also the final member of Team Authority) on top of Ziggler and calling crooked referee Scott Armstrong into the ring to make the count; however, the debuting Sting came out and attacked Armstrong and Triple H, giving Team Cena the win and thus disbanding The Authority.

McMahon Legacy of Excellence\" award to Stephanie. Before she could start her acceptance speech, Shane McMahon returned for the first time since 2009 and demanded to gain control of Raw, claiming The Authority was running the company to the ground. Mr. McMahon accepted the offer, only if he won one more match. Shane accepted, and Mr. McMahon announced he would wrestle at WrestleMania 32 against The Undertaker inside Hell in a Cell. On the post-WrestleMania episode of Raw on April 4, Mr. McMahon opened the show to announce that his returning son, Shane, would run Raw for one night only. However, Shane continued to run Raw due to \"overwhelming fan support\" until the April 25 episode of Raw, when Stephanie returned to announce that Mr. McMahon would decide who'd permanently control Raw at Payback. Mr. McMahon announced that both Stephanie and Shane would run Raw together on a permanent basis, thus disbanding The Authority.\nOn the July 11 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon announced Stephanie as the commissioner of the Raw brand, while Shane was named commissioner of SmackDown in order for them to compete against each other in the upcoming reestablished brand extension.

The following week on Raw, Raw Commissioner Stephanie accepted the challenge. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Stephanie invited both Shane and Bryan to appear on the following week's Raw to address the interpromotional matches, which Shane and Bryan accepted.

In the ensuing battle, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins of Team Raw stood tall at the end. At Survivor Series, Team SmackDown defeated Team Raw, On the March 20 episode of Raw, Foley was fired as Raw General Manager for his actions.

On the December 18 episode of Raw, after a six-woman tag team match between the team of Sasha Banks, Bayley, and Mickie James and Absolution (Paige, Mandy Rose, and Sonya Deville) ended in disqualification and a brawl ensued with the rest of the Raw women's roster (Alicia Fox, Asuka, Nia Jax, Dana Brooke, and Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss), Raw Commissioner Stephanie came out and the brawl stopped. Stephanie recapped the leaps that women's wrestling had taken the past few years, going from a revolution to an evolution of women's wrestling, including the first-ever women's Hell in a Cell match, the first-ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match, and women main eventing Raw and SmackDown. She then announced the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match for the 2018 Royal Rumble with the winner receiving a match at WrestleMania 34 for either the Raw Women's Championship or SmackDown Women's Championship.\nUpon the signing of Ronda Rousey, McMahon embarked on a feud with her, leading to mixed tag-team match at WrestleMania 34 against Rousey and Kurt Angle with her husband, Triple H as her partner. This was McMahon's first match since SummerSlam (2014) and her first ever WrestleMania match. At the event, her team was defeated when she tapped out to Rousey's armbar.[95] Following this loss, Stephanie would begin making only sporadic appearances on TV.\nOn the July 23 episode of Raw, McMahon returned to announce a match between Kevin Owens and Braun Strowman at the August 19 SummerSlam Pay Per View.

On that same episode, McMahon also announced the upcoming all women Evolution Pay Per View.

                "text": "no title\n\nJoanne Rowling CH, OBE, HonFRSE, FRCPE, FRSL (/\u02c8ro\u028al\u026a\u014b/ ROH-ling;[1] born 31 July 1965), better known by her pen name J.\u00a0K. Rowling, is a British author, film producer, television producer, screenwriter, and philanthropist. She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500\u00a0million copies,[2][3] becoming the best-selling book series in history.[4] The books are the basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts[5] and was a producer on the final films.[6] She also writes crime fiction under the name Robert Galbraith. Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.[7] The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written five books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and\u2014under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith\u2014the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series, which consists of The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015), and Lethal White (2018).[8] Rowling has lived a \"rags to riches\" life in which she progressed from living on benefits to being the world's first billionaire author.[9] She lost her billionaire status after giving away much of her earnings to charity but remains one of the wealthiest people in the world.[10] She is the UK's best-selling living author, with sales in excess of \u00a3238 million.[11] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3600\u00a0million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] Time named her a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans.[13] In October 2010, Rowling was named the \"Most Influential Woman in Britain\" by leading magazine editors.[14] She has supported multiple charities, including Comic Relief, One Parent Families, and Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain, as well as launching her own charity, Lumos. Although she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, her name, before her remarriage, was Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother.[15] She calls herself Jo.[16] Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.[17][18] During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling[19] and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.[20] Joanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965[21][22] in Yate, Gloucestershire,[23][24] the daughter of science technician Anne (n\u00e9e Volant) and Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer Peter James Rowling.[25][26] Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.[27] They married on 14 March 1965.[27] One of Rowling's maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was a Scottish man from Lamlash.[28][29] Her mother's French paternal grandfather, Louis Volant,[30] was awarded the War Cross for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during World War I. Rowling originally believed Volant had won the Legion of Honour during the war, as she said when she received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are? in which she found out it was a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard her grandfather's story of bravery and discovered that the War Cross was for \"ordinary\" soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the War Cross was \"better\" to her than the Legion of Honour.[31][32] Rowling's sister Dianne[7] was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old.[24] The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four.[33] As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories which she frequently read to her sister.[1] Aged nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales.[24] When she was a young teenager, her great-aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels.[34] Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling read all of her books.[35] Rowling has said that her teenage years were unhappy.[25] Her home life was complicated by her mother's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis[36] and a strained relationship with her father, with whom she is not on speaking terms.[25] Rowling later said that she based the character of Hermione Granger on herself when she was eleven.[37] Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.[38] Like many teenagers, she became interested in rock music, listening to the Clash,[39] the Smiths, and Siouxsie Sioux, adopting the look of the latter with back-combed hair and black eyeliner, a look that she would still sport when beginning university.[40] As a child, Rowling attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More.[41][42] Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.[43] She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother worked in the science department.[26] Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English\".[25] Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B[27] and was head girl.[25] In 1982, Rowling took the entrance exams for Oxford University but was not accepted[25] and earned a BA in French and Classics at the University of Exeter.[44][45][46] Martin Sorrell, a French professor at Exeter, remembers \"a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, gave the appearance of doing what was necessary\".[25] Rowling recalls doing little work, preferring to read Dickens and Tolkien.[25] After a year of study in Paris, Rowling graduated from Exeter in 1986.[25] In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying Classics titled \"What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled\"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[47] After working as a researcher and bilingual secretary in London for Amnesty International,[48] Rowling moved with her then boyfriend to Manchester,[24] where she worked at the Chamber of Commerce.[27] In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry \"came fully formed\" into her mind.[24][49] When she had reached her Clapham Junction flat, she began to write immediately.[24][50] In December, Rowling's mother, Anne, died after ten years suffering from multiple sclerosis.[24] Rowling was writing Harry Potter at the time and had never told her mother about it.[18] Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing,[18] and she channelled her own feelings of loss by writing about Harry's own feelings of loss in greater detail in the first book.[51] An advertisement in The Guardian[27] led Rowling to move to Porto, Portugal, to teach English as a foreign language.[7][35] She taught at night and began writing in the day while listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.[25] After 18 months in Porto, she met Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found they shared an interest in Jane Austen.[27] They married on 16 October 1992 and their child, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford), was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal.[27] Rowling had previously suffered a miscarriage.[27] The couple separated on 17 November 1993.[27][52] Biographers have suggested that Rowling suffered domestic abuse during her marriage, although the extent is unknown.[27][53] In December 1993, Rowling and her then infant daughter moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, to be near Rowling's sister[24] with three chapters of what would become Harry Potter in her suitcase.[25] Seven years after graduating from university, Rowling saw herself as a failure.[54] Her marriage had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child, but she described her failure as liberating and allowing her to focus on writing.[54] During this period, Rowling was diagnosed with clinical depression and contemplated suicide.[55] Her illness inspired the characters known as Dementors, soul-sucking creatures introduced in the third book.[56] Rowling signed up for welfare benefits, describing her economic status as being \"poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless.\"[25][54] Rowling was left in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter.[27] She obtained an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994.[27] She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University,[57] after completing her first novel while living on state benefits.[58] She wrote in many caf\u00e9s, especially Nicolson's Caf\u00e9 (owned by her brother-in-law),[59][60] and the Elephant House,[61] wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep.[24][62] In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local caf\u00e9s to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in caf\u00e9s was that taking her baby out for a walk was the best way to make her fall asleep.[62] In 1995, Rowling finished her manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which was typed on an old manual typewriter.[64] Upon the enthusiastic response of Bryony Evens, a reader who had been asked to review the book's first three chapters, the Fulham-based Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript.[27] A year later she was finally given the green light (and a \u00a31,500 advance) by editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury, a publishing house in London.[27][65] The decision to publish Rowling's book owes much to Alice Newton, the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chairman, who was given the first chapter to review by her father and immediately demanded the next.[66] Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little chance of making money in children's books.[67] Soon after, in 1997, Rowling received an \u00a38,000 grant from the Scottish Arts Council to enable her to continue writing.[68] In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued between \u00a316,000 and \u00a325,000.[69] Five months later, the book won its first award, a Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize. In February, the novel won the British Book Award for Children's Book of the Year, and later, the Children's Book Award. In early 1998, an auction was held in the United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by Scholastic Inc., for US$105,000. Rowling said that she \"nearly died\" when she heard the news.[70] In October 1998, Scholastic published Philosopher's Stone in the US under the title of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a change Rowling says she now regrets and would have fought if she had been in a better position at the time.[71] Rowling moved from her flat with the money from the Scholastic sale, into 19 Hazelbank Terrace in Edinburgh.[59] Its sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in July 1998 and again Rowling won the Smarties Prize.[72] In December 1999, the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, won the Smarties Prize, making Rowling the first person to win the award three times running.[73] She later withdrew the fourth Harry Potter novel from contention to allow other books a fair chance. In January 2000, Prisoner of Azkaban won the inaugural Whitbread Children's Book of the Year award, though it lost the Book of the Year prize to Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.[74] The fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was released simultaneously in the UK and the US on 8 July 2000 and broke sales records in both countries. 372,775 copies of the book were sold in its first day in the UK, almost equalling the number Prisoner of Azkaban sold during its first year.[75] In the US, the book sold three million copies in its first 48 hours, smashing all records.[75] Rowling said that she had had a crisis while writing the novel and had to rewrite one chapter many times to fix a problem with the plot.[76] Rowling was named Author of the Year in the 2000 British Book Awards.[77] A wait of three years occurred between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied.[78] Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, that it could have been shorter, and that she ran out of time and energy as she tried to finish it.[79] The sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 16 July 2005. It too broke all sales records, selling nine million copies in its first 24 hours of release.[80] In 2006, Half-Blood Prince received the Book of the Year prize at the British Book Awards.[72] The title of the seventh and final Harry Potter book was announced on 21 December 2006 as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[81] In February 2007 it was reported that Rowling wrote on a bust in her hotel room at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh that she had finished the seventh book in that room on 11 January 2007.[82] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:01 BST)[83] and broke its predecessor's record as the fastest-selling book of all time.[84] It sold 11\u00a0million copies in the first day of release in the United Kingdom and United States.[84] The book's last chapter was one of the earliest things she wrote in the entire series.[85] Harry Potter is now a global brand worth an estimated US$15\u00a0billion,[86] and the last four Harry Potter books have consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.[84][87] The series, totalling 4,195 pages,[88] has been translated, in whole or in part, into 65 languages.[89] The Harry Potter books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when children were thought to be abandoning books for computers and television,[90] although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.[91] In October 1998, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the first two novels for a seven-figure sum.[92] A film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released on 16 November 2001, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on 15 November 2002.[93] Both films were directed by Chris Columbus. The film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released on 4 June 2004, directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. The fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was directed by Mike Newell, and released on 18 November 2005. The film of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released on 11 July 2007.[93] David Yates directed, and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay, having taken over the position from Steve Kloves. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released on 15 July 2009.[94] David Yates directed again, and Kloves returned to write the script.[95] Warner Bros. filmed the final instalment of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in two segments, with part one being released on 19 November 2010 and part two being released on 15 July 2011. Yates directed both films.[96][97] Warner Bros. took considerable notice of Rowling's desires when drafting her contract. One of her principal stipulations was the films be shot in Britain with an all-British cast,[98] which has been generally adhered to. Rowling also demanded that Coca-Cola, the winner in the race to tie in their products to the film series, donate US$18\u00a0million to the American charity Reading Is Fundamental, as well as several community charity programs.[99] Steve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film; Rowling assisted him in the writing process, ensuring that his scripts did not contradict future books in the series.[100] She told Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) certain secrets about their characters before they were revealed in the books.[101] Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) asked her if Harry died at any point in the series; Rowling answered him by saying, \"You have a death scene\", thereby not explicitly answering the question.[102] Director Steven Spielberg was approached to direct the first film, but dropped out. The press has repeatedly claimed that Rowling played a role in his departure, but Rowling stated that she had no say in who directed the films and would not have vetoed Spielberg.[103] Rowling's first choice for the director had been Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, but Warner Bros. wanted a family-friendly film and chose Columbus.[104] Rowling had gained some creative control over the films, reviewing all the scripts[105] as well as acting as a producer on the final two-part instalment, Deathly Hallows.[106] Rowling, producers David Heyman and David Barron, along with directors David Yates, Mike Newell and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema at the 2011 British Academy Film Awards in honour of the Harry Potter film franchise.[107] In September 2013, Warner Bros. announced an \"expanded creative partnership\" with Rowling, based on a planned series of films about her character Newt Scamander, author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The first film was released in November 2016 and is set roughly 70 years before the events of the main series.[108] In 2016, it was announced that the series would consist of five films. The second, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released in November 2018.[109] Rowling scripted and co-produced both films. In 2004, Forbes named Rowling as the first person to become a US-dollar billionaire by writing books,[110] the second-richest female entertainer and the 1,062nd richest person in the world.[111] Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire.[112] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3600\u00a0million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160\u00a0million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK meant she was no longer a billionaire.[113] In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.[114] Rowling acquired the courtesy title of Laird of Killiechassie in 2001 when she purchased the historic Killiechassie House, and its surrounding estate situated on the banks of the River Tay, near Aberfeldy, in Perth and Kinross.[115][116] Rowling also owns a \u00a34.5\u00a0million Georgian house in Kensington, west London, on a street with 24-hour security.[117] In 2017, Rowling was worth an estimated \u00a3650\u00a0million according to the Sunday Times Rich List.[118] She was named the most highly paid author in the world with earnings of \u00a372\u00a0million ($95\u00a0million) a year by Forbes in 2017.[119] On 26 December 2001, Rowling married Neil Murray (born 30 June 1971), a Scottish doctor,[120] in a private ceremony at her home, Killiechassie House in Scotland.[121] Their son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born on 24 March 2003.[122] Shortly after Rowling began writing Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she ceased working on the novel to care for David in his early infancy.[123] Rowling is a friend of Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project. When Sarah Brown's son Fraser was born in 2003, Rowling was one of the first to visit her in hospital.[124] Rowling's youngest child, daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray, to whom she dedicated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was born on 23 January 2005.[125] In October 2012, a New Yorker magazine article stated that the Rowling family lived in a seventeenth-century Edinburgh house, concealed at the front by tall conifer hedges. Prior to October 2012, Rowling lived near the author Ian Rankin, who later said she was quiet and introspective, and that she seemed in her element with children.[25][126] As of June\u00a02014[update], the family resides in Scotland.[127] In July 2011, Rowling parted company with her agent, Christopher Little, moving to a new agency founded by one of his staff, Neil Blair.[25][128] On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, announced on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new book would be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012.[129] Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre,[130] the Cheltenham Literature Festival,[131] Charlie Rose[132] and the Lennoxlove Book Festival.[133] In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[134] On 3 December 2012, it was announced that the BBC would be adapting The Casual Vacancy into a television drama miniseries. Rowling's agent, Neil Blair acted as producer, through his independent production company and with Rick Senat serving as executive producer. Rowling collaborated on the adaptation, serving as an executive producer for the series. The series aired in three parts from 15 February to 1 March 2015.[135][136] In 2007, during the Edinburgh Book Festival, author Ian Rankin claimed that his wife spotted Rowling \"scribbling away\" at a detective novel in a caf\u00e9.[137] Rankin later retracted the story, claiming it was a joke,[138] but the rumour persisted, with a report in 2012 in The Guardian speculating that Rowling's next book would be a crime novel.[139] In an interview with Stephen Fry in 2005, Rowling had claimed that she would much prefer to write any subsequent books under a pseudonym, but had previously conceded to Jeremy Paxman in 2003 that if she did, the press would probably \"find out in seconds\".[140] In April 2013, Little Brown published The Cuckoo's Calling, the purported d\u00e9but novel of author Robert Galbraith, whom the publisher described as \"a former plainclothes Royal Military Police investigator who had left in 2003 to work in the civilian security industry\".[141] The novel, a detective story in which private investigator Cormoran Strike unravels the supposed suicide of a supermodel, sold 1,500 copies in hardback (although the matter was not resolved as of 21\u00a0July\u00a02013[update]; later reports stated that this number is the number of copies that were printed for the first run, while the sales total was closer to 500)[142] and received acclaim from other crime writers[141] and critics[143]\u2014a Publishers Weekly review called the book a \"stellar debut\",[144] while the Library Journal's mystery section pronounced the novel \"the debut of the month\".[145] India Knight, a novelist and columnist for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 that she had been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a d\u00e9but novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply.[146] Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation.[146][147] After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym.[147] Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%,[146] and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand.[148] As of 18\u00a0July\u00a02013[update], a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (\u00a32,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (\u00a33,950).[142] Rowling said that she had enjoyed working under a pseudonym.[149] On her Robert Galbraith website, Rowling explained that she took the name from one of her personal heroes, Robert Kennedy, and a childhood fantasy name she had invented for herself, Ella Galbraith.[150] Soon after the revelation, Brooks pondered whether Jude Callegari could have been Rowling as part of wider speculation that the entire affair had been a publicity stunt. Some also noted that many of the writers who had initially praised the book, such as Alex Gray or Val McDermid,[151] were within Rowling's circle of acquaintances; both vociferously denied any foreknowledge of Rowling's authorship.[146] Judith \"Jude\" Callegari was the best friend of the wife of Chris Gossage, a partner within Russells Solicitors, Rowling's legal representatives.[152][153] Rowling released a statement saying she was disappointed and angry;[152] Russells apologised for the leak, confirming it was not part of a marketing stunt and that \"the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he [Gossage] trusted implicitly\".[148] Russells made a donation to the Soldiers' Charity on Rowling's behalf and reimbursed her for her legal fees.[154] On 26 November 2013 the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) issued Gossage a written rebuke and \u00a31,000 fine for breaching privacy rules.[155] On 17 February 2014, Rowling announced that the second Cormoran Strike novel, named The Silkworm, would be released in June 2014. It sees Strike investigating the disappearance of a writer hated by many of his old friends for insulting them in his new novel.[156] In 2015, Rowling stated on Galbraith's website that the third Cormoran Strike novel would include \"an insane amount of planning, the most I have done for any book I have written so far. I have colour-coded spreadsheets so I can keep a track of where I am going.\"[157] On 24 April 2015, Rowling announced that work on the third book was completed. Titled Career of Evil, it was released on 20 October 2015 in the United States, and on 22 October 2015 in the United Kingdom.[158] In 2017, the BBC released a Cormoran Strike television series, starring Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike, it was picked up by HBO for distribution in the United States and Canada.[159] In March 2017, Rowling revealed the fourth novel's title via Twitter in a game of \"Hangman\" with her followers. After many failed attempts, followers finally guessed correctly. Rowling confirmed that the next novel's title is Lethal White.[160] While intended for a 2017 release, Rowling tweeted the book was taking longer than expected and would be the longest book in the series thus far.[161][162] The book was released 18 September 2018.[163] Rowling has said it is unlikely she will write any more books in the Harry Potter series.[164] In October 2007 she stated that her future work was unlikely to be in the fantasy genre.[165] On 1 October 2010, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rowling stated a new book on the saga might happen.[166] In 2007, Rowling stated that she planned to write an encyclopaedia of Harry Potter's wizarding world consisting of various unpublished material and notes.[167] Any profits from such a book would be given to charity.[168] During a news conference at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre in 2007, Rowling, when asked how the encyclopaedia was coming along, said, \"It's not coming along, and I haven't started writing it. I never said it was the next thing I'd do.\"[169] At the end of 2007, Rowling said that the encyclopaedia could take up to ten years to complete.[170] In June 2011, Rowling announced that future Harry Potter projects, and all electronic downloads, would be concentrated in a new website, called Pottermore.[171] The site includes 18,000 words of information on characters, places and objects in the Harry Potter universe.[172] In October 2015, Rowling announced via Pottermore that a two-part play she had co-authored with playwrights Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, was the \"eighth Harry Potter story\" and that it would focus on the life of Harry Potter's youngest son Albus after the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[173] On 28 October 2015, the first round of tickets went on sale and sold out in several hours.[174] In 2000, Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its annual budget of \u00a35.1\u00a0million to combat poverty and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one-parent families, and multiple sclerosis research.[175][176] Rowling, once a single parent, is now president of the charity Gingerbread (originally One Parent Families), having become their first Ambassador in 2000.[177][178] Rowling collaborated with Sarah Brown to write a book of children's stories to aid One Parent Families.[179] In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors\u00a0\u2013 cookery writer and TV presenter Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling\u00a0\u2013 to submit booklets related to their most famous works for publication.[180] Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised \u00a315.7\u00a0million for the fund. The \u00a310.8\u00a0million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis.[181] In 2002, Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping to raise money for the National Council for One Parent Families.[182] In 2005, Rowling and MEP Emma Nicholson founded the Children's High Level Group (now Lumos).[183] In January 2006, Rowling went to Bucharest to highlight the use of caged beds in mental institutions for children.[184] To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for \u00a31.95\u00a0million by online bookseller Amazon.com on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction.[185][185][186] Rowling gave away the remaining six copies to those who have a close connection with the Harry Potter books.[185] In 2008, Rowling agreed to publish the book with the proceeds going to Lumos.[126] On 1 June 2010 (International Children's Day), Lumos launched an annual initiative \u2013 Light a Birthday Candle for Lumos.[187] In November 2013, Rowling handed over all earnings from the sale of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, totalling nearly \u00a319\u00a0million.[188] In July 2012, Rowling was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London, where she read a few lines from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan as part of a tribute to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. An inflatable representation of Lord Voldemort and other children's literary characters accompanied her reading.[189] Rowling has contributed money and support for research and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward the creation of a new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.[190] In 2010, she donated another \u00a310\u00a0million to the centre,[191] and in 2019 a further \u00a315 million.[192] For unknown reasons, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers.[193] In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.[193] In May 2008, bookseller Waterstones asked Rowling and 12 other writers (Lisa Appignanesi, Margaret Atwood, Lauren Child, Sebastian Faulks, Richard Ford, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby, Doris Lessing, Michael Rosen, Axel Scheffler, Tom Stoppard and Irvine Welsh) to compose a short piece of their own choosing on a single A5 card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. The cards were collated and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.[194] On 1 and 2 August 2006, she read alongside Stephen King and John Irving at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Profits from the event were donated to the Haven Foundation, a charity that aids artists and performers left uninsurable and unable to work, and the medical NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.[195] In May 2007, Rowling pledged a donation reported as over \u00a3250,000 to a reward fund started by the tabloid News of the World for the safe return of a young British girl, Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal.[196] Rowling, along with Nelson Mandela, Al Gore, and Alan Greenspan, wrote an introduction to a collection of Gordon Brown's speeches, the proceeds of which were donated to the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory.[197] After her exposure as the true author of The Cuckoo's Calling led to a massive increase in sales, Rowling announced she would donate all her royalties to the Army Benevolent Fund, claiming she had always intended to but never expected the book to be a best-seller.[198] Rowling is a member of both English PEN and Scottish PEN. She was one of 50 authors to contribute to First Editions, Second Thoughts, a charity auction for English PEN. Each author hand annotated a first-edition copy of one of their books, in Rowling's case, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The book was the highest-selling lot of the event and fetched \u00a3150,000 ($228,600).[199] Rowling is a supporter of the Shannon Trust, which runs the Toe by Toe Reading Plan and the Shannon Reading Plan in prisons across Britain, helping and giving tutoring to prisoners who cannot read.[200] Rowling has named communist and civil rights activist Jessica Mitford as her greatest influence. She said \"Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War\", and claims what inspired her about Mitford was that she was \"incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target\".[201] Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author,[202] calling Emma her favourite book in O, The Oprah Magazine.[203] As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.[204] Rowling is known for her centre-left political views. In September 2008, on the eve of the Labour Party Conference, Rowling announced that she had donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Labour Party, and publicly endorsed Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown over Conservative challenger David Cameron, praising Labour's policies on child poverty.[205] Rowling is a close friend of Sarah Brown, wife of Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project for One Parent Families.[124] Rowling discussed the 2008 United States presidential election with the Spanish-language newspaper El Pa\u00eds in February 2008, stating that the election would have a profound effect on the rest of the world. She also said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would be \"extraordinary\" in the White House. In the same interview, Rowling identified Robert F. Kennedy as her hero.[206] In April 2010, Rowling published an article in The Times, in which she criticised Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a \u00a3150 annual tax credit: \"Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say 'it's not the money, it's the message'. When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money. When you find yourself contemplating shoplifting to get nappies, it is the money.\"[207] As a resident of Scotland, Rowling was eligible to vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, and campaigned for the \"No\" vote.[208] She donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Better Together anti-independence campaign (run by her former neighbour Alistair Darling),[127] the largest donation it had received at the time. In a blog post, Rowling explained that an open letter from Scottish medical professionals raised problems with First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for a common research funding.[127] Rowling compared some Scottish Nationalists with the Death Eaters, characters from Harry Potter who are scornful of those without pure blood.[209] On 22 October 2015 a letter was published in The Guardian signed by Rowling (along with over 150 other figures from arts and politics) opposing the cultural boycott of Israel, and announcing the creation of a network for dialogue, called Culture for Coexistence.[210] Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine.[211] In June 2016, Rowling campaigned for the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union, in the run up to the Referendum to leave the European Union, stating on her website that, \"I'm the mongrel product of this European continent and I'm an internationalist. I was raised by a Francophile mother whose family was proud of their part-French heritage ... My values are not contained or proscribed by borders. The absence of a visa when I cross the channel has symbolic value to me. I might not be in my house, but I'm still in my hometown.\"[212] Rowling expressed concern that \"racists and bigots\" were directing parts of the Leave campaign. In a blog post, she added: \"How can a retreat into selfish and insecure individualism be the right response when Europe faces genuine threats, when the bonds that tie us are so powerful, when we have come so far together? How can we hope to conquer the enormous challenges of terrorism and climate change without cooperation and collaboration?\"[213] In December 2019, Rowling faced criticism for supporting Maya Forstater, after a court ruled that Forstater's anti-transgender views were not protected beliefs.[214][215] Media outlets stated that Rowling had expressed controversial views on transgender issues prior to this incident, with some describing her as a trans-exclusionary feminist whose views are transphobic.[216][217] Over the years, some religious people, particularly Christians, have decried Rowling's books for supposedly promoting witchcraft. Rowling identifies as a Christian.[218] She once said, \"I believe in God, not magic.\"[219] Early on she felt that if readers knew of her Christian beliefs they would be able to predict plot lines of characters in her books.[220] In 2007, Rowling said she was the only one in her family who went regularly to church; she was an adherent of the Church of England. As a student she became annoyed at the \"smugness of religious people\" and attended less often. Later, she started to attend a Church of Scotland congregation at the time she was writing Harry Potter.[221][222] Her eldest daughter, Jessica, was baptised there.[218] In a 2006 interview with Tatler magazine, Rowling noted that, \"like Graham Greene, my faith is sometimes about if my faith will return. It's important to me.\"[18] She has said that she has struggled with doubt, that she believes in an afterlife,[223] and that her faith plays a part in her books.[224][225][226] In a 2012 radio interview, she said that she was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, a province of the Anglican Communion.[227] In 2015, following the referendum on same-sex marriage in Ireland, Rowling joked that if Ireland legalised same-sex marriage, Dumbledore and Gandalf could get married there.[228] The Westboro Baptist Church, in response, stated that if the two got married, they would picket. Rowling responded by saying \"Alas, the sheer awesomeness of such a union in such a place would blow your tiny bigoted minds out of your thick sloping skulls.\"[229] Rowling has had a difficult relationship with the press. She admits to being \"thin-skinned\" and dislikes the fickle nature of reporting. Rowling disputes that she is a recluse who hates to be interviewed.[230] By 2011, Rowling had taken more than 50 actions against the press.[231] In 2001, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint by Rowling over a series of unauthorised photographs of her with her daughter on the beach in Mauritius published in OK! magazine.[232] In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of David. The photo which was taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was then published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood.[17] The judgement was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.[233] Rowling particularly dislikes the British tabloid the Daily Mail, which has conducted interviews with her estranged ex-husband. As one journalist noted, \"Harry's Uncle Vernon is a grotesque philistine of violent tendencies and remarkably little brain. It is not difficult to guess which newspaper Rowling gives him to read [in Goblet of Fire].\"[234] As of January\u00a02014[update], she was seeking damages from the Mail for libel over an article about her time as a single mother.[235] Some have speculated that Rowling's fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character Rita Skeeter, a gossipy celebrity journalist who first appears in Goblet of Fire, but Rowling noted in 2000 that the character predates her rise to fame.[236] In September 2011, Rowling was named a \"core participant\" in the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press, as one of dozens of celebrities who may have been the victim of phone hacking.[237] On 24 November 2011, Rowling gave evidence before the inquiry; although she was not suspected to have been the victim of phone hacking,[238] her testimony included accounts of photographers camping on her doorstep, her fianc\u00e9 being duped into giving his home address to a journalist masquerading as a tax official,[238] her chasing a journalist a week after giving birth,[231] a journalist leaving a note inside her then-five-year-old daughter's schoolbag, and an attempt by The Sun to \"blackmail\" her into a photo opportunity in exchange for the return of a stolen manuscript.[239] Rowling claimed she had to leave her former home in Merchiston because of press intrusion.[239] In November 2012, Rowling wrote an article for The Guardian in reaction to David Cameron's decision not to implement the full recommendations of the Leveson inquiry, saying she felt \"duped and angry\".[240] In 2014, Rowling reaffirmed her support for \"Hacked Off\" and its campaign towards press self-regulation by co-signing with other British celebrities a declaration to \"[safeguard] the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.\"[241] Rowling, her publishers, and Time Warner, the owner of the rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.[242] Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date.[243] The injunction drew fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the \"right to read\".[244][245] Rowling has received honorary degrees from St Andrews University, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Napier University, the University of Exeter (which she attended),[246] the University of Aberdeen,[247][248] and Harvard University, where she spoke at the 2008 commencement ceremony.[249] In 2009 Rowling was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[31] In 2002, Rowling became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE)[250] as well a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL).[251] She was furthermore recognized as Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 2011 for services to Literature and Philanthropy.[252] Other awards include:[72]",

Rowling, is a British author, film producer, television producer, screenwriter, and philanthropist. She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500\u00a0million copies,[2][3] becoming the best-selling book series in history.[4] The books are the basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts[5] and was a producer on the final films.[6] She also writes crime fiction under the name Robert Galbraith.\nBorn in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.[7] The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written five books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and\u2014under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith\u2014the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series, which consists of The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015), and Lethal White (2018).[8]\nRowling has lived a \"rags to riches\" life in which she progressed from living on benefits to being the world's first billionaire author.[9] She lost her billionaire status after giving away much of her earnings to charity but remains one of the wealthiest people in the world.[10] She is the UK's best-selling living author, with sales in excess of \u00a3238 million.[11] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3600\u00a0million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] Time named her a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans.[13] In October 2010, Rowling was named the \"Most Influential Woman in Britain\" by leading magazine editors.[14] She has supported multiple charities, including Comic Relief, One Parent Families, and Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain, as well as launching her own charity, Lumos.\nAlthough she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, her name, before her remarriage, was Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother.[15] She calls herself Jo.[16] Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.[17][18] During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling[19] and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.[20]\nJoanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965[21][22] in Yate, Gloucestershire,[23][24] the daughter of science technician Anne (n\u00e9e Volant) and Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer Peter James Rowling.[25][26] Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.[27] They married on 14 March 1965.[27] One of Rowling's maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was a Scottish man from Lamlash.[28][29] Her mother's French paternal grandfather, Louis Volant,[30] was awarded the War Cross for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during World War I. Rowling originally believed Volant had won the Legion of Honour during the war, as she said when she received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are? in which she found out it was a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard her grandfather's story of bravery and discovered that the War Cross was for \"ordinary\" soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the War Cross was \"better\" to her than the Legion of Honour.[31][32]\nRowling's sister Dianne[7] was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old.[24] The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four.[33] As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories which she frequently read to her sister.[1] Aged nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales.[24] When she was a young teenager, her great-aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels.[34] Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling read all of her books.[35]\nRowling has said that her teenage years were unhappy.[25] Her home life was complicated by her mother's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis[36] and a strained relationship with her father, with whom she is not on speaking terms.[25] Rowling later said that she based the character of Hermione Granger on herself when she was eleven.[37] Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.[38] Like many teenagers, she became interested in rock music, listening to the Clash,[39] the Smiths, and Siouxsie Sioux, adopting the look of the latter with back-combed hair and black eyeliner, a look that she would still sport when beginning university.[40]\nAs a child, Rowling attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More.[41][42] Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.[43] She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother worked in the science department.[26] Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English\".[25] Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B[27] and was head girl.[25]\nIn 1982, Rowling took the entrance exams for Oxford University but was not accepted[25] and earned a BA in French and Classics at the University of Exeter.[44][45][46] Martin Sorrell, a French professor at Exeter, remembers \"a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, gave the appearance of doing what was necessary\".[25] Rowling recalls doing little work, preferring to read Dickens and Tolkien.[25] After a year of study in Paris, Rowling graduated from Exeter in 1986.[25] In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying Classics titled \"What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled\"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[47]\nAfter working as a researcher and bilingual secretary in London for Amnesty International,[48] Rowling moved with her then boyfriend to Manchester,[24] where she worked at the Chamber of Commerce.[27] In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry \"came fully formed\" into her mind.[24][49]\nWhen she had reached her Clapham Junction flat, she began to write immediately.[24][50] In December, Rowling's mother, Anne, died after ten years suffering from multiple sclerosis.[24] Rowling was writing Harry Potter at the time and had never told her mother about it.[18] Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing,[18] and she channelled her own feelings of loss by writing about Harry's own feelings of loss in greater detail in the first book.[51]\nAn advertisement in The Guardian[27] led Rowling to move to Porto, Portugal, to teach English as a foreign language.[7][35] She taught at night and began writing in the day while listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.[25] After 18 months in Porto, she met Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found they shared an interest in Jane Austen.[27] They married on 16 October 1992 and their child, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford), was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal.[27] Rowling had previously suffered a miscarriage.[27] The couple separated on 17 November 1993.[27][52] Biographers have suggested that Rowling suffered domestic abuse during her marriage, although the extent is unknown.[27][53] In December 1993, Rowling and her then infant daughter moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, to be near Rowling's sister[24] with three chapters of what would become Harry Potter in her suitcase.[25]\nSeven years after graduating from university, Rowling saw herself as a failure.[54] Her marriage had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child, but she described her failure as liberating and allowing her to focus on writing.[54] During this period, Rowling was diagnosed with clinical depression and contemplated suicide.[55] Her illness inspired the characters known as Dementors, soul-sucking creatures introduced in the third book.[56] Rowling signed up for welfare benefits, describing her economic status as being \"poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless.\"[25][54]\nRowling was left in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter.[27] She obtained an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994.[27] She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University,[57] after completing her first novel while living on state benefits.[58] She wrote in many caf\u00e9s, especially Nicolson's Caf\u00e9 (owned by her brother-in-law),[59][60] and the Elephant House,[61] wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep.[24][62] In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local caf\u00e9s to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in caf\u00e9s was that taking her baby out for a walk was the best way to make her fall asleep.[62]\nIn 1995, Rowling finished her manuscript for Harry Potter and the  Philosopher's Stone which was typed on an old manual typewriter.[64] Upon the enthusiastic response of Bryony Evens, a reader who had been asked to review the book's first three chapters, the Fulham-based Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript.[27] A year later she was finally given the green light (and a \u00a31,500 advance) by editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury, a publishing house in London.[27][65] The decision to publish Rowling's book owes much to Alice Newton, the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chairman, who was given the first chapter to review by her father and immediately demanded the next.[66] Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little chance of making money in children's books.[67] Soon after, in 1997, Rowling received an \u00a38,000 grant from the Scottish Arts Council to enable her to continue writing.[68]\nIn June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued between \u00a316,000 and \u00a325,000.[69] Five months later, the book won its first award, a Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize. In February, the novel won the British Book Award for Children's Book of the Year, and later, the Children's Book Award. In early 1998, an auction was held in the United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by Scholastic Inc., for US$105,000. Rowling said that she \"nearly died\" when she heard the news.[70] In October 1998, Scholastic published Philosopher's Stone in the US under the title of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a change Rowling says she now regrets and would have fought if she had been in a better position at the time.[71] Rowling moved from her flat with the money from the Scholastic sale, into 19 Hazelbank Terrace in Edinburgh.[59]\nIts sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in July 1998 and again Rowling won the Smarties Prize.[72] In December 1999, the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, won the Smarties Prize, making Rowling the first person to win the award three times running.[73] She later withdrew the fourth Harry Potter novel from contention to allow other books a fair chance. In January 2000, Prisoner of Azkaban won the inaugural Whitbread Children's Book of the Year award, though it lost the Book of the Year prize to Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.[74]\nThe fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was released simultaneously in the UK and the US on 8 July 2000 and broke sales records in both countries. 372,775 copies of the book were sold in its first day in the UK, almost equalling the number Prisoner of Azkaban sold during its first year.[75] In the US, the book sold three million copies in its first 48 hours, smashing all records.[75] Rowling said that she had had a crisis while writing the novel and had to rewrite one chapter many times to fix a problem with the plot.[76] Rowling was named Author of the Year in the 2000 British Book Awards.[77]\nA wait of three years occurred between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied.[78] Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, that it could have been shorter, and that she ran out of time and energy as she tried to finish it.[79]\nThe sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 16 July 2005. It too broke all sales records, selling nine million copies in its first 24 hours of release.[80] In 2006, Half-Blood Prince received the Book of the Year prize at the British Book Awards.[72]\nThe title of the seventh and final Harry Potter book was announced on 21 December 2006 as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[81] In February 2007 it was reported that Rowling wrote on a bust in her hotel room at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh that she had finished the seventh book in that room on 11 January 2007.[82] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:01 BST)[83] and broke its predecessor's record as the fastest-selling book of all time.[84] It sold 11\u00a0million copies in the first day of release in the United Kingdom and United States.[84] The book's last chapter was one of the earliest things she wrote in the entire series.[85]\nHarry Potter is now a global brand worth an estimated US$15\u00a0billion,[86] and the last four Harry Potter books have consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.[84][87] The series, totalling 4,195 pages,[88] has been translated, in whole or in part, into 65 languages.[89]\nThe Harry Potter books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when children were thought to be abandoning books for computers and television,[90] although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.[91]\nIn October 1998, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the first two novels for a seven-figure sum.[92] A film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released on 16 November 2001, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on 15 November 2002.[93] Both films were directed by Chris Columbus. The film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released on 4 June 2004, directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. The fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was directed by Mike Newell, and released on 18 November 2005. The film of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released on 11 July 2007.[93] David Yates directed, and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay, having taken over the position from Steve Kloves. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released on 15 July 2009.[94] David Yates directed again, and Kloves returned to write the script.[95] Warner Bros. filmed the final instalment of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in two segments, with part one being released on 19 November 2010 and part two being released on 15 July 2011. Yates directed both films.[96][97]\nWarner Bros. took considerable notice of Rowling's desires when drafting her contract. One of her principal stipulations was the films be shot in Britain with an all-British cast,[98] which has been generally adhered to. Rowling also demanded that Coca-Cola, the winner in the race to tie in their products to the film series, donate US$18\u00a0million to the American charity Reading Is Fundamental, as well as several community charity programs.[99]\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film; Rowling assisted him in the writing process, ensuring that his scripts did not contradict future books in the series.[100] She told Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) certain secrets about their characters before they were revealed in the books.[101] Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) asked her if Harry died at any point in the series; Rowling answered him by saying, \"You have a death scene\", thereby not explicitly answering the question.[102] Director Steven Spielberg was approached to direct the first film, but dropped out. The press has repeatedly claimed that Rowling played a role in his departure, but Rowling stated that she had no say in who directed the films and would not have vetoed Spielberg.[103] Rowling's first choice for the director had been Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, but Warner Bros. wanted a family-friendly film and chose Columbus.[104]\nRowling had gained some creative control over the films, reviewing all the scripts[105] as well as acting as a producer on the final two-part instalment, Deathly Hallows.[106]\nRowling, producers David Heyman and David Barron, along with directors David Yates, Mike Newell and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema at the 2011 British Academy Film Awards in honour of the Harry Potter film franchise.[107]\nIn September 2013, Warner Bros. announced an \"expanded creative partnership\" with Rowling, based on a planned series of films about her character Newt Scamander, author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The first film was released in November 2016 and is set roughly 70 years before the events of the main series.[108] In 2016, it was announced that the series would consist of five films. The second, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released in November 2018.[109] Rowling scripted and co-produced both films.\nIn 2004, Forbes named Rowling as the first person to become a US-dollar billionaire by writing books,[110] the second-richest female entertainer and the 1,062nd richest person in the world.[111] Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire.[112] The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3600\u00a0million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK.[12] In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160\u00a0million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK meant she was no longer a billionaire.[113] In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.[114]\nRowling  acquired  the  courtesy title  of  Laird  of  Killiechassie in  2001 when  she  purchased the historic Killiechassie House, and its  surrounding  estate   situated on the banks of the River Tay, near Aberfeldy, in Perth and Kinross.[115][116] Rowling also owns a \u00a34.5\u00a0million Georgian house in Kensington, west London, on a street with 24-hour security.[117]\nIn 2017, Rowling was worth an estimated \u00a3650\u00a0million according to the Sunday Times Rich List.[118] She was named the most highly paid author in the world with earnings of \u00a372\u00a0million ($95\u00a0million) a year by Forbes in 2017.[119]\nOn 26 December 2001, Rowling married Neil Murray (born 30 June 1971), a Scottish doctor,[120] in a private ceremony at her home, Killiechassie House in Scotland.[121] Their son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born on 24 March 2003.[122] Shortly after Rowling began writing Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she ceased working on the novel to care for David in his early infancy.[123]\nRowling is a friend of Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project. When Sarah Brown's son Fraser was born in 2003, Rowling was one of the first to visit her in hospital.[124] Rowling's youngest child, daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray, to whom she dedicated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was born on 23 January 2005.[125]\nIn October 2012, a New Yorker magazine article stated that the Rowling family lived in a seventeenth-century Edinburgh house, concealed at the front by tall conifer hedges. Prior to October 2012, Rowling lived near the author Ian Rankin, who later said she was quiet and introspective, and that she seemed in her element with children.[25][126] As of June\u00a02014[update], the family resides in Scotland.[127]\nIn July 2011, Rowling parted company with her agent, Christopher Little, moving to a new agency founded by one of his staff, Neil Blair.[25][128] On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, announced on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new book would be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012.[129] Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre,[130] the Cheltenham Literature Festival,[131] Charlie Rose[132] and the Lennoxlove Book Festival.[133] In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[134]\nOn 3 December 2012, it was announced that the BBC would be adapting The Casual Vacancy into a television drama miniseries. Rowling's agent, Neil Blair acted as producer, through his independent production company and with Rick Senat serving as executive producer. Rowling collaborated on the adaptation, serving as an executive producer for the series. The series aired in three parts from 15 February to 1 March 2015.[135][136]\nIn 2007, during the Edinburgh Book Festival, author Ian Rankin claimed that his wife spotted Rowling \"scribbling away\" at a detective novel in a caf\u00e9.[137] Rankin later retracted the story, claiming it was a joke,[138] but the rumour persisted, with a report in 2012 in The Guardian speculating that Rowling's next book would be a crime novel.[139] In an interview with Stephen Fry in 2005, Rowling had claimed that she would much prefer to write any subsequent books under a pseudonym, but had previously conceded to Jeremy Paxman in 2003 that if she did, the press would probably \"find out in seconds\".[140]\nIn April 2013, Little Brown published The Cuckoo's Calling, the purported d\u00e9but novel of author Robert Galbraith, whom the publisher described as \"a former plainclothes Royal Military Police investigator who had left in 2003 to work in the civilian security industry\".[141] The novel, a detective story in which private investigator Cormoran Strike unravels the supposed suicide of a supermodel, sold 1,500 copies in hardback (although the matter was not resolved as of 21\u00a0July\u00a02013[update]; later reports stated that this number is the number of copies that were printed for the first run, while the sales total was closer to 500)[142] and received acclaim from other crime writers[141] and critics[143]\u2014a Publishers Weekly review called the book a \"stellar debut\",[144] while the Library Journal's mystery section pronounced the novel \"the debut of the month\".[145]\nIndia Knight, a novelist and columnist for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 that she had been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a d\u00e9but novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply.[146] Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation.[146][147] After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym.[147] Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%,[146] and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand.[148] As of 18\u00a0July\u00a02013[update], a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (\u00a32,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (\u00a33,950).[142]\nRowling said that she had enjoyed working under a pseudonym.[149] On her Robert Galbraith website, Rowling explained that she took the name from one of her personal heroes, Robert Kennedy, and a childhood fantasy name she had invented for herself, Ella Galbraith.[150]\nSoon after the revelation, Brooks pondered whether Jude Callegari could have been Rowling as part of wider speculation that the entire affair had been a publicity stunt. Some also noted that many of the writers who had initially praised the book, such as Alex Gray or Val McDermid,[151] were within Rowling's circle of acquaintances; both vociferously denied any foreknowledge of Rowling's authorship.[146] Judith \"Jude\" Callegari was the best friend of the wife of Chris Gossage, a partner within Russells Solicitors, Rowling's legal representatives.[152][153] Rowling released a statement saying she was disappointed and angry;[152] Russells apologised for the leak, confirming it was not part of a marketing stunt and that \"the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he [Gossage] trusted implicitly\".[148] Russells made a donation to the Soldiers' Charity on Rowling's behalf and reimbursed her for her legal fees.[154] On 26 November 2013 the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) issued Gossage a written rebuke and \u00a31,000 fine for breaching privacy rules.[155]\nOn 17 February 2014, Rowling announced that the second Cormoran Strike novel, named The Silkworm, would be released in June 2014. It sees Strike investigating the disappearance of a writer hated by many of his old friends for insulting them in his new novel.[156]\nIn 2015, Rowling stated on Galbraith's website that the third Cormoran Strike novel would include \"an insane amount of planning, the most I have done for any book I have written so far. I have colour-coded spreadsheets so I can keep a track of where I am going.\"[157] On 24 April 2015, Rowling announced that work on the third book was completed. Titled Career of Evil, it was released on 20 October 2015 in the United States, and on 22 October 2015 in the United Kingdom.[158]\nIn 2017, the BBC released a Cormoran Strike television series, starring Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike, it was picked up by HBO for distribution in the United States and Canada.[159]\nIn March 2017, Rowling revealed the fourth novel's title via Twitter in a game of \"Hangman\" with her followers. After many failed attempts, followers finally guessed correctly. Rowling confirmed that the next novel's title is Lethal White.[160] While intended for a 2017 release, Rowling tweeted the book was taking longer than expected and would be the longest book in the series thus far.[161][162] The book was released 18 September 2018.[163]\nRowling has said it is unlikely she will write any more books in the Harry Potter series.[164] In October 2007 she stated that her future work was unlikely to be in the fantasy genre.[165] On 1 October 2010, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rowling stated a new book on the saga might happen.[166]\nIn 2007, Rowling stated that she planned to write an encyclopaedia of Harry Potter's wizarding world consisting of various unpublished material and notes.[167] Any profits from such a book would be given to charity.[168] During a news conference at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre in 2007, Rowling, when asked how the encyclopaedia was coming along, said, \"It's not coming along, and I haven't started writing it. I never said it was the next thing I'd do.\"[169] At the end of 2007, Rowling said that the encyclopaedia could take up to ten years to complete.[170]\nIn June 2011, Rowling announced that future Harry Potter projects, and all electronic downloads, would be concentrated in a new website, called Pottermore.[171] The site includes 18,000 words of information on characters, places and objects in the Harry Potter universe.[172]\nIn October 2015, Rowling announced via Pottermore that a two-part play she had co-authored with playwrights Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, was the \"eighth Harry Potter story\" and that it would focus on the life of Harry Potter's youngest son Albus after the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[173] On 28 October 2015, the first round of tickets went on sale and sold out in several hours.[174]\nIn 2000, Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its annual budget of \u00a35.1\u00a0million to combat poverty and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one-parent families, and multiple sclerosis research.[175][176]\nRowling, once a single parent, is now president of the charity Gingerbread (originally One Parent Families), having become their first Ambassador in 2000.[177][178] Rowling collaborated with Sarah Brown to write a book of children's stories to aid One Parent Families.[179]\nIn 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors\u00a0\u2013 cookery writer and TV presenter Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling\u00a0\u2013 to submit booklets related to their most famous works for publication.[180] Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised \u00a315.7\u00a0million for the fund. The \u00a310.8\u00a0million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis.[181] In 2002, Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping to raise money for the National Council for One Parent Families.[182]\nIn 2005, Rowling and MEP Emma Nicholson founded the Children's High Level Group (now Lumos).[183] In January 2006, Rowling went to Bucharest to highlight the use of caged beds in mental institutions for children.[184] To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for \u00a31.95\u00a0million by online bookseller Amazon.com on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction.[185][185][186] Rowling gave away the remaining six copies to those who have a close connection with the Harry Potter books.[185] In 2008, Rowling agreed to publish the book with the proceeds going to Lumos.[126] On 1 June 2010 (International Children's Day), Lumos launched an annual initiative \u2013 Light a Birthday Candle for Lumos.[187] In November 2013, Rowling handed over all earnings from the sale of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, totalling nearly \u00a319\u00a0million.[188]\nIn July 2012, Rowling was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London, where she read a few lines from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan as part of a tribute to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. An inflatable representation of Lord Voldemort and other children's literary characters accompanied her reading.[189]\nRowling has contributed money and support for research and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward the creation of a new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.[190] In 2010, she donated another \u00a310\u00a0million to the centre,[191] and in 2019 a further \u00a315 million.[192] For unknown reasons, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers.[193] In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.[193]\nIn May 2008, bookseller Waterstones asked Rowling and 12 other writers (Lisa Appignanesi, Margaret Atwood, Lauren Child, Sebastian Faulks, Richard Ford, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby, Doris Lessing, Michael Rosen, Axel Scheffler, Tom Stoppard and Irvine Welsh) to compose a short piece of their own choosing on a single A5 card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. The cards were collated and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.[194]\nOn 1 and 2 August 2006, she read alongside Stephen King and John Irving at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Profits from the event were donated to the Haven Foundation, a charity that aids artists and performers left uninsurable and unable to work, and the medical NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.[195] In May 2007, Rowling pledged a donation reported as over \u00a3250,000 to a reward fund started by the tabloid News of the World for the safe return of a young British girl, Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal.[196] Rowling, along with Nelson Mandela, Al Gore, and Alan Greenspan, wrote an introduction to a collection of Gordon Brown's speeches, the proceeds of which were donated to the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory.[197] After her exposure as the true author of The Cuckoo's Calling led to a massive increase in sales, Rowling announced she would donate all her royalties to the Army Benevolent Fund, claiming she had always intended to but never expected the book to be a best-seller.[198]\nRowling is a member of both English PEN and Scottish PEN. She was one of 50 authors to contribute to First Editions, Second Thoughts, a charity auction for English PEN. Each author hand annotated a first-edition copy of one of their books, in Rowling's case, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The book was the highest-selling lot of the event and fetched \u00a3150,000 ($228,600).[199]\nRowling is a supporter of the Shannon Trust, which runs the Toe by Toe Reading Plan and the Shannon Reading Plan in prisons across Britain, helping and giving tutoring to prisoners who cannot read.[200]\nRowling has named communist and civil rights activist Jessica Mitford as her greatest influence. She said \"Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War\", and claims what inspired her about Mitford was that she was \"incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target\".[201] Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author,[202] calling Emma her favourite book in O, The Oprah Magazine.[203] As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.[204]\nRowling is known for her centre-left political views. In September 2008, on the eve of the Labour Party Conference, Rowling announced that she had donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Labour Party, and publicly endorsed Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown over Conservative challenger David Cameron, praising Labour's policies on child poverty.[205] Rowling is a close friend of Sarah Brown, wife of Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project for One Parent Families.[124]\nRowling discussed the 2008 United States presidential election with the Spanish-language newspaper El Pa\u00eds in February 2008, stating that the election would have a profound effect on the rest of the world. She also said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would be \"extraordinary\" in the White House. In the same interview, Rowling identified Robert F. Kennedy as her hero.[206]\nIn April 2010, Rowling published an article in The Times, in which she criticised Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a \u00a3150 annual tax credit: \"Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say 'it's not the money, it's the message'. When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money. When you find yourself contemplating shoplifting to get nappies, it is the money.\"[207]\nAs a resident of Scotland, Rowling was eligible to vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, and campaigned for the \"No\" vote.[208] She donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Better Together anti-independence campaign (run by her former neighbour Alistair Darling),[127] the largest donation it had received at the time. In a blog post, Rowling explained that an open letter from Scottish medical professionals raised problems with First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for a common research funding.[127] Rowling compared some Scottish Nationalists with the Death Eaters, characters from Harry Potter who are scornful of those without pure blood.[209]\nOn 22 October 2015 a letter was published in The Guardian signed by Rowling (along with over 150 other figures from arts and politics) opposing the cultural boycott of Israel, and announcing the creation of a network for dialogue, called Culture for Coexistence.[210] Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine.[211]\nIn June 2016, Rowling campaigned for the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union, in the run up to the Referendum to leave the European Union, stating on her website that, \"I'm the mongrel product of this European continent and I'm an internationalist. I was raised by a Francophile mother whose family was proud of their part-French heritage ... My values are not contained or proscribed by borders. The absence of a visa when I cross the channel has symbolic value to me. I might not be in my house, but I'm still in my hometown.\"[212] Rowling expressed concern that \"racists and bigots\" were directing parts of the Leave campaign. In a blog post, she added: \"How can a retreat into selfish and insecure individualism be the right response when Europe faces genuine threats, when the bonds that tie us are so powerful, when we have come so far together? How can we hope to conquer the enormous challenges of terrorism and climate change without cooperation and collaboration?\"[213]\nIn December 2019, Rowling faced criticism for supporting Maya Forstater, after a court ruled that Forstater's anti-transgender views were not protected beliefs.[214][215] Media outlets stated that Rowling had expressed controversial views on transgender issues prior to this incident, with some describing her as a trans-exclusionary feminist whose views are transphobic.[216][217]\nOver the years, some religious people, particularly Christians, have decried Rowling's books for supposedly promoting witchcraft. Rowling identifies as a Christian.[218] She once said, \"I believe in God, not magic.\"[219] Early on she felt that if readers knew of her Christian beliefs they would be able to predict plot lines of characters in her books.[220]\nIn 2007, Rowling said she was the only one in her family who went regularly to church; she was an adherent of the Church of England. As a student she became annoyed at the \"smugness of religious people\" and attended less often. Later, she started to attend a Church of Scotland congregation at the time she was writing Harry Potter.[221][222] Her eldest daughter, Jessica, was baptised there.[218]\nIn a 2006 interview with Tatler magazine, Rowling noted that, \"like Graham Greene, my faith is sometimes about if my faith will return. It's important to me.\"[18] She has said that she has struggled with doubt, that she believes in an afterlife,[223] and that her faith plays a part in her books.[224][225][226] In a 2012 radio interview, she said that she was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, a province of the Anglican Communion.[227]\nIn 2015, following the referendum on same-sex marriage in Ireland, Rowling joked that if Ireland legalised same-sex marriage, Dumbledore and Gandalf could get married there.[228] The Westboro Baptist Church, in response, stated that if the two got married, they would picket. Rowling responded by saying \"Alas, the sheer awesomeness of such a union in such a place would blow your tiny bigoted minds out of your thick sloping skulls.\"[229]\nRowling has had a difficult relationship with the press. She admits to being \"thin-skinned\" and dislikes the fickle nature of reporting. Rowling disputes that she is a recluse who hates to be interviewed.[230]\nBy 2011, Rowling had taken more than 50 actions against the press.[231] In 2001, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint by Rowling over a series of unauthorised photographs of her with her daughter on the beach in Mauritius published in OK! magazine.[232] In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of David. The photo which was taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was then published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood.[17] The judgement was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.[233]\nRowling particularly dislikes the British tabloid the Daily Mail, which has conducted interviews with her estranged ex-husband. As one journalist noted, \"Harry's Uncle Vernon is a grotesque philistine of violent tendencies and remarkably little brain. It is not difficult to guess which newspaper Rowling gives him to read [in Goblet of Fire].\"[234] As of January\u00a02014[update], she was seeking damages from the Mail for libel over an article about her time as a single mother.[235] Some have speculated that Rowling's fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character Rita Skeeter, a gossipy celebrity journalist who first appears in Goblet of Fire, but Rowling noted in 2000 that the character predates her rise to fame.[236]\nIn September 2011, Rowling was named a \"core participant\" in the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press, as one of dozens of celebrities who may have been the victim of phone hacking.[237] On 24 November 2011, Rowling gave evidence before the inquiry; although she was not suspected to have been the victim of phone hacking,[238] her testimony included accounts of photographers camping on her doorstep, her fianc\u00e9 being duped into giving his home address to a journalist masquerading as a tax official,[238] her chasing a journalist a week after giving birth,[231] a journalist leaving a note inside her then-five-year-old daughter's schoolbag, and an attempt by The Sun to \"blackmail\" her into a photo opportunity in exchange for the return of a stolen manuscript.[239] Rowling claimed she had to leave her former home in Merchiston because of press intrusion.[239] In November 2012, Rowling wrote an article for The Guardian in reaction to David Cameron's decision not to implement the full recommendations of the Leveson inquiry, saying she felt \"duped and angry\".[240]\nIn 2014, Rowling reaffirmed her support for \"Hacked Off\" and its campaign towards press self-regulation by co-signing with other British celebrities a declaration to \"[safeguard] the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.\"[241]\nRowling, her publishers, and Time Warner, the owner of the rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.[242]\nAnother area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date.[243] The injunction drew fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the \"right to read\".[244][245]\nRowling has received honorary degrees from St Andrews University, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Napier University, the University of Exeter (which she attended),[246] the University of Aberdeen,[247][248] and Harvard University, where she spoke at the 2008 commencement ceremony.[249] In 2009 Rowling was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[31] In 2002, Rowling became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE)[250] as well a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL).[251] She was furthermore recognized as Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE) in 2011 for services to Literature and Philanthropy.[252]\nOther awards include:[72]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nPaul Michael Levesque (born July 27, 1969), better known by the ring name Triple H, is an American business executive, professional wrestler, and actor. He has been the Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative for WWE since 2013, as well as being the founder and senior producer of NXT. Levesque was born and raised in Nashua, New Hampshire, and began his professional wrestling career in 1992 with the International Wrestling Federation (IWF) under the ring name Terra Ryzing. In 1994, he joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he was soon repackaged as a French-Canadian aristocrat named Jean-Paul L\u00e9vesque,[5] and was later repackaged in 1995 when he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), where he became Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and later, Triple H.[7] In WWF, Triple H gained industry fame after co-founding the influential D-Generation X stable, which became a major element of the \"Attitude Era\" in the 1990s. After winning his first WWF Championship in 1999, he became a fixture of the company's main event scene,[4][8] and was widely regarded as the best wrestler in North America by the turn of the millennium.[9] Triple H has headlined several major WWE pay-per-view events, closing the company's flagship annual event, WrestleMania, seven times.[a] Triple H has also won a number of championships in his career, being a five-time Intercontinental Champion, a three-time world tag team champion (two World Tag Team Championship reigns, and one Unified WWE Tag Team Championship reign), a two-time European Champion, and a fourteen-time world champion, making him the company's seventh Triple Crown Champion and second Grand Slam Champion. He is also a two-time Royal Rumble match winner, and a King of the Ring tournament winner.[10][11] Later in his career, Triple H gained notability for his behind-the-scenes work at WWE, founding the developmental branch NXT, and gaining praise for his business acumen in professional wrestling.[12][13] Outside of wrestling, Triple H has been a figure of substantial media attention due to his marriage to Stephanie McMahon, daughter of Vince and Linda McMahon, who are majority owners of WWE.[6] In 2019, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the D-Generation X stable. Paul Michael Levesque[14] was born in Nashua, New Hampshire,[15] on July 27, 1969.[5] He has a sister named Lynn.[16] Levesque watched his first wrestling match, involving Chief Jay Strongbow, when he was five years old. He attended Nashua South High School, where he played baseball and basketball.[17] Following his graduation in 1987, Levesque continued to enter bodybuilding competitions\u2014having taken up bodybuilding at the age of 14 because he wanted to look like the professional wrestlers he saw on television\u2014and won the 1988 Mr. Teenage New Hampshire competition at the age of 19.[18][16] While working as a manager of a gym in Nashua, he was introduced to world champion powerlifter Ted Arcidi, who was employed by WWE at the time. Eventually, after numerous attempts, Levesque persuaded Arcidi to introduce him to former wrestler Killer Kowalski, who ran a professional wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts.[citation needed] In early 1992, Levesque began to train as a professional wrestler at Killer Kowalski's school in Malden.[4][17][19] His classmates included fellow future WWF wrestlers Chyna and Perry Saturn. Levesque made his professional debut on March 24, 1992 in Kowalski's promotion, the International Wrestling Federation (IWF), under the name Terra Ryzing. In the match, he defeated Tony Roy.[5] In July 1992, he defeated Mad Dog Richard to win the IWF Heavyweight Championship.[1] Levesque wrestled for various promotions on the East Coast independent circuit until 1994 and during this period he was managed by John Rodeo.[20] In early 1994, Levesque signed a one-year contract with World Championship Wrestling (WCW).[16][21] In his first televised match, Levesque debuted as a villain named Terror Risin', defeating Keith Cole. His ring name was soon modified to Terra Ryzing, which he used until mid-1994, when he was renamed Jean-Paul L\u00e9vesque.[7][22] This gimmick referred to his surname's French origins and he was asked to speak with a French accent, as he could not speak French.[23] During this time, he began using his finishing maneuver, the Pedigree. L\u00e9vesque had a brief feud with Alex Wright that ended at Starrcade[7] with Wright pinning him.[24] Between late 1994 and early 1995, L\u00e9vesque briefly teamed with Lord Steven Regal, whose upper class British persona was similar to L\u00e9vesque's character.[22] However, the team was short-lived. L\u00e9vesque had previously met with Vince McMahon to discuss jumping to the World Wrestling Federation which did not result in his working for the company. However, after McMahon watched L\u00e9vesque's match at Starrcade, an employment offer was made and Levesque left for the WWF in January 1995. In a modified version of his gimmick in WCW, Levesque started his WWF career as a \"Connecticut Blueblood\".[23] According to Levesque, JJ Dillion originally gave him the name of Reginald DuPont Helmsley, but Levesque asked for a name to play with the first letters and management ultimately agreed to his suggestion of Hunter Hearst Helmsley.[25] He appeared in taped vignettes, in which he talked about how to use proper etiquette, up until his wrestling debut on the April 30, 1995 episode of Wrestling Challenge defeating Buck Zumhofe.[26] Helmsley made his WWF pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam, where he defeated Bob Holly.[27] In the fall of 1995, Helmsley began a feud with the hog farmer Henry O. Godwinn, culminating in an infamous Hog Pen match at In Your House 5: Seasons Beatings, where Helmsley was victorious.[28] Although Helmsley was highly promoted in the first few months after his debut, his career stalled during 1996, starting off with a feud with Duke \"The Dumpster\" Droese following a loss during the Free for All at 1996 Royal Rumble.[29][30] Up until that event, his angle included appearing on television each week with a different female valet (which included Playboy Playmates Shae Marks and Tylyn John).[7] Sable was his valet at WrestleMania XII and after his loss to The Ultimate Warrior,[31] as part of the storyline, he took his aggressions out on her. The debuting Marc Mero \u2013 her real-life husband \u2013 came to her rescue, starting a feud between the two wrestlers.[32] On June 1, 1996, Helmsley appeared on an episode of Superstars in a match against Marty Garner.[33] When he attempted to perform the Pedigree, Garner mistook the maneuver for a double underhook suplex and tried to jump up with the move, causing him to land squarely on top of his head and suffer neck damage.[33] Garner sued the WWF, eventually settling out of court and later discussed the incident in an appearance on The Montel Williams Show.[citation needed] Levesque was known backstage as one of the members of The Kliq, a stable of wrestlers including; Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, Sean Waltman and Scott Hall, who were known for influencing Vince McMahon and the WWF creative team.[29] It has been claimed that he was scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring tournament, but the victory was instead awarded to Stone Cold Steve Austin after the Madison Square Garden Incident, in which the Kliq broke character after a match to say goodbye to the departing Nash and Hall.[34] Despite the punishment, Helmsley did have success following the MSG Incident. Mr. Perfect became his manager and he won the Intercontinental Championship for the first time on October 21, 1996, defeating Marc Mero.[32][34] When Mr. Perfect left the WWF, his departure was explained to be a result of Helmsley turning his back on his manager as soon as he won the Intercontinental Championship. Helmsley held the title for nearly four months before dropping it to Rocky Maivia on the February 13, 1997 special episode of Monday Night Raw, called Thursday Raw Thursday.[35] For a very brief time, Helmsley was accompanied by Mr. Hughes, who was his storyline bodyguard reminiscent of Ted DiBiase and Virgil.[36] After losing the Intercontinental title, he feuded with Goldust, defeating him at WrestleMania 13.[37] During their feud, Chyna debuted as his new bodyguard.[38] Helmsley was being highlighted again in 1997, winning the 1997 King of the Ring tournament by defeating Mankind in the finals.[34][39] Later that year, Shawn Michaels, Helmsley, Chyna and Rick Rude formed D-Generation X (DX). This stable became known for pushing the envelope, as Michaels and Helmsley made risqu\u00e9 promos\u2014using the catchphrase \"Suck It\" and a \"crotch chop\" hand motion[40]\u2014and sarcastically derided Bret Hart and Canada. By that point, Helmsley had all but dropped the \"blueblood snob\" gimmick, appearing in T-shirts and leather jackets. During this period, his ring name was shortened to simply Triple H, even though he would still be referred for a while as Helmsley from time to time and Hunter for the rest of his career.[34] Even after the DX versus Hart Foundation storyline ended, he continued to feud with the sole remaining Hart family member Owen over the European Championship. This ended in a match between the two at WrestleMania XIV, with the stipulation that Chyna had to be handcuffed to then-Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter. Triple H won after Chyna threw powder into Slaughter's eyes, momentarily \"blinding\" him and allowing her to interfere in the match.[citation needed] After WrestleMania, Michaels was forced into temporary retirement due to a legitimate back injury sustained at the Royal Rumble,[41] with Triple H taking over the leadership position in DX,[34] claiming that his now-former associate had \"dropped the ball\". He introduced the returning X-Pac the night after WrestleMania and joined forces with The New Age Outlaws.[34][42] As 1998 went along, DX became more popular, turning the group from villains to fan favorites. During this time, he adopted an entrance gimmick of asking the crowd \"Are you ready? I said, are you ready?\", followed by a parody of rival promotion WCW's ring announcer Michael Buffer's famous catch-phrase, \"Let's get ready to rumble\", substituting the word \"rumble\" with the DX slogan, \"suck it\". Also during this time, Triple H began a feud with the leader of the Nation of Domination and rising WWF villain, The Rock.[18] This storyline rivalry eventually led to a feud over the Intercontinental Championship, which Triple H won in a ladder match at SummerSlam.[18] He did not hold the title long, however, as he was sidelined with a legitimate knee injury.[18] When The Rock won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series,[43] the rivalry between the two continued, as DX fought The Corporation stable of which The Rock was the main star and Triple H received a shot at the WWF Championship on the January 25, 1999 Raw Is War in an \"I Quit\" match, but the match ended when Triple H was forced to quit or see his aide Chyna chokeslammed by Kane.[18] This began a new angle for Triple H, as Chyna betrayed him by attacking him after the match and joining The Corporation.[18] At WrestleMania XV, Triple H lost to Kane after Chyna interfered on his behalf and she was thought to have rejoined DX.[18] Later on in the night, he betrayed his long-time friend and fellow DX member X-Pac by helping Shane McMahon retain the European Championship and joined The Corporation.[18] turning heel in the process. In April, he started to move away from his DX look, taping his fists for matches, sporting new and shorter wrestling trunks and adopting a shorter hairstyle.[18] His gimmick changed as he fought to earn a WWF Championship opportunity.[18] After failed attempts at winning the championship, Triple H and Mankind challenged then WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin to a triple threat match at SummerSlam, which featured Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura as the special guest referee. Mankind won the match by pinning Austin.[44] The following night on Raw Is War, Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF Championship.[18] He dropped the WWF Championship to Mr. McMahon on the September 16, 1999 episode of SmackDown! before regaining it at Unforgiven in a Six-Pack Challenge that included Davey Boy Smith, Big Show, Kane, The Rock and Mankind. He defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin at No Mercy before dropping the title to Big Show at Survivor Series. Triple H then continued his feud with Mr. McMahon by marrying his daughter Stephanie McMahon and defeating McMahon at Armageddon. As a result of the feud, an angle with Triple H and Stephanie began which carried the WWF throughout the next seventeen months; together they were known as The McMahon-Helmsley Faction.[45] By January 2000, Triple H had dubbed himself \"The Game\", implying that he was on top of the wrestling world (as in not merely the \"best in the game\", but that he was in fact \"the game\") and was nicknamed \"The Cerebral Assassin\" by Jim Ross. On the January 3 episode of Raw Is War, Triple H defeated Big Show to win his third WWF championship.[46] Triple H feuded with Mick Foley in early 2000. They both fought at the Royal Rumble in a Street Fight Match for the WWF Championship, which Triple H won after performing two Pedigrees on Foley. The feud ended at No Way Out in a Hell in a Cell, where Triple H retained the title and forced Foley to retire.[47] Triple H pinned The Rock at WrestleMania 2000 to retain the title,[48] but lost it at Backlash to The Rock, thus ending his reign at 118 days.[49] He regained it three weeks later, in an Iron Man match at Judgment Day,[50] only to lose it back to The Rock at King of the Ring.[51] Triple H then entered a storyline with Chris Jericho, who upset Triple H by defeating him for the WWF Championship on the April 17 episode of Raw Is War before the title was returned to Triple H because of a fast count made by referee Earl Hebner, and Jericho's reign is not being recognized.[52] Their feud culminated in a Last Man Standing match at Fully Loaded which was won by Triple H.[53] Afterwards, Triple H entered a feud with Kurt Angle, initially over the WWF Championship, but then as a love triangle between himself, Angle, and Stephanie.[54] Both Triple H and Angle wrestled for the WWF Championship against The Rock at SummerSlam, but The Rock retained the title after Angle received a legit concussion during a botched Pedigree on a commentary table by Triple H.[55][56] The feud culminated at Unforgiven, where Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree after a low blow from McMahon.[51] After a brief run as a face that saw him defeating Chris Benoit at No Mercy,[57][58] Triple H reverted to his heel persona and restarted his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when it emerged that Triple H had paid off Rikishi to run down Austin at Survivor Series, causing him to take a year off.[59] While in the storyline Triple H said he had done it in order to shield Austin from the WWF Championship and end his career, in reality Austin's previous neck injuries started bothering him again, forcing him to have surgery. In November 2000, Triple H and Austin had a match at Survivor Series that ended when Triple H tried to trick Austin into coming into the parking lot to run him over again, only to have Austin lift his car up with a forklift and flip the car onto its roof 10\u00a0feet high.[60][61] Triple H returned a few weeks later to attack Austin, and their feud continued into 2001 and ended in a Three Stages of Hell match in which Triple H defeated Austin.[62] In 2001, Triple H also feuded with The Undertaker, who defeated him at WrestleMania X-Seven.[63] The night after WrestleMania, Triple H interfered in a steel cage match between Austin (who had just won the WWF Championship) and The Rock where he joined forces with Austin and double teamed on The Rock,[64] forming a tag team called The Two-Man Power Trip. Triple H then defeated Chris Jericho for his third Intercontinental Championship on the April 5 SmackDown!,[65] and won it for a fourth time two weeks later by defeating Jeff Hardy.[66] Triple H then became a world tag team champion by winning the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time at Backlash when he and Austin defeated Kane and The Undertaker in a \"Winner Take All\" tag team match. As Triple H was still Intercontinental Champion, the win made him a double champion. In doing so, Triple H became the 7th Triple Crown winner and 2nd Grand Slam winner in WWE history.[67] During the May 21, 2001 episode of Raw Is War, he suffered a legitimate and career-threatening injury.[7][68] In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, he suffered a tear in his left quadriceps muscle,[7][68] causing it to come completely off the bone.[16] Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match.[16] He even allowed Jericho to put him in the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months,[7][16] completely missing The Invasion storyline. Triple H returned to Raw as a face on January 7, 2002 at Madison Square Garden.[16] He won the Royal Rumble and received an Undisputed WWF Championship match at WrestleMania X8,[69] where Triple H defeated Chris Jericho for the Undisputed WWF Championship.[7][69] After holding the title for a month, Triple H dropped it to Hulk Hogan at Backlash.[69] Triple H then became exclusive to the SmackDown! roster due to the WWF draft lottery and continued to feud with Jericho, culminating in a Hell in a Cell match at Judgment Day, which Triple H won. On the June 6, 2002 episode of SmackDown!, Triple H defeated Hogan in a #1 contender match for the Undisputed WWE Championship at the King of the Ring against The Undertaker, but was unsuccessful at the event.[citation needed] In the interim, between the Royal Rumble and WrestleMania, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction was brought to an official on-screen conclusion. By the time he returned, Triple H's on-screen marriage to Stephanie McMahon was faltering, so Stephanie faked a pregnancy in order to get him back on her side.[70] When he learned that it was fake, he dumped her publicly on Raw when they were supposed to renew their wedding vows.[70] Stephanie aligned with Jericho afterward,[70] but she was forced to leave after losing a triple threat match on Raw the night after WrestleMania when she was pinned by Triple H.[71] The divorce, and thus the storyline, was finalized at Vengeance.[72] Meanwhile, Shawn Michaels had made his return to WWE and joined the New World Order (nWo). Michaels and Kevin Nash planned to bring Triple H over to Raw in order to put him into the group. Mr. McMahon, however, disbanded the nWo following several backstage complications and brought in Eric Bischoff as the Raw general manager. One of Bischoff's first intentions was to follow up on the nWo's plan and bring Triple H over to the Raw roster. Triple H went to the Raw brand, reuniting with Michaels, but on July 22 he turned on Michaels by performing a Pedigree on him during what was supposed to be a DX reunion, turning heel once again. The following week, Triple H smashed Michaels' face into a car window to prove that Michaels was weak. These events led to the beginning of a long storyline rivalry between the former partners and an eventual \"Unsanctioned Street Fight\" at SummerSlam, in which Michaels came out of retirement to win. Afterwards, however, Triple H attacked him with a sledgehammer and Michaels was carried out of the ring.[73] Before September 2, 2002, WWE recognized only one world champion, the WWE Undisputed Champion, for both the Raw and SmackDown! brands. After SummerSlam, then WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown!, leaving Raw without a world champion. Raw general manager Eric Bischoff then awarded Triple H the World Heavyweight Championship, represented by the Big Gold Belt (which previously had been used to represent the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Heavyweight Championship), making him the first World Heavyweight Champion.[74] Triple H retained his title against Rob Van Dam at Unforgiven when Ric Flair hit Van Dam with a sledgehammer. In October 2002, Triple H would begin a controversial feud with Kane, leading to a match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. In the weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick.[75] He went on to claim that, after Vick was killed in a car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse.[75] Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a casket;[75] Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans,[76] and was de-emphasized before the title match. Triple H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy, unifying the two titles.[77] Triple H eventually lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Shawn Michaels in the first Elimination Chamber match at Survivor Series.[78] He defeated Van Dam to earn a title shot at Armageddon with Michaels as the special guest referee. He regained the title from Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell match at Armageddon.[78] In February 2003, Triple H formed a stable known as Evolution with Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista. Triple H and Flair challenged Rob Van Dam and Kane for the World Tag Team Championship, but they lost the match. The group was pushed on Raw from 2003 to 2004 and the height of their dominance occurred after Armageddon, where every member of Evolution left the pay-per-view holding a title.[79] Triple H held the World Heavyweight Championship for most of 2003, successfully defending against Booker T at WrestleMania XIX in an angle with racist undertones.[80] He lost the title after 280 days in September 2003 at Unforgiven to Goldberg, in a match with the stipulation that had Goldberg lost, he would have to retire.[81] After a failing to win back the title from Goldberg in a rematch at Survivor Series, he finally regained the championship from Goldberg in a triple threat match at Armageddon which also involved Kane after interference from Evolution. On the December 29 episode of Raw, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels, but the match ended in a double pinfall. The two met in a Last Man Standing rematch at the 2004 Royal Rumble, where both failed to answer the ten count, so Triple H retained the title as a result.[79] Triple H lost the championship to Chris Benoit at WrestleMania XX in a triple threat match also involving Michaels.[82] Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown! brand on March 22 episode of Raw and failed to capture the WWE Championship from Eddie Guerrero.[83] Triple H was drafted back to Raw without competing on SmackDown! and tried to reclaim the World Heavyweight title from Benoit in a WrestleMania rematch against Benoit and Michaels at Backlash, but came out unsuccessful.[82] He then ended his feud with Michaels, defeating him in a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood, which became the longest Hell in a Cell match in history.[82] He then resumed his feud with Benoit, facing him for the title at Vengeance and on the July 26 episode of Raw in a 60-Minute Iron Man match, losing both times after Eugene interfered and hit him with a steel chair. He went on to defeat Eugene at SummerSlam.[84] The following night on Raw, Triple H turned on his prot\u00e8ge Randy Orton (who became the youngest world champion in WWE history the night prior at SummerSlam), expressing jealousy over Orton's title victory. He then regained the championship from Orton at Unforgiven after interference from Evolution. At Taboo Tuesday, Shawn Michaels was voted by the fans to challenge Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship, but Triple H retained after Edge interfered. He then led a team of himself, Batista, Edge, and Snitsky against Orton's team of Orton, Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven at Survivor Series in a traditional elimination tag team match, which they lost after Triple H was lastly eliminated by Orton.[85] After a triple threat World Heavyweight title defense against Benoit and Edge on the November 29, 2004 episode of Raw ended in a draw, the World Heavyweight Championship became vacant for the first time.[86] At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won an Elimination Chamber match to regain the World Heavyweight Championship after last eliminating Orton following interference Evolution, then defeated Orton at the Royal Rumble to retain the title and end their feud. Also that same night, his stablemate Batista won the 2005 Royal Rumble match, thus earning a world title match at WrestleMania 21. Tension between Triple H and Batista began in the weeks leading up to the pay-per view as Triple H tried to convince Batista to challenge for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania instead of his World Heavyweight Championship. On the February 21 episode of Raw, Batista turned on Triple H and signed a contract to face him for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania.[87] At the event, Triple H lost the championship to Batista,[88] and subsequently lost two rematches at Backlash and Vengeance in a Hell in a Cell match (where Batista became the first man to pin Triple H inside the Cell).[89][90] After Vengeance, Triple H took a hiatus from WWE due to suffering from minor neck problems.[91] After a four-month hiatus, Triple H returned to Raw on October 3, 2005 as part of WWE Homecoming. He teamed with fellow Evolution member Flair to defeat Chris Masters and Carlito. After the match, Triple H turned on Flair hitting Flair with a sledgehammer, sparking a feud between the duo.[92] Flair defeated Triple H in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday for Flair's Intercontinental Championship.[93] Subsequently, Triple H defeated Flair in a non-title Last Man Standing match at Survivor Series to end their feud.[93] By this time Triple H started to act like a tweener, as he began to get cheers by live audience. Although Triple H failed to win the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, another championship opportunity arose for him in the Road to WrestleMania Tournament. He won the tournament, granting him a match for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 22, where Triple H and John Cena fought in the main event for the title, which Triple H lost via submission. In this match Cena was booed by the crowd, while Triple H got heavily cheered.[94] Later that month at Backlash, Triple H was involved in another WWE Championship match, fighting Edge and Cena in a triple threat match, where he lost again. Angered at his loss, a bloodied Triple H used his sledgehammer to attack both Edge and Cena and then performed a number of DX crotch chops.[95] Triple H unsuccessfully attempted to win the WWE title from Cena on numerous occasions, blaming his shortcomings on Vince McMahon, which eventually led to a feud between the McMahons and Triple H.[citation needed] Shawn Michaels returned on the June 12 episode of Raw and soon reunited with Triple H to re-form D-Generation X, turning Triple H into a fan favorite once again for the first time since mid-2002.[8] DX defeated The Spirit Squad at Vengeance in a 5-on-2 handicap match.[96] They continued their feud with Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon and The Spirit Squad for several weeks. They then defeated The Spirit Squad again on the July 15, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII in a 5-on-2 elimination match. They then again defeated the McMahons at SummerSlam, withstanding the attack of several wrestlers who assaulted them before the match as directed by Mr. McMahon.[95] At Unforgiven, D-Generation X then defeated the McMahons and ECW World Champion Big Show in a 3-on-2 handicap Hell in a Cell match. During the match, DX embarrassed Vince by shoving his face in between Big Show's buttocks, and DX won when Triple H broke a sledgehammer over the shoulders of Mr. McMahon after Michaels performed a Sweet Chin Music on him.[97] At Cyber Sunday during DX's feud with Rated-RKO, special guest referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal use of a weapon to give Rated-RKO the win.[97] At Survivor Series, DX got their revenge when their team defeated Edge and Orton's team in a clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match.[98] In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match.[99][100] Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.[99] Triple H made his return at SummerSlam, where he defeated King Booker.[101] Two months later at No Mercy, Triple H was originally scheduled to face Umaga in a singles match. However, at the start of the night, Triple H decided to challenge newly named WWE Champion Randy Orton, reigniting his rivalry with Orton that had been interrupted following his injury. Triple H won the match, winning his eleventh world championship and sixth WWE Championship,[102] and then defended his title against Umaga in his regularly scheduled match after Mr. McMahon declared the match to be for the WWE title.[103] After that McMahon gave Orton a rematch against Triple H in a Last Man Standing match in the main event, and Triple H lost after an RKO on a broadcast table.[103] Triple H's title reign at No Mercy is the fifth shortest reign in WWE history, only lasting through the duration of the event.[103] After winning the Raw Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out, Triple H gained a WWE Championship match by outlasting five other men, last eliminating Jeff Hardy after a Pedigree on a steel chair.[104] However, at WrestleMania XXIV, Orton retained after punting Triple H and pinning John Cena following Triple H's Pedigree on Cena.[105] A month later, at Backlash, Triple H won the title in a fatal four-way elimination match against Orton, Cena, and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, tying the record for most WWE Championship reigns with The Rock.[106] Triple H then retained the title against Orton at Judgment Day in a steel cage match and again at One Night Stand in a Last Man Standing match.[107][108] Orton suffered a legitimate collarbone injury during the match, thus ending the feud prematurely.[109] Triple H then went on to defeat cleanly John Cena to successfully defend the WWE Championship at Night of Champions.[110] On the June 23 episode of Raw, Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand as a part of the 2008 WWE draft, in the process making the WWE Championship exclusive to SmackDown.[111] He defended the championship over the summer by defeating the likes of Edge at The Great American Bash[112] and The Great Khali at SummerSlam,[113] and was the only champion to retain his title at Unforgiven's Championship Scramble matches.[114] After this, he successfully defended it against Jeff Hardy both at No Mercy[115] and Cyber Sunday.[116] At Survivor Series, Triple H was scheduled to defend the championship against Vladimir Kozlov and Jeff Hardy, but Hardy was kept out of the match after a scripted attack and injury. During the match, SmackDown general manager Vickie Guerrero announced that Edge had returned and introduced him into the contest. Hardy interfered and hit Triple H with a steel chair meant for Edge, thus costing him the title after a 210 days reign and resulting in Edge winning his sixth world title.[117] After failing to regain the title at Armageddon,[118] Triple H entered seventh in the 2009 Royal Rumble, but was last eliminated by Randy Orton.[119] In February at No Way Out, Triple H won the WWE Championship in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, setting the record for most reigns at eight.[120] That record stood until 2011 when John Cena won his ninth WWE Championship. On the February 16 episode of Raw, Triple H made an appearance aiding Stephanie and Shane McMahon, after they were attacked by Randy Orton.[121] On the February 20 episode of SmackDown, Triple H was interviewed by Jim Ross; in the interview, footage was shown highlighting the events that occurred on the February 16 episode of Raw. Ross asked Triple H how he felt seeing that footage, in response, he broke character (after 5 years of marriage) by admitting that Vince McMahon is his father-in-law, that Shane is his brother-in-law, and that Stephanie is his wife, thus creating a rivalry between Triple H and Orton. On the February 23 episode of Raw, Triple H confronted Orton, before attacking him, Ted DiBiase, and Cody Rhodes (a group known as The Legacy) with a sledgehammer and chasing them from the arena.[122] At WrestleMania XXV, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the title. He teamed with Shane McMahon and Batista against Orton and The Legacy in a six-man tag match for the WWE Championship at Backlash, which they lost after Orton pinned Triple H following a Punt Kick. After six weeks off of TV, selling the injury, he lost a Three Stages of Hell title match to Orton at The Bash. At Night of Champions, he again lost a title match to Orton in a triple threat match also involving John Cena.[citation needed] On the August 10 episode of Raw, Triple H met with Michaels at an office cafeteria in Texas where Michaels was working as a chef; throughout the show, Triple H tried to convince Michaels to return to WWE from hiatus. After several incidents (including grease grill burgers on fire and Michaels shouting at a little girl), Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy at SummerSlam, superkicked the girl, and quit his chef job.[123] On the August 17 episode of Raw, Triple H and Michaels officially reunited as DX, but as they were in the process of their in-ring promo, The Legacy attacked them both.[124] Their first match after reuniting was against The Legacy at SummerSlam, which they won.[125] At Breaking Point, however, they lost to The Legacy in the first ever Submissions Count Anywhere match in WWE history.[126] At Hell in a Cell, DX defeated The Legacy in a Hell in a Cell match.[127] DX unsuccessfully challenged John Cena for the WWE Championship in a triple threat match at Survivor Series,[128] after which they remained friends and partners. On December 13 at TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs, DX defeated Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and Big Show) to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.[129] This was their first tag team championship reign together. On December 21, Triple H announced that Hornswoggle was the new DX mascot.[130] This came about after Hornswoggle sued DX for emotional and physical distress due to them not allowing him to join DX.[130] After being taken to court where they were ruled guilty by a jury and judge consisting of dwarves, Michaels told Triple H that Hornswoggle could be the mascot. Triple H agreed to it only if the charges were dropped, which Hornswoggle agreed to.[130] On January 11, 2010 episode of Raw, Mike Tyson, who was the Raw guest host for the night, teamed with Jericho to face DX; however, at the end of the bout, Tyson turned on Jericho and aligned himself with Triple H and Michaels.[131] On the February 8 episode of Raw, DX lost the Unified Tag Team Championship to ShoMiz (The Miz and Big Show) in a triple threat elimination tag match, also involving The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). On the March 1 episode of Raw, they lost a rematch for the title. This was their last televised match before Michaels retired.[132] Michaels and Triple H had a non-wrestling reunion at the 2010 Tribute to the Troops. On February 21, Triple H eliminated then WWE Champion Sheamus from the Elimination Chamber match, though he did not win the title himself. Sheamus attacked him weeks later, setting up a match at WrestleMania XXVI, which Triple H won.[133][134] Also at WrestleMania, Michaels lost to The Undertaker and was forced to retire. While giving a farewell speech the next night, Sheamus attacked him and set up a rematch at Extreme Rules. Sheamus attacked Triple H at the start of the show, before later winning the match. Triple H then took time off to recover from injuries.[135] Triple H made an untelevized appearance on October 30 at the WWE Fan Appreciation Event and also at the 2010 Tribute to the Troops.[136] On the February 21, 2011 episode of Raw, Triple H returned, interrupting the return of The Undertaker and challenging him to a match at WrestleMania XXVII, which later became a No Holds Barred match. A week later, he attacked Sheamus with a Pedigree through a broadcast table in retaliation for Sheamus giving him a ten-month injury. At WrestleMania XXVII, Triple H lost, which extended Undertaker's undefeated streak to 19\u20130; Undertaker was carried from the ring on a stretcher whereas Triple H left on his own accord.[137] At the end of the July 18 episode of Raw, Triple H returned on behalf of WWE's board of directors to relieve his father-in-law Vince McMahon of his duties.[138] This was followed by the announcement that he had been assigned to take over as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the WWE. This was during a storyline where CM Punk had won the WWE Championship and left the company. Though a new champion was crowned, Triple H helped re-sign Punk and upheld both championship reigns. He announced he would referee a match to unify both WWE Championships at SummerSlam. Although he counted a pinfall for CM Punk to win, John Cena's leg was on the ropes, which would break the pin. Regardless, Triple H's longtime friend Kevin Nash attacked Punk immediately after the match to allow Alberto Del Rio to become the new champion.[139] Though Nash and Punk demanded a match against each other, Triple H fired Nash for insubordination and booked himself in a No Disqualification match at Night of Champions with his position of COO on the line.[140] He won the match despite interference from John Laurinaitis, Nash, The Miz and R-Truth.[141] After repeated attacks from these wrestlers in various matches, the majority of WWE's on-screen staff gave Triple H a vote of no confidence. Mr. McMahon returned to relieve him of his duties on Raw, though he remained the COO. He was replaced as general manager of Raw by Laurinaitis, who booked him in a tag team match against Miz and R-Truth at Vengeance.[142] During the match, Nash once again attacked him and did so the following night on the October 24 episode of Raw, hospitalizing him (kayfabe).[143] WWE later announced that Triple H had sustained a fractured vertebra, and would be out of action. He returned on December 12, as part of the Slammy Awards. On December 18, he defeated Nash at Tables, Ladders, and Chairs in sledgehammer ladder match, after attacking him with a sledgehammer.[144] Triple H returned on the January 30, 2012 episode of Raw to evaluate Laurinaitis' performance as general manager. Before he could announce the decision, he was interrupted by the returning Undertaker.[145] After initially refusing the rematch as he did not want to tarnish The Undertaker's legacy,[146] Triple H accepted the challenge after being called a coward who lives in Shawn Michaels' shadow, on the condition their rematch be contested inside Hell in a Cell.[147] Triple H went on to lose this match at WrestleMania XXVIII.[148] Triple H returned on the April 30 episode of Raw, when he refused to give in to Brock Lesnar's unreasonable contract demands, resulting in Lesnar attacking him and storyline breaking his arm.[149][150] Upon his return two weeks later, Triple H was confronted by Lesnar's legal representative, Paul Heyman, who announced Lesnar was filing a lawsuit against WWE for breach of contract. After he accosted Heyman, Heyman threatened another lawsuit against Triple H for assault and battery.[151] At the No Way Out in June, Triple H challenged Lesnar, who was not present, to a match at SummerSlam,[152] which Heyman refused on Lesnar's behalf the following night on Raw.[153] At Raw 1000, Stephanie McMahon goaded Heyman into Triple H's challenge against Lesnar.[154] To anger Triple H, Lesnar broke Michaels's arm on the August 13 episode of Raw.[155] Six days later at SummerSlam, Triple H lost to Lesnar after submitting to the Kimura Lock, breaking his arm again in storyline.[156][157] On the August 27 episode of Raw, Triple H was supposed to address his potential retirement, but did not make a definitive decision.[158] On the December 17 episode of Raw, Triple H made a non-wrestling appearance for the 2012 Slammy Awards debuting with his new haircut. Triple H returned on the February 25, 2013 episode of Raw, brawling with Brock Lesnar after he attempted to attack Mr. McMahon. The brawl resulted in Lesnar having his head split open and requiring 18 stitches.[159] The following week, Triple H issued a challenge to Lesnar, requesting a rematch with him at WrestleMania 29, which Lesnar accepted on the condition that he could choose the stipulation.[160][161] The following week, after Triple H signed the contract and assaulted Heyman, the stipulation was revealed as No Holds Barred with Triple H's career on the line.[162] At WrestleMania, Triple H defeated Lesnar after a Pedigree onto the steel steps.[163] On the April 15 episode of Raw, Heyman challenged Triple H to face Lesnar in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules,[164] which Triple H accepted the following week.[165] Triple H ended up losing the match at the pay-per-view on May 19 thanks to interference from Heyman, and he also injured his jaw.[166] The next night on Raw, Triple H wrestled Heyman's newest client, Curtis Axel. He suffered a storyline concussion and was deemed to have forfeited.[167][168][169] Despite being medically cleared to wrestle before the June 3 episode of Raw, Vince and Stephanie McMahon did not allow Triple H to wrestle Axel, citing concerns for his well-being and the safety of his children. In response, Triple H stormed out the arena and vowed to return to the ring the next week on Raw.[170] On that episode, he lost to Axel when McMahon dubiously disqualified him, ordered Axel to leave the ring, then stole the bell and microphone to prevent the match from being restarted. On the August 12 episode of Raw, Triple H announced that he would be the special guest referee of the SummerSlam main event: the WWE Championship match between champion John Cena and Daniel Bryan before attacking Brad Maddox with a Pedigree. At the event, after Bryan won the match and the title, Triple H attacked Bryan with a Pedigree, allowing Randy Orton to cash in his Money in the Bank and win the title, turning heel for the first time since 2006.[171] Along with his wife Stephanie, they created The Authority, with The Shield as his enforcers and later Kane joining as the Director of Operations. Over the coming weeks he set up handicap matches against any wrestlers who questioned his decisions, such as Big Show and Dolph Ziggler, even firing Cody Rhodes in retaliation for the latter's insolence. On the October 7 episode of Raw, after \"firing\" Big Show, Show knocked him out in retaliation and was carried out by officials out of the arena.[172] At the 2013 Slammy Awards, Triple H immediately performed a Pedigree on Orton after Bryan shoved him into Stephanie McMahon, despite Orton's shock.[173] At WrestleMania XXX, Triple H lost to Bryan, thereby granting Bryan a part in the subsequent title match against Batista and champion Randy Orton. Triple H assaulted Bryan after the match and later attempted to prevent Bryan from winning the title by interfering and recruiting Scott Armstrong as a crooked referee, but these attempts were unsuccessful as Bryan won the title by making Batista submit. In order to end Bryan's title reign, Triple H re-formed Evolution with Orton and Batista on the April 18 episode of SmackDown, but Bryan remained champion due to The Shield turning on The Authority. At Extreme Rules, Evolution lost to The Shield and again at Payback in a No Holds Barred elimination match.[174] On the June 2 episode of Raw, Batista would leave the group after Triple H refused to grant him his shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H would then resort to \"Plan B\", which would be Seth Rollins turning on The Shield and rejoining The Authority. On the October 27 episode of Raw, Triple H would offer John Cena a chance to join forces with The Authority, which Cena refused. This led to Triple H announcing a five-on-five tag team elimination match for Survivor Series, with a team representing The Authority facing a team captained by Cena.[175] On the November 3 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon announced that if Team Authority would lose, they would be removed from power.[176] On the November 21 episode of SmackDown, Triple H announced that if Team Cena lost, all of Team Cena, except Cena himself, would be fired.[177] At Survivor Series, Big Show joined The Authority by betraying Cena, but Sting made his WWE debut, attacking crooked referee Scott Armstrong and Triple H, and assisted Dolph Ziggler in pinning Rollins to give Team Cena the victory, putting the Authority out of power. After being out of power for a month, Rollins coaxed Cena into reinstating The Authority on the December 29 episode of Raw, by holding Raw guest host Edge hostage with Big Show.[178] On the January 19 episode of Raw, Cena would defeat Rollins, Kane and Big Show in a handicap match when Sting distracted The Authority, allowing Cena to pin Rollins and win back the jobs of Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan, who had been fired two weeks previously by Triple H and Stephanie. On January 26, it was officially announced via WWE.com that Triple H challenged Sting to a \"face-to-face\" confrontation at Fastlane, which Sting accepted; at the confrontation, Sting challenged Triple H to a match at WrestleMania 31, which Triple H accepted.[179] At WrestleMania, Triple H defeated Sting with interference from D-Generation-X, but shook hands with Sting after the match. After his match with Sting, he and Stephanie McMahon were later confronted by The Rock and Ronda Rousey during a promo regarding the record crowd at the event.[180][181] Throughout 2015, Triple H maintained his role as the leader of The Authority, and was involved in mediating issues between Seth Rollins and Kane.[182][183] Over the summer, Triple H began to test Rollins by having him defend the championship against Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, John Cena, and Sting.[184][185][186][187] After Rollins suffered a legitimate severe knee injury at a live event, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was vacated and it was announced that there would be a tournament to determine a new champion at Survivor Series.[188][189] On the November 9 episode of Raw, Triple H offered to give Reigns a bye to the finals of the tournament if he joined The Authority, but Reigns refused.[190] At Survivor Series, Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose in the tournament finals to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H came out and attempted to congratulate Reigns, but was instead hit with a spear. This allowed Sheamus to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and quickly defeat Reigns to win the championship, resulting in Sheamus aligning with The Authority.[191] The Authority made a rematch between Reigns and Sheamus for the title on the November 30 episode of Raw, with the stipulation that Dean Ambrose and The Usos would lose their Intercontinental Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship title shots if Reigns failed to win the match in under 5 minutes and 15 seconds (which was the length Reigns' title reign at Survivor Series); Reigns won by disqualification, allowing Ambrose and The Usos to keep their title shots.[192] At TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, Sheamus retained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Reigns due to interference from The League of Nations. After the match, Reigns \"snapped\" and viciously attacked Sheamus as well as Triple H, who had come to calm Reigns. Due to the injuries (kayfabe) suffered from Reigns, Triple H took a hiatus from television.[193] Triple H returned at the 2016 Royal Rumble match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, as the unannounced 30th entrant. After eliminating the defending champion, Roman Reigns, he then eliminated Dean Ambrose to secure his second Royal Rumble win and 14th world championship overall.[194] After breaking Reigns' nose in storyline in which he received a massive ovation,[195] Triple H was then challenged by Ambrose,[196] whom he defeated at Roadblock to defend the title,[197] before dropping it back to Reigns \u2013 who had become the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Dean Ambrose and Brock Lesnar in a triple threat match at Fastlane[198] \u2013 at WrestleMania 32, ending his reign at 70 days.[199] After WrestleMania 32, with The Authority now disbanded, Triple H competed in the WWE Live tour of the United Kingdom in late April before taking a hiatus from WWE television, whilst occasionally appearing at NXT and Cruiserweight Classic events. He was present for the finales of the Cruiserweight Classic and the United Kingdom Championship Tournament, awarding the titles to T.J. Perkins[200] and Tyler Bate,[201] respectively. On the August 29 episode of Raw, Triple H made his return by interfering in the main event for the recently vacated and established WWE Universal Championship. Firstly, he attacked rival Roman Reigns with a Pedigree, allowing former Authority stable member Seth Rollins to eliminate him, before attacking Rollins with a Pedigree, allowing Kevin Owens to win the title.[202] Triple H appeared at Clash of Champions on September 25, escorting his wife Stephanie McMahon from the building, after Owens successfully defended the Universal Championship against Rollins. On the January 23, 2017 episode of Raw, in a match between Rollins and Sami Zayn, Triple H's music hit, providing the distraction which led to Zayn defeating Rollins and, in the process, stealing Rollins' place in the Royal Rumble.[203] On January 28 at NXT TakeOver: San Antonio, Rollins would \"takeover\" the show and called out Triple H, who appeared and summoned security guards to escort Rollins out of the arena.[204] On January 30, Triple H made his first appearance on Raw since August 2016, supposedly to finally accept Rollins' challenge for a match. However, he did not, labeling Rollins as an abject failure, despite all the chances he was given. He called Rollins out to come and meet his destroyer, which he does so, only for him to be jumped by Samoa Joe.[205] Rollins suffered a legitimate knee injury in the ambush, casting doubt over the potential match with Triple H,[206] which led to a non-sanctioned match at WrestleMania 33 on April 2,[207] where Triple H lost to Rollins.[208] On the November 13 episode of Raw, Triple H announced himself as the fifth member of Team Raw for Survivor Series.[209] At Survivor Series, team captain Kurt Angle was about to win the match for Raw but Triple H pedigreed Angle which also led to Angle's elimination in the match. However, later himself pinned the final member of Team Smackdown as it appeared Triple H wanted the credit for Raw's victory. After the match fellow sole survivor Braun Strowman powerslammed him twice. He was also seen hitting the video screen as he exited the stage.[210][211] Triple H appeared the following night on Raw, and Angle said that if Triple H were to ever attack him again, he would retaliate. Triple H's next appearance came at the 2018 Elimination Chamber event for the Raw contract signing of Ronda Rousey. During the segment, Triple H confirmed that there were no special stipulations in Rousey's contract, but she would have her debut match at WrestleMania 34. Before Rousey signed her contract, Kurt Angle brought up the incident from WrestleMania 31 where Rousey embarrassed The Authority and said that Triple H and Stephanie were now glad to own Rousey so they could manipulate her. This led to Rousey putting Triple H through a table and Stephanie slapped Rousey. Stephanie then retreated and Rousey signed the contract. The next night, the four had a segment to apologize and it ended with Triple H attacking Angle. The following week, Angle revealed that although Triple H and Stephanie were WWE executives, they also had contracts to compete as wrestlers. Angle reminded Triple H of his warning from after Survivor Series, and he scheduled himself and Rousey to face Triple H and Stephanie at WrestleMania 34 in a mixed tag team match. At the event, Triple H and Stephanie lost to Angle and Rousey after Stephanie submitted to Rousey's armbar. Triple H lost to John Cena at Greatest Royal Rumble event in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.[citation needed] Triple H begin to show signs of a face turn as he returned on the July 23 episode of Raw alongside Stephanie and Vince McMahon to announce the first ever all women's pay-per-view event, WWE Evolution.[212] Following the announcement, it was also announced Triple H would return to in-ring competition at WWE Super Show-Down to take on renowned nemesis, The Undertaker, one last time. On August 20, Triple H returned to Raw and spoke about how he reluctantly accepted the rematch as the last match between the two at WrestleMania XXVIII (a Hell in a Cell with Shawn Michaels as special guest referee) was billed as the \"End of an Era\". Triple H added that the tagline of this contest would be \"Last Time Ever\".[213] At the event, Triple H emerged victorious. After the match Triple H finally turned face for the first time since mid-2013, as he and Michaels showed respect for The Undertaker and Kane, as they embraced with each other. However the Undertaker and Kane would then proceed to attack them.[214] On October 8, Triple H and Shawn Michaels announced they will reunite DX, to face The Brothers of Destruction at Crown Jewel. At the event, they defeated the Brothers of Destruction, at the cost of Triple H tearing his pectoral muscles.[215] Triple H underwent successful surgery on November 8 with a timeframe for his return unknown.[216] On February 25's edition of Raw, Batista returned and attacked Ric Flair backstage as Flair was about to make an entrance for his birthday celebration and called out Triple H. On March 11's edition of Raw Batista challenged Triple H for a match at WrestleMania 35 which Triple H accepted and made it a No Holds Barred match. At the event, Triple H defeated Batista with assistance from Flair. Triple H lost to Randy Orton at Super ShowDown. On the November 1 episode of SmackDown, Triple H and Shawn Michaels commandeered an invasion with NXT wrestlers, which started with Shayna Baszler attacking SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley, Sasha Banks and Nikki Cross, followed by Matt Riddle and Keith Lee attacking Sami Zayn, Rhea Ripley and Tegan Nox defeating Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville, Tommaso Ciampa defeating The Miz, and finished with Adam Cole successfully retaining the NXT Championship against Daniel Bryan in the main-event. After the match, Triple H and the rest of the NXT roster stormed the ring and declared war on both Raw and SmackDown, and vowed to win the Survivor Series brand warfare.[217][218] Triple H's finishing move is the Pedigree, a double underhook facebuster.[219] In 2016, Fox Sports selected the Pedigree as the ninth greatest finisher in wrestling history.[220] Triple H has been named as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.[221][222] In 2011, Pro Wrestling Torch stated he was \"widely regarded as the best wrestler in North America\" by the turn of the millennium.\"[9] Triple H has been praised for his heel persona, though he has been criticized for his last years as a wrestler. After his match against Undertaker and Kane at Crown Jewel in 2018, Dave Meltzer wrote, \"When Ric (Flair) was 48, he was a lot better than Triple H.\" Wade Keller from Pro Wrestling Torch wrote, \"Hunter moves like the trees in Wizard of Oz\".[223] Jason Powell from Prowrestling.net stated, \"They need to accept their limitations, stop pretending they belong in main events, and stop acting like being in these main events isn't stealing the spotlight.\"[224] In 2010, Levesque's role as an Executive Senior Advisor was officially formalized as he was given an office at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.[225] Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011.[citation needed] In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's role within the company has been under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers view it as a way to keep him on top on-screen and to give him more television time. Levesque has spoken against this criticism and has denied all of it. Additionally, Levesque has been credited by many for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.[citation needed] As the founder of NXT since its inception in 2012, Levesque has been widely praised for helping cultivate the brand, recruiting fresh new talent, and helping guide the brand to various levels of success including sold-out shows, increased respect for women's wrestling, and international expansion.[226][227][unreliable source][228] In 2013, his title was elevated to Executive Vice-president of Talent, Live Events and Creative where he also works with WWE creative direction and storylines of WWE's programming.[229][third-party source needed] In 2013, Levesque earned a combined salary of just over $1.5 million (U.S.) from his front office job and as a wrestler. He also owns just over $1.5 million (U.S.) in WWE stock.[6] In 2014, Levesque and his wife Stephanie created the Connor's Cure cancer fund in honor of Connor \"The Crusher\" Michalek, a WWE fan who died of cancer at the age of eight.[230] What began as an on-screen storyline marriage in 2000 became a real-life romance when Levesque began dating Stephanie McMahon. They were married on October 25, 2003,[231] in Sleepy Hollow, New York. They have three daughters: Aurora Rose Levesque (born 2006),[232] Murphy Claire Levesque (born 2008),[233][234] and Vaughn Evelyn Levesque (born 2010).[235] Levesque was previously in a relationship with fellow wrestler Chyna from 1996 to 2000, but they split up over her personal issues and her disinterest in having children.[236] In late 2004, Levesque released a book titled Making the Game: Triple H's Approach to a Better Body.[237] Mostly devoted to bodybuilding advice, the book also includes some autobiographical information, memoirs, and opinions. Levesque is teetotal.[238] Levesque is a fan of the band Mot\u00f6rhead, who have performed three different entrance themes for him over his career, and was good friends with lead singer Lemmy.[239] To pay homage, Levesque sported Lemmy-inspired facial hair during a large portion of his career.[240] He attended Lemmy's funeral on January 9, 2016, and spoke about the gift of sound that Lemmy and Mot\u00f6rhead gave to him and the friendship they had over the years.[241] During an interview with ITV London in December 2015, Levesque said that he is a supporter of West Ham United FC.[242] He is close friends with NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.[243][244]",

He has been the Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative for WWE since 2013, as well as being the founder and senior producer of NXT.\nLevesque was born and raised in Nashua, New Hampshire, and began his professional wrestling career in 1992 with the International Wrestling Federation (IWF) under the ring name Terra Ryzing. In 1994, he joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he was soon repackaged as a French-Canadian aristocrat named Jean-Paul L\u00e9vesque,[5] and was later repackaged in 1995 when he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), where he became Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and later, Triple H.[7]\nIn WWF, Triple H gained industry fame after co-founding the influential D-Generation X stable, which became a major element of the \"Attitude Era\" in the 1990s. After winning his first WWF Championship in 1999, he became a fixture of the company's main event scene,[4][8] and was widely regarded as the best wrestler in North America by the turn of the millennium.[9] Triple H has headlined several major WWE pay-per-view events, closing the company's flagship annual event, WrestleMania, seven times.[a]\nTriple H has also won a number of championships in his career, being a five-time Intercontinental Champion, a three-time world tag team champion (two World Tag Team Championship reigns, and one Unified WWE Tag Team Championship reign), a two-time European Champion, and a fourteen-time world champion, making him the company's seventh Triple Crown Champion and second Grand Slam Champion. He is also a two-time Royal Rumble match winner, and a King of the Ring tournament winner.[10][11] Later in his career, Triple H gained notability for his behind-the-scenes work at WWE, founding the developmental branch NXT, and gaining praise for his business acumen in professional wrestling.[12][13]\nOutside of wrestling, Triple H has been a figure of substantial media attention due to his marriage to Stephanie McMahon, daughter of Vince and Linda McMahon, who are majority owners of WWE.[6] In 2019, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the D-Generation X stable.\nPaul Michael Levesque[14] was born in Nashua, New Hampshire,[15] on July 27, 1969.[5] He has a sister named Lynn.[16] Levesque watched his first wrestling match, involving Chief Jay Strongbow, when he was five years old. He attended Nashua South High School, where he played baseball and basketball.[17] Following his graduation in 1987, Levesque continued to enter bodybuilding competitions\u2014having taken up bodybuilding at the age of 14 because he wanted to look like the professional wrestlers he saw on television\u2014and won the 1988 Mr. Teenage New Hampshire competition at the age of 19.[18][16] While working as a manager of a gym in Nashua, he was introduced to world champion powerlifter Ted Arcidi, who was employed by WWE at the time. Eventually, after numerous attempts, Levesque persuaded Arcidi to introduce him to former wrestler Killer Kowalski, who ran a professional wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts.[citation needed]\nIn early 1992, Levesque began to train as a professional wrestler at Killer Kowalski's school in Malden.[4][17][19] His classmates included fellow future WWF wrestlers Chyna and Perry Saturn. Levesque made his professional debut on March 24, 1992 in Kowalski's promotion, the International Wrestling Federation (IWF), under the name Terra Ryzing. In the match, he defeated Tony Roy.[5] In July 1992, he defeated Mad Dog Richard to win the IWF Heavyweight Championship.[1] Levesque wrestled for various promotions on the East Coast independent circuit until 1994 and during this period he was managed by John Rodeo.[20]\nIn early 1994, Levesque signed a one-year contract with World Championship Wrestling (WCW).[16][21] In his first televised match, Levesque debuted as a villain named Terror Risin', defeating Keith Cole. His ring name was soon modified to Terra Ryzing, which he used until mid-1994, when he was renamed Jean-Paul L\u00e9vesque.[7][22] This gimmick referred to his surname's French origins and he was asked to speak with a French accent, as he could not speak French.[23] During this time, he began using his finishing maneuver, the Pedigree. L\u00e9vesque had a brief feud with Alex Wright that ended at Starrcade[7] with Wright pinning him.[24] Between late 1994 and early 1995, L\u00e9vesque briefly teamed with Lord Steven Regal, whose upper class British persona was similar to L\u00e9vesque's character.[22] However, the team was short-lived. L\u00e9vesque had previously met with Vince McMahon to discuss jumping to the World Wrestling Federation which did not result in his working for the company. However, after McMahon watched L\u00e9vesque's match at Starrcade, an employment offer was made and Levesque left for the WWF in January 1995. \nIn a modified version of his gimmick in WCW, Levesque started his WWF career as a \"Connecticut Blueblood\".[23] According to Levesque, JJ Dillion originally gave him the name of Reginald DuPont Helmsley, but Levesque asked for a name to play with the first letters and management ultimately agreed to his suggestion of Hunter Hearst Helmsley.[25] He appeared in taped vignettes, in which he talked about how to use proper etiquette, up until his wrestling debut on the April 30, 1995 episode of Wrestling Challenge defeating Buck Zumhofe.[26] Helmsley made his WWF pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam, where he defeated Bob Holly.[27] In the fall of 1995, Helmsley began a feud with the hog farmer Henry O. Godwinn, culminating in an infamous Hog Pen match at In Your House 5: Seasons Beatings, where Helmsley was victorious.[28]\nAlthough Helmsley was highly promoted in the first few months after his debut, his career stalled during 1996, starting off with a feud with Duke \"The Dumpster\" Droese following a loss during the Free for All at 1996 Royal Rumble.[29][30] Up until that event, his angle included appearing on television each week with a different female valet (which included Playboy Playmates Shae Marks and Tylyn John).[7] Sable was his valet at WrestleMania XII and after his loss to The Ultimate Warrior,[31] as part of the storyline, he took his aggressions out on her. The debuting Marc Mero \u2013 her real-life husband \u2013 came to her rescue, starting a feud between the two wrestlers.[32]\nOn June 1, 1996, Helmsley appeared on an episode of Superstars in a match against Marty Garner.[33] When he attempted to perform the Pedigree, Garner mistook the maneuver for a double underhook suplex and tried to jump up with the move, causing him to land squarely on top of his head and suffer neck damage.[33] Garner sued the WWF, eventually settling out of court and later discussed the incident in an appearance on The Montel Williams Show.[citation needed]\nLevesque was known backstage as one of the members of The Kliq, a stable of wrestlers including; Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, Sean Waltman and Scott Hall, who were known for influencing Vince McMahon and the WWF creative team.[29] It has been claimed that he was scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring tournament, but the victory was instead awarded to Stone Cold Steve Austin after the Madison Square Garden Incident, in which the Kliq broke character after a match to say goodbye to the departing Nash and Hall.[34] Despite the punishment, Helmsley did have success following the MSG Incident. Mr. Perfect became his manager and he won the Intercontinental Championship for the first time on October 21, 1996, defeating Marc Mero.[32][34] When Mr. Perfect left the WWF, his departure was explained to be a result of Helmsley turning his back on his manager as soon as he won the Intercontinental Championship. Helmsley held the title  for nearly four months before dropping it to Rocky Maivia on the February 13, 1997 special episode of Monday Night Raw, called Thursday Raw Thursday.[35] For a very brief time, Helmsley was accompanied by Mr. Hughes, who was his storyline bodyguard reminiscent of Ted DiBiase and Virgil.[36] After losing the Intercontinental title, he feuded with Goldust, defeating him at WrestleMania 13.[37] During their feud, Chyna debuted as his new bodyguard.[38]\nHelmsley was being highlighted again in 1997, winning the 1997 King of the Ring tournament by defeating Mankind in the finals.[34][39] Later that year, Shawn Michaels, Helmsley, Chyna and Rick Rude formed D-Generation X (DX). This stable became known for pushing the envelope, as Michaels and Helmsley made risqu\u00e9 promos\u2014using the catchphrase \"Suck It\" and a \"crotch chop\" hand motion[40]\u2014and sarcastically derided Bret Hart and Canada. By that point, Helmsley had all but dropped the \"blueblood snob\" gimmick, appearing in T-shirts and leather jackets. During this period, his ring name was shortened to simply Triple H, even though he would still be referred for a while as Helmsley from time to time and Hunter for the rest of his career.[34] Even after the DX versus Hart Foundation storyline ended, he continued to feud with the sole remaining Hart family member Owen over the European Championship. This ended in a match between the two at WrestleMania XIV, with the stipulation that Chyna had to be handcuffed to then-Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter. Triple H won after Chyna threw powder into Slaughter's eyes, momentarily \"blinding\" him and allowing her to interfere in the match.[citation needed]\nAfter WrestleMania, Michaels was forced into temporary retirement due to a legitimate back injury sustained at the Royal Rumble,[41] with Triple H taking over the leadership position in DX,[34] claiming that his now-former associate had \"dropped the ball\". He introduced the returning X-Pac the night after WrestleMania and joined forces with The New Age Outlaws.[34][42] As 1998 went along, DX became more popular, turning the group from villains to fan favorites. During this time, he adopted an entrance gimmick of asking the crowd \"Are you ready? I said, are you ready?\", followed by a parody of rival promotion WCW's ring announcer Michael Buffer's famous catch-phrase, \"Let's get ready to rumble\", substituting the word \"rumble\" with the DX slogan, \"suck it\". Also during this time, Triple H began a feud with the leader of the Nation of Domination and rising WWF villain, The Rock.[18] This storyline rivalry eventually led to a feud over the Intercontinental Championship, which Triple H won in a ladder match at SummerSlam.[18] He did not hold the title long, however, as he was sidelined with a legitimate knee injury.[18] When The Rock won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series,[43] the rivalry between the two continued, as DX fought The Corporation stable of which The Rock was the main star and Triple H received a shot at the WWF Championship on the January 25, 1999 Raw Is War in an \"I Quit\" match, but the match ended when Triple H was forced to quit or see his aide Chyna chokeslammed by Kane.[18] This began a new angle for Triple H, as Chyna betrayed him by attacking him after the match and joining The Corporation.[18]\nAt WrestleMania XV, Triple H lost to Kane after Chyna interfered on his behalf and she was thought to have rejoined DX.[18] Later on in the night, he betrayed his long-time friend and fellow DX member X-Pac by helping Shane McMahon retain the European Championship and joined The Corporation.[18] turning heel in the process. In April, he started to move away from his DX look, taping his fists for matches, sporting new and shorter wrestling trunks and adopting a shorter hairstyle.[18] His gimmick changed as he fought to earn a WWF Championship opportunity.[18] After failed attempts at winning the championship, Triple H and Mankind challenged then WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin to a triple threat match at SummerSlam, which featured Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura as the special guest referee. Mankind won the match by pinning Austin.[44] The following night on Raw Is War, Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF Championship.[18] He dropped the WWF Championship to Mr. McMahon on the September 16, 1999 episode of SmackDown! before regaining it at Unforgiven in a Six-Pack Challenge that included Davey Boy Smith, Big Show, Kane, The Rock and Mankind. He defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin at No Mercy before dropping the title to Big Show at Survivor Series. Triple H then continued his feud with Mr. McMahon by marrying his daughter Stephanie McMahon and defeating McMahon at Armageddon. As a result of the feud, an angle with Triple H and Stephanie began which carried the WWF throughout the next seventeen months; together they were known as The McMahon-Helmsley Faction.[45]\nBy January 2000, Triple H had dubbed himself \"The Game\", implying that he was on top of the wrestling world (as in not merely the \"best in the game\", but that he was in fact \"the game\") and was nicknamed \"The Cerebral Assassin\" by Jim Ross. On the January 3 episode of Raw Is War, Triple H defeated Big Show to win his third WWF championship.[46]\nTriple H feuded with Mick Foley in early 2000. They both fought at the Royal Rumble in a Street Fight Match for the WWF Championship, which Triple H won after performing two Pedigrees on Foley. The feud ended at No Way Out in a Hell in a Cell, where Triple H retained the title and forced Foley to retire.[47] Triple H pinned The Rock at WrestleMania 2000 to retain the title,[48] but lost it at Backlash to The Rock, thus ending his reign at 118 days.[49] He regained it three weeks later, in an Iron Man match at Judgment Day,[50] only to lose it back to The Rock at King of the Ring.[51] Triple H then entered a storyline with Chris Jericho, who upset Triple H by defeating him for the WWF Championship on the April 17 episode of Raw Is War before the title was returned to Triple H because of a fast count made by referee Earl Hebner, and Jericho's reign is not being recognized.[52] Their feud culminated in a Last Man Standing match at Fully Loaded which was won by Triple H.[53] Afterwards, Triple H entered a feud with Kurt Angle, initially over the WWF Championship, but then as a love triangle between himself, Angle, and Stephanie.[54] Both Triple H and Angle wrestled for the WWF Championship against The Rock at SummerSlam, but The Rock retained the title after Angle received a legit concussion during a botched Pedigree on a commentary table by Triple H.[55][56] The feud culminated at Unforgiven, where Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree after a low blow from McMahon.[51]\nAfter a brief run as a face that saw him defeating Chris Benoit at No Mercy,[57][58] Triple H reverted to his heel persona and restarted his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when it emerged that Triple H had paid off Rikishi to run down Austin at Survivor Series, causing him to take a year off.[59] While in the storyline Triple H said he had done it in order to shield Austin from the WWF Championship and end his career, in reality Austin's previous neck injuries started bothering him again, forcing him to have surgery. In November 2000, Triple H and Austin had a match at Survivor Series that ended when Triple H tried to trick Austin into coming into the parking lot to run him over again, only to have Austin lift his car up with a forklift and flip the car onto its roof 10\u00a0feet high.[60][61] Triple H returned a few weeks later to attack Austin, and their feud continued into 2001 and ended in a Three Stages of Hell match in which Triple H defeated Austin.[62] In 2001, Triple H also feuded with The Undertaker, who defeated him at WrestleMania X-Seven.[63] The night after WrestleMania, Triple H interfered in a steel cage match between Austin (who had just won the WWF Championship) and The Rock where he joined forces with Austin and double teamed on The Rock,[64] forming a tag team called The Two-Man Power Trip. Triple H then defeated Chris Jericho for his third Intercontinental Championship on the April 5 SmackDown!,[65] and won it for a fourth time two weeks later by defeating Jeff Hardy.[66] Triple H then became a world tag team champion by winning the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time at Backlash when he and Austin defeated Kane and The Undertaker in a \"Winner Take All\" tag team match. As Triple H was still Intercontinental Champion, the win made him a double champion.  In doing so, Triple H became the 7th Triple Crown winner and 2nd Grand Slam winner in WWE history.[67]\nDuring the May 21, 2001 episode of Raw Is War, he suffered a legitimate and career-threatening injury.[7][68] In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, he suffered a tear in his left quadriceps muscle,[7][68] causing it to come completely off the bone.[16] Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match.[16] He even allowed Jericho to put him in the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months,[7][16] completely missing The Invasion storyline.\nTriple H returned to Raw as a face on January 7, 2002 at Madison Square Garden.[16] He won the Royal Rumble and received an Undisputed WWF Championship match at WrestleMania X8,[69] where Triple H defeated Chris Jericho for the Undisputed WWF Championship.[7][69] After holding the title for a month, Triple H dropped it to Hulk Hogan at Backlash.[69] Triple H then became exclusive to the SmackDown! roster due to the WWF draft lottery and continued to feud with Jericho, culminating in a Hell in a Cell match at Judgment Day, which Triple H won. On the June 6, 2002 episode of SmackDown!, Triple H defeated Hogan in a #1 contender match for the Undisputed WWE Championship at the King of the Ring against The Undertaker, but was unsuccessful at the event.[citation needed]\nIn the interim, between the Royal Rumble and WrestleMania, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction was brought to an official on-screen conclusion. By the time he returned, Triple H's on-screen marriage to Stephanie McMahon was faltering, so Stephanie faked a pregnancy in order to get him back on her side.[70] When he learned that it was fake, he dumped her publicly on Raw when they were supposed to renew their wedding vows.[70] Stephanie aligned with Jericho afterward,[70] but she was forced to leave after losing a triple threat match on Raw the night after WrestleMania when she was pinned by Triple H.[71] The divorce, and thus the storyline, was finalized at Vengeance.[72]\nMeanwhile, Shawn Michaels had made his return to WWE and joined the New World Order (nWo). Michaels and Kevin Nash planned to bring Triple H over to Raw in order to put him into the group. Mr. McMahon, however, disbanded the nWo following several backstage complications and brought in Eric Bischoff as the Raw general manager. One of Bischoff's first intentions was to follow up on the nWo's plan and bring Triple H over to the Raw roster. Triple H went to the Raw brand, reuniting with Michaels, but on July 22 he turned on Michaels by performing a Pedigree on him during what was supposed to be a DX reunion, turning heel once again. The following week, Triple H smashed Michaels' face into a car window to prove that Michaels was weak. These events led to the beginning of a long storyline rivalry between the former partners and an eventual \"Unsanctioned Street Fight\" at SummerSlam, in which Michaels came out of retirement to win. Afterwards, however, Triple H attacked him with a sledgehammer and Michaels was carried out of the ring.[73]\nBefore September 2, 2002, WWE recognized only one world champion, the WWE Undisputed Champion, for both the Raw and SmackDown! brands. After SummerSlam, then WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown!, leaving Raw without a world champion. Raw general manager Eric Bischoff then awarded Triple H the World Heavyweight Championship, represented by the Big Gold Belt (which previously had been used to represent the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Heavyweight Championship), making him the first World Heavyweight Champion.[74] Triple H retained his title against Rob Van Dam at Unforgiven when Ric Flair hit Van Dam with a sledgehammer.\nIn October 2002, Triple H would begin a controversial feud with Kane, leading to a match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. In the weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick.[75] He went on to claim that, after Vick was killed in a car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse.[75] Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a casket;[75] Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans,[76] and was de-emphasized before the title match. Triple H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy, unifying the two titles.[77]\nTriple H eventually lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Shawn Michaels in the first Elimination Chamber match at Survivor Series.[78] He defeated Van Dam to earn a title shot at Armageddon with Michaels as the special guest referee. He regained the title from Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell match at Armageddon.[78]\nIn February 2003, Triple H formed a stable known as Evolution with Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista. Triple H and Flair challenged Rob Van Dam and Kane for the World Tag Team Championship, but they lost the match. The group was pushed on Raw from 2003 to 2004 and the height of their dominance occurred after Armageddon, where every member of Evolution left the pay-per-view holding a title.[79] Triple H held the World Heavyweight Championship for most of 2003, successfully defending against Booker T at WrestleMania XIX in an angle with racist undertones.[80] He lost the title after 280 days in September 2003 at Unforgiven to Goldberg, in a match with the stipulation that had Goldberg lost, he would have to retire.[81] After a failing to win back the title from Goldberg in a rematch at Survivor Series, he finally regained the championship from Goldberg in a triple threat match at Armageddon which also involved Kane after interference from Evolution. On the December 29 episode of Raw, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels, but the match ended in a double pinfall. The two met in a Last Man Standing rematch at the 2004 Royal Rumble, where both failed to answer the ten count, so Triple H retained the title as a result.[79] Triple H lost the championship to Chris Benoit at WrestleMania XX in a triple threat match also involving Michaels.[82] Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown! brand on March 22 episode of Raw and failed to capture the WWE Championship from Eddie Guerrero.[83] Triple H was drafted back to Raw without competing on SmackDown! and tried to reclaim the World Heavyweight title from Benoit in a WrestleMania rematch against Benoit and Michaels at Backlash, but came out unsuccessful.[82]\nHe then ended his feud with Michaels, defeating him in a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood, which became the longest Hell in a Cell match in history.[82] He then resumed his feud with Benoit, facing him for the title at Vengeance and on the July 26 episode of Raw in a 60-Minute Iron Man match, losing both times after Eugene interfered and hit him with a steel chair. He went on to defeat Eugene at SummerSlam.[84] The following night on Raw, Triple H turned on his prot\u00e8ge Randy Orton (who became the youngest world champion in WWE history the night prior at SummerSlam), expressing jealousy over Orton's title victory. He then regained the championship from Orton at Unforgiven after interference from Evolution. At Taboo Tuesday, Shawn Michaels was voted by the fans to challenge Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship, but Triple H retained after Edge interfered. He then led a team of himself, Batista, Edge, and Snitsky against Orton's team of Orton, Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven at Survivor Series in a traditional elimination tag team match, which they lost after Triple H was lastly eliminated by Orton.[85] After a triple threat World Heavyweight title defense against Benoit and Edge on the November 29, 2004 episode of Raw ended in a draw, the World Heavyweight Championship became vacant for the first time.[86] At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won an Elimination Chamber match to regain the World Heavyweight Championship after last eliminating Orton following interference Evolution, then defeated Orton at the Royal Rumble to retain the title and end their feud. Also that same night, his stablemate Batista won the 2005 Royal Rumble match, thus earning a world title match at WrestleMania 21. Tension between Triple H and Batista began in the weeks leading up to the pay-per view as Triple H tried to convince Batista to challenge for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania instead of his World Heavyweight Championship. On the February 21 episode of Raw, Batista turned on Triple H and signed a contract to face him for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania.[87] At the event, Triple H lost the championship to Batista,[88] and subsequently lost two rematches at Backlash and Vengeance in a Hell in a Cell match (where Batista became the first man to pin Triple H inside the Cell).[89][90] After Vengeance, Triple H took a hiatus from WWE due to suffering from minor neck problems.[91]\nAfter a four-month hiatus, Triple H returned to Raw on October 3, 2005 as part of WWE Homecoming. He teamed with fellow Evolution member Flair to defeat Chris Masters and Carlito. After the match, Triple H turned on Flair hitting Flair with a sledgehammer, sparking a feud between the duo.[92] Flair defeated Triple H in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday for Flair's Intercontinental Championship.[93] Subsequently, Triple H defeated Flair in a non-title Last Man Standing match at Survivor Series to end their feud.[93]\nBy this time Triple H started to act like a tweener, as he began to get cheers by live audience. Although Triple H failed to win the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, another championship opportunity arose for him in the Road to WrestleMania Tournament. He won the tournament, granting him a match for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 22, where Triple H and John Cena fought in the main event for the title, which Triple H lost via submission. In this match Cena was booed by the crowd, while Triple H got heavily cheered.[94] Later that month at Backlash, Triple H was involved in another WWE Championship match, fighting Edge and Cena in a triple threat match, where he lost again. Angered at his loss, a bloodied Triple H used his sledgehammer to attack both Edge and Cena and then performed a number of DX crotch chops.[95] Triple H unsuccessfully attempted to win the WWE title from Cena on numerous occasions, blaming his shortcomings on Vince McMahon, which eventually led to a feud between the McMahons and Triple H.[citation needed]\nShawn Michaels returned on the June 12 episode of Raw and soon reunited with Triple H to re-form D-Generation X, turning Triple H into a fan favorite once again for the first time since mid-2002.[8] DX defeated The Spirit Squad at Vengeance in a 5-on-2 handicap match.[96] They continued their feud with Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon and The Spirit Squad for several weeks. They then defeated The Spirit Squad again on the July 15, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII in a 5-on-2 elimination match. They then again defeated the McMahons at SummerSlam, withstanding the attack of several wrestlers who assaulted them before the match as directed by Mr. McMahon.[95] At Unforgiven, D-Generation X then defeated the McMahons and ECW World Champion Big Show in a 3-on-2 handicap Hell in a Cell match. During the match, DX embarrassed Vince by shoving his face in between Big Show's buttocks, and DX won when Triple H broke a sledgehammer over the shoulders of Mr. McMahon after Michaels performed a Sweet Chin Music on him.[97]\nAt Cyber Sunday during DX's feud with Rated-RKO, special guest referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal use of a weapon to give Rated-RKO the win.[97] At Survivor Series, DX got their revenge when their team defeated Edge and Orton's team in a clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match.[98] In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match.[99][100] Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.[99]\nTriple H made his return at SummerSlam, where he defeated King Booker.[101] Two months later at No Mercy, Triple H was originally scheduled to face Umaga in a singles match. However, at the start of the night, Triple H decided to challenge newly named WWE Champion Randy Orton, reigniting his rivalry with Orton that had been interrupted following his injury. Triple H won the match, winning his eleventh world championship and sixth WWE Championship,[102] and then defended his title against Umaga in his regularly scheduled match after Mr. McMahon declared the match to be for the WWE title.[103] After that McMahon gave Orton a rematch against Triple H in a Last Man Standing match in the main event, and Triple H lost after an RKO on a broadcast table.[103] Triple H's title reign at No Mercy is the fifth shortest reign in WWE history, only lasting through the duration of the event.[103] After winning the Raw Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out, Triple H gained a WWE Championship match by outlasting five other men, last eliminating Jeff Hardy after a Pedigree on a steel chair.[104] However, at WrestleMania XXIV, Orton retained after punting Triple H and pinning John Cena following Triple H's Pedigree on Cena.[105] A month later, at Backlash, Triple H won the title in a fatal four-way elimination match against Orton, Cena, and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, tying the record for most WWE Championship reigns with The Rock.[106] Triple H then retained the title against Orton at Judgment Day in a steel cage match and again at One Night Stand in a Last Man Standing match.[107][108] Orton suffered a legitimate collarbone injury during the match, thus ending the feud prematurely.[109]\nTriple H then went on to defeat cleanly John Cena to successfully defend the WWE Championship at Night of Champions.[110] On the June 23 episode of Raw, Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand as a part of the 2008 WWE draft, in the process making the WWE Championship exclusive to SmackDown.[111] He defended the championship over the summer by defeating the likes of Edge at The Great American Bash[112] and The Great Khali at SummerSlam,[113] and was the only champion to retain his title at Unforgiven's Championship Scramble matches.[114] After this, he successfully defended it against Jeff Hardy both at No Mercy[115] and Cyber Sunday.[116]\nAt Survivor Series, Triple H was scheduled to defend the championship against Vladimir Kozlov and Jeff Hardy, but Hardy was kept out of the match after a scripted attack and injury. During the match, SmackDown general manager Vickie Guerrero announced that Edge had returned and introduced him into the contest. Hardy interfered and hit Triple H with a steel chair meant for Edge, thus costing him the title after a 210 days reign and resulting in Edge winning his sixth world title.[117] After failing to regain the title at Armageddon,[118] Triple H entered seventh in the 2009 Royal Rumble, but was last eliminated by Randy Orton.[119] In February at No Way Out, Triple H won the WWE Championship in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, setting the record for most reigns at eight.[120] That record stood until 2011 when John Cena won his ninth WWE Championship.\nOn the February 16 episode of Raw, Triple H made an appearance aiding Stephanie and Shane McMahon, after they were attacked by Randy Orton.[121] On the February 20 episode of SmackDown, Triple H was interviewed by Jim Ross; in the interview, footage was shown highlighting the events that occurred on the February 16 episode of Raw. Ross asked Triple H how he felt seeing that footage, in response, he broke character (after 5 years of marriage) by admitting that Vince McMahon is his father-in-law, that Shane is his brother-in-law, and that Stephanie is his wife, thus creating a rivalry between Triple H and Orton. On the February 23 episode of Raw, Triple H confronted Orton, before attacking him, Ted DiBiase, and Cody Rhodes (a group known as The Legacy) with a sledgehammer and chasing them from the arena.[122] At WrestleMania XXV, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the title. He teamed with Shane McMahon and Batista against Orton and The Legacy in a six-man tag match for the WWE Championship at Backlash, which they lost after Orton pinned Triple H following a Punt Kick. After six weeks off of TV, selling the injury, he lost a Three Stages of Hell title match to Orton at The Bash. At Night of Champions, he again lost a title match to Orton in a triple threat match also involving John Cena.[citation needed]\nOn the August 10 episode of Raw, Triple H met with Michaels at an office cafeteria in Texas where Michaels was working as a chef; throughout the show, Triple H tried to convince Michaels to return to WWE from hiatus. After several incidents (including grease grill burgers on fire and Michaels shouting at a little girl), Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy at SummerSlam, superkicked the girl, and quit his chef job.[123] On the August 17 episode of Raw, Triple H and Michaels officially reunited as DX, but as they were in the process of their in-ring promo, The Legacy attacked them both.[124] Their first match after reuniting was against The Legacy at SummerSlam, which they won.[125] At Breaking Point, however, they lost to The Legacy in the first ever Submissions Count Anywhere match in WWE history.[126]\nAt Hell in a Cell, DX defeated The Legacy in a Hell in a Cell match.[127] DX unsuccessfully challenged John Cena for the WWE Championship in a triple threat match at Survivor Series,[128] after which they remained friends and partners. On December 13 at TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs, DX defeated Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and Big Show) to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.[129] This was their first tag team championship reign together.\nOn December 21, Triple H announced that Hornswoggle was the new DX mascot.[130] This came about after Hornswoggle sued DX for emotional and physical distress due to them not allowing him to join DX.[130] After being taken to court where they were ruled guilty by a jury and judge consisting of dwarves, Michaels told Triple H that Hornswoggle could be the mascot. Triple H agreed to it only if the charges were dropped, which Hornswoggle agreed to.[130] On January 11, 2010 episode of Raw, Mike Tyson, who was the Raw guest host for the night, teamed with Jericho to face DX; however, at the end of the bout, Tyson turned on Jericho and aligned himself with Triple H and Michaels.[131] On the February 8 episode of Raw, DX lost the Unified Tag Team Championship to ShoMiz (The Miz and Big Show) in a triple threat elimination tag match, also involving The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). On the March 1 episode of Raw, they lost a rematch for the title. This was their last televised match before Michaels retired.[132] Michaels and Triple H had a non-wrestling reunion at the 2010 Tribute to the Troops.\nOn February 21, Triple H eliminated then WWE Champion Sheamus from the Elimination Chamber match, though he did not win the title himself. Sheamus attacked him weeks later, setting up a match at WrestleMania XXVI, which Triple H won.[133][134] Also at WrestleMania, Michaels lost to The Undertaker and was forced to retire. While giving a farewell speech the next night, Sheamus attacked him and set up a rematch at Extreme Rules. Sheamus attacked Triple H at the start of the show, before later winning the match. Triple H then took time off to recover from injuries.[135] Triple H made an untelevized appearance on October 30 at the WWE Fan Appreciation Event and also at the 2010 Tribute to the Troops.[136]\nOn the February 21, 2011 episode of Raw, Triple H returned, interrupting the return of The Undertaker and challenging him to a match at WrestleMania XXVII, which later became a No Holds Barred match. A week later, he attacked Sheamus with a Pedigree through a broadcast table in retaliation for Sheamus giving him a ten-month injury. At WrestleMania XXVII, Triple H lost, which extended Undertaker's undefeated streak to 19\u20130; Undertaker was carried from the ring on a stretcher whereas Triple H left on his own accord.[137]\nAt the end of the July 18 episode of Raw, Triple H returned on behalf of WWE's board of directors to relieve his father-in-law Vince McMahon of his duties.[138] This was followed by the announcement that he had been assigned to take over as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the WWE. This was during a storyline where CM Punk had won the WWE Championship and left the company. Though a new champion was crowned, Triple H helped re-sign Punk and upheld both championship reigns. He announced he would referee a match to unify both WWE Championships at SummerSlam. Although he counted a pinfall for CM Punk to win, John Cena's leg was on the ropes, which would break the pin. Regardless, Triple H's longtime friend Kevin Nash attacked Punk immediately after the match to allow Alberto Del Rio to become the new champion.[139] Though Nash and Punk demanded a match against each other, Triple H fired Nash for insubordination and booked himself in a No Disqualification match at Night of Champions with his position of COO on the line.[140] He won the match despite interference from John Laurinaitis, Nash, The Miz and R-Truth.[141] After repeated attacks from these wrestlers in various matches, the majority of WWE's on-screen staff gave Triple H a vote of no confidence. Mr. McMahon returned to relieve him of his duties on Raw, though he remained the COO. He was replaced as general manager of Raw by Laurinaitis, who booked him in a tag team match against Miz and R-Truth at Vengeance.[142] During the match, Nash once again attacked him and did so the following night on the October 24 episode of Raw, hospitalizing him (kayfabe).[143] WWE later announced that Triple H had sustained a fractured vertebra, and would be out of action. He returned on December 12, as part of the Slammy Awards. On December 18, he defeated Nash at Tables, Ladders, and Chairs in sledgehammer ladder match, after attacking him with a sledgehammer.[144]\nTriple H returned on the January 30, 2012 episode of Raw to evaluate Laurinaitis' performance as general manager. Before he could announce the decision, he was interrupted by the returning Undertaker.[145] After initially refusing the rematch as he did not want to tarnish The Undertaker's legacy,[146] Triple H accepted the challenge after being called a coward who lives in Shawn Michaels' shadow, on the condition their rematch be contested inside Hell in a Cell.[147] Triple H went on to lose this match at WrestleMania XXVIII.[148]\nTriple H returned on the April 30 episode of Raw, when he refused to give in to Brock Lesnar's unreasonable contract demands, resulting in Lesnar attacking him and storyline breaking his arm.[149][150] Upon his return two weeks later, Triple H was confronted by Lesnar's legal representative, Paul Heyman, who announced Lesnar was filing a lawsuit against WWE for breach of contract. After he accosted Heyman, Heyman threatened another lawsuit against Triple H for assault and battery.[151] At the No Way Out in June, Triple H challenged Lesnar, who was not present, to a match at SummerSlam,[152] which Heyman refused on Lesnar's behalf the following night on Raw.[153] At Raw 1000, Stephanie McMahon goaded Heyman into Triple H's challenge against Lesnar.[154] To anger Triple H, Lesnar broke Michaels's arm on the August 13 episode of Raw.[155] Six days later at SummerSlam, Triple H lost to Lesnar after submitting to the Kimura Lock, breaking his arm again in storyline.[156][157]\nOn the August 27 episode of Raw, Triple H was supposed to address his potential retirement, but did not make a definitive decision.[158] On the December 17 episode of Raw, Triple H made a non-wrestling appearance for the 2012 Slammy Awards debuting with his new haircut.\nTriple H returned on the February 25, 2013 episode of Raw, brawling with Brock Lesnar after he attempted to attack Mr. McMahon. The brawl resulted in Lesnar having his head split open and requiring 18 stitches.[159] The following week, Triple H issued a challenge to Lesnar, requesting a rematch with him at WrestleMania 29, which Lesnar accepted on the condition that he could choose the stipulation.[160][161] The following week, after Triple H signed the contract and assaulted Heyman, the stipulation was revealed as No Holds Barred with Triple H's career on the line.[162] At WrestleMania, Triple H defeated Lesnar after a Pedigree onto the steel steps.[163] On the April 15 episode of Raw, Heyman challenged Triple H to face Lesnar in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules,[164] which Triple H accepted the following week.[165] Triple H ended up losing the match at the pay-per-view on May 19 thanks to interference from Heyman, and he also injured his jaw.[166]\nThe next night on Raw, Triple H wrestled Heyman's newest client, Curtis Axel. He suffered a storyline concussion and was deemed to have forfeited.[167][168][169] Despite being medically cleared to wrestle before the June 3 episode of Raw, Vince and Stephanie McMahon did not allow Triple H to wrestle Axel, citing concerns for his well-being and the safety of his children. In response, Triple H stormed out the arena and vowed to return to the ring the next week on Raw.[170] On that episode, he lost to Axel when McMahon dubiously disqualified him, ordered Axel to leave the ring, then stole the bell and microphone to prevent the match from being restarted.\nOn the August 12 episode of Raw, Triple H announced that he would be the special guest referee of the SummerSlam main event: the WWE Championship match between champion John Cena and Daniel Bryan before attacking Brad Maddox with a Pedigree. At the event, after Bryan won the match and the title, Triple H attacked Bryan with a Pedigree, allowing Randy Orton to cash in his Money in the Bank and win the title, turning heel for the first time since 2006.[171] Along with his wife Stephanie, they created The Authority, with The Shield as his enforcers and later Kane joining as the Director of Operations.\nOver the coming weeks he set up handicap matches against any wrestlers who questioned his decisions, such as Big Show and Dolph Ziggler, even firing Cody Rhodes in retaliation for the latter's insolence. On the October 7 episode of Raw, after \"firing\" Big Show, Show knocked him out in retaliation and was carried out by officials out of the arena.[172] At the 2013 Slammy Awards, Triple H immediately performed a Pedigree on Orton after Bryan shoved him into Stephanie McMahon, despite Orton's shock.[173]\nAt WrestleMania XXX, Triple H lost to Bryan, thereby granting Bryan a part in the subsequent title match against Batista and champion Randy Orton. Triple H assaulted Bryan after the match and later attempted to prevent Bryan from winning the title by interfering and recruiting Scott Armstrong as a crooked referee, but these attempts were unsuccessful as Bryan won the title by making Batista submit. In order to end Bryan's title reign, Triple H re-formed Evolution with Orton and Batista on the April 18 episode of SmackDown, but Bryan remained champion due to The Shield turning on The Authority. At Extreme Rules, Evolution lost to The Shield and again at Payback in a No Holds Barred elimination match.[174] On the June 2 episode of Raw, Batista would leave the group after Triple H refused to grant him his shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H would then resort to \"Plan B\", which would be Seth Rollins turning on The Shield and rejoining The Authority.\nOn the October 27 episode of Raw, Triple H would offer John Cena a chance to join forces with The Authority, which Cena refused. This led to Triple H announcing a five-on-five tag team elimination match for Survivor Series, with a team representing The Authority facing a team captained by Cena.[175] On the November 3 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon announced that if Team Authority would lose, they would be removed from power.[176] On the November 21 episode of SmackDown, Triple H announced that if Team Cena lost, all of Team Cena, except Cena himself, would be fired.[177] At Survivor Series, Big Show joined The Authority by betraying Cena, but Sting made his WWE debut, attacking crooked referee Scott Armstrong and Triple H, and assisted Dolph Ziggler in pinning Rollins to give Team Cena the victory, putting the Authority out of power.\nAfter being out of power for a month, Rollins coaxed Cena into reinstating The Authority on the December 29 episode of Raw, by holding Raw guest host Edge hostage with Big Show.[178] On the January 19 episode of Raw, Cena would defeat Rollins, Kane and Big Show in a handicap match when Sting distracted The Authority, allowing Cena to pin Rollins and win back the jobs of Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan, who had been fired two weeks previously by Triple H and Stephanie. On January 26, it was officially announced via WWE.com that Triple H challenged Sting to a \"face-to-face\" confrontation at Fastlane, which Sting accepted; at the confrontation, Sting challenged Triple H to a match at WrestleMania 31, which Triple H accepted.[179] At WrestleMania, Triple H defeated Sting with interference from D-Generation-X, but shook hands with Sting after the match. After his match with Sting, he and Stephanie McMahon were later confronted by The Rock and Ronda Rousey during a promo regarding the record crowd at the event.[180][181]\nThroughout 2015, Triple H maintained his role as the leader of The Authority, and was involved in mediating issues between Seth Rollins and Kane.[182][183] Over the summer, Triple H began to test Rollins by having him defend the championship against Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, John Cena, and Sting.[184][185][186][187]\nAfter Rollins suffered a legitimate severe knee injury at a live event, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was vacated and it was announced that there would be a tournament to determine a new champion at Survivor Series.[188][189] On the November 9 episode of Raw, Triple H offered to give Reigns a bye to the finals of the tournament if he joined The Authority, but Reigns refused.[190] At Survivor Series, Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose in the tournament finals to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H came out and attempted to congratulate Reigns, but was instead hit with a spear. This allowed Sheamus to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and quickly defeat Reigns to win the championship, resulting in Sheamus aligning with The Authority.[191]\nThe Authority made a rematch between Reigns and Sheamus for the title on the November 30 episode of Raw, with the stipulation that Dean Ambrose and The Usos would lose their Intercontinental Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship title shots if Reigns failed to win the match in under 5 minutes and 15 seconds (which was the length Reigns' title reign at Survivor Series); Reigns won by disqualification, allowing Ambrose and The Usos to keep their title shots.[192] At TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs, Sheamus retained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Reigns due to interference from The League of Nations. After the match, Reigns \"snapped\" and viciously attacked Sheamus as well as Triple H, who had come to calm Reigns. Due to the injuries (kayfabe) suffered from Reigns, Triple H took a hiatus from television.[193]\nTriple H returned at the 2016 Royal Rumble match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, as the unannounced 30th entrant. After eliminating the defending champion, Roman Reigns, he then eliminated Dean Ambrose to secure his second Royal Rumble win and 14th world championship overall.[194] After breaking Reigns' nose in storyline in which he received a massive ovation,[195] Triple H was then challenged by Ambrose,[196] whom he defeated at Roadblock to defend the title,[197] before dropping it back to Reigns \u2013 who had become the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Dean Ambrose and Brock Lesnar in a triple threat match at Fastlane[198] \u2013 at WrestleMania 32, ending his reign at 70 days.[199]\nAfter WrestleMania 32, with The Authority now disbanded, Triple H competed in the WWE Live tour of the United Kingdom in late April before taking a hiatus from WWE television, whilst occasionally appearing at NXT and Cruiserweight Classic events. He was present for the finales of the Cruiserweight Classic and the United Kingdom Championship Tournament, awarding the titles to T.J. Perkins[200] and Tyler Bate,[201] respectively.\nOn the August 29 episode of Raw, Triple H made his return by interfering in the main event for the recently vacated and established WWE Universal Championship. Firstly, he attacked rival Roman Reigns with a Pedigree, allowing former Authority stable member Seth Rollins to eliminate him, before attacking Rollins with a Pedigree, allowing Kevin Owens to win the title.[202] Triple H appeared at Clash of Champions on September 25, escorting his wife Stephanie McMahon from the building, after Owens successfully defended the Universal Championship against Rollins. On the January 23, 2017 episode of Raw, in a match between Rollins and Sami Zayn, Triple H's music hit, providing the distraction which led to Zayn defeating Rollins and, in the process, stealing Rollins' place in the Royal Rumble.[203] On January 28 at NXT TakeOver: San Antonio, Rollins would \"takeover\" the show and called out Triple H, who appeared and summoned security guards to escort Rollins out of the arena.[204] On January 30, Triple H made his first appearance on Raw since August 2016, supposedly to finally accept Rollins' challenge for a match. However, he did not, labeling Rollins as an abject failure, despite all the chances he was given. He called Rollins out to come and meet his destroyer, which he does so, only for him to be jumped by Samoa Joe.[205] Rollins suffered a legitimate knee injury in the ambush, casting doubt over the potential match with Triple H,[206] which led to a non-sanctioned match at WrestleMania 33 on April 2,[207] where Triple H lost to Rollins.[208]\nOn the November 13 episode of Raw, Triple H announced himself as the fifth member of Team Raw for Survivor Series.[209] At Survivor Series, team captain Kurt Angle was about to win the match for Raw but Triple H pedigreed Angle which also led to Angle's elimination in the match. However, later himself pinned the final member of Team Smackdown as it appeared Triple H wanted the credit for Raw's victory. After the match fellow sole survivor Braun Strowman powerslammed him twice. He was also seen hitting the video screen as he exited the stage.[210][211] Triple H appeared the following night on Raw, and Angle said that if Triple H were to ever attack him again, he would retaliate.\nTriple H's next appearance came at the 2018 Elimination Chamber event for the Raw contract signing of Ronda Rousey. During the segment, Triple H confirmed that there were no special stipulations in Rousey's contract, but she would have her debut match at WrestleMania 34. Before Rousey signed her contract, Kurt Angle brought up the incident from WrestleMania 31 where Rousey embarrassed The Authority and said that Triple H and Stephanie were now glad to own Rousey so they could manipulate her. This led to Rousey putting Triple H through a table and Stephanie slapped Rousey. Stephanie then retreated and Rousey signed the contract. The next night, the four had a segment to apologize and it ended with Triple H attacking Angle. The following week, Angle revealed that although Triple H and Stephanie were WWE executives, they also had contracts to compete as wrestlers. Angle reminded Triple H of his warning from after Survivor Series, and he scheduled himself and Rousey to face Triple H and Stephanie at WrestleMania 34 in a mixed tag team match. At the event, Triple H and Stephanie lost to Angle and Rousey after Stephanie submitted to Rousey's armbar. Triple H lost to John Cena at Greatest Royal Rumble event in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.[citation needed]\nTriple H begin to show signs of a face turn as he returned on the July 23 episode of Raw alongside Stephanie and Vince McMahon to announce the first ever all women's pay-per-view event, WWE Evolution.[212] Following the announcement, it was also announced Triple H would return to in-ring competition at WWE Super Show-Down to take on renowned nemesis, The Undertaker, one last time. On August 20, Triple H returned to Raw and spoke about how he reluctantly accepted the rematch as the last match between the two at WrestleMania XXVIII (a Hell in a Cell with Shawn Michaels as special guest referee) was billed as the \"End of an Era\". Triple H added that the tagline of this contest would be \"Last Time Ever\".[213] At the event, Triple H emerged victorious. After the match Triple H finally turned face for the first time since mid-2013, as he and Michaels showed respect for The Undertaker and Kane, as they embraced with each other. However the Undertaker and Kane would then proceed to attack them.[214] On October 8, Triple H and Shawn Michaels announced they will reunite DX, to face The Brothers of Destruction at Crown Jewel. At the event, they defeated the Brothers of Destruction, at the cost of Triple H tearing his pectoral muscles.[215] Triple H underwent successful surgery on November 8 with a timeframe for his return unknown.[216] On February 25's edition of Raw, Batista returned and attacked Ric Flair backstage as Flair was about to make an entrance for his birthday celebration and called out Triple H. On March 11's edition of Raw Batista challenged Triple H for a match at WrestleMania 35 which Triple H accepted and made it a No Holds Barred match. At the event, Triple H defeated Batista with assistance from Flair. Triple H lost to Randy Orton at Super ShowDown.\nOn the November 1 episode of SmackDown, Triple H and Shawn Michaels commandeered an invasion with NXT wrestlers, which started with Shayna Baszler attacking SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley, Sasha Banks and Nikki Cross, followed by Matt Riddle and Keith Lee attacking Sami Zayn, Rhea Ripley and Tegan Nox defeating Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville, Tommaso Ciampa defeating The Miz, and finished with Adam Cole successfully retaining the NXT Championship against Daniel Bryan in the main-event. After the match, Triple H and the rest of the NXT roster stormed the ring and declared war on both Raw and SmackDown, and vowed to win the Survivor Series brand warfare.[217][218]\nTriple H's finishing move is the Pedigree, a double underhook facebuster.[219] In 2016, Fox Sports selected the Pedigree as the ninth greatest finisher in wrestling history.[220]\nTriple H has been named as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.[221][222] In 2011, Pro Wrestling Torch stated he was \"widely regarded as the best wrestler in North America\" by the turn of the millennium.\"[9] Triple H has been praised for his heel persona, though he has been criticized for his last years as a wrestler. After his match against Undertaker and Kane at Crown Jewel in 2018, Dave Meltzer wrote, \"When Ric (Flair) was 48, he was a lot better than Triple H.\" Wade Keller from Pro Wrestling Torch wrote, \"Hunter moves like the trees in Wizard of Oz\".[223] Jason Powell from Prowrestling.net stated, \"They need to accept their limitations, stop pretending they belong in main events, and stop acting like being in these main events isn't stealing the spotlight.\"[224]\nIn 2010, Levesque's role as an Executive Senior Advisor was officially formalized as he was given an office at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.[225] Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011.[citation needed] In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's role within the company has been under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers view it as a way to keep him on top on-screen and to give him more television time. Levesque has spoken against this criticism and has denied all of it. Additionally, Levesque has been credited by many for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.[citation needed]\nAs the founder of NXT since its inception in 2012, Levesque has been widely praised for helping cultivate the brand, recruiting fresh new talent, and helping guide the brand to various levels of success including sold-out shows, increased respect for women's wrestling, and international expansion.[226][227][unreliable source][228]\nIn 2013, his title was elevated to Executive Vice-president of Talent, Live Events and Creative where he also works with WWE creative direction and storylines of WWE's programming.[229][third-party source needed]\nIn 2013, Levesque earned a combined salary of just over $1.5 million (U.S.) from his front office job and as a wrestler. He also owns just over $1.5 million (U.S.) in WWE stock.[6]\nIn 2014, Levesque and his wife Stephanie created the Connor's Cure cancer fund in honor of Connor \"The Crusher\" Michalek, a WWE fan who died of cancer at the age of eight.[230]\nWhat began as an on-screen storyline marriage in 2000 became a real-life romance when Levesque began dating Stephanie McMahon. They were married on October 25, 2003,[231] in Sleepy Hollow, New York. They have three daughters: Aurora Rose Levesque (born 2006),[232] Murphy Claire Levesque (born 2008),[233][234] and Vaughn Evelyn Levesque (born 2010).[235] Levesque was previously in a relationship with fellow wrestler Chyna from 1996 to 2000, but they split up over her personal issues and her disinterest in having children.[236]\nIn late 2004, Levesque released a book titled Making the Game: Triple H's Approach to a Better Body.[237] Mostly devoted to bodybuilding advice, the book also includes some autobiographical information, memoirs, and opinions. Levesque is teetotal.[238]\nLevesque is a fan of the band Mot\u00f6rhead, who have performed three different entrance themes for him over his career, and was good friends with lead singer Lemmy.[239] To pay homage, Levesque sported Lemmy-inspired facial hair during a large portion of his career.[240] He attended Lemmy's funeral on January 9, 2016, and spoke about the gift of sound that Lemmy and Mot\u00f6rhead gave to him and the friendship they had over the years.[241]\nDuring an interview with ITV London in December 2015, Levesque said that he is a supporter of West Ham United FC.[242] He is close friends with NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.[243][244]\n\n</body></html>"

His father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King.[10][11][12] Stephen's mother was Nellie Ruth (n\u00e9e Pillsbury).[12] The two were married on July 23, 1939, in Scarborough, Maine.[13] Shortly afterwards, they lived with Donald's family in Chicago, then moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York.[14] The Kings returned to Maine towards the end of World War II, living in a modest house in Scarborough. When King was two years old, his father left the family. King's mother raised Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved from Scarborough, depending on relatives in Chicago; Croton-on-Hudson; West De Pere, Wisconsin; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Malden, Massachusetts; and Stratford, Connecticut.[15][16] When King was 11, his family returned to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged.[1] King was raised Methodist[17] but lost his belief in organized religion while in high school. While no longer religious, King chooses to believe in the existence of God.[18] As a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works,[19] but King makes no mention of it in his memoir On Writing (2000). King related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (1981), in a chapter titled \"An Annoying Autobiographical Pause.\" King compares his uncle's dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as The Lurker in the Shadows, that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, \"I knew that I'd found home when I read that book.\"[20] King attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School, in Lisbon Falls, Maine in 1966.[21] He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC's horror comics, including Tales from the Crypt (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for Creepshow). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to Dave's Rag, the newspaper his brother published with a mimeograph machine, and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber\"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a fanzine, Comics Review, in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as \"In a Half-World of Terror\" in another fanzine, Stories of Suspense, edited by Marv Wolfman.[22] As a teen, King also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[23] From 1966, King studied at the University of Maine, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.[24] That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, Steve King's Garbage Truck, for the student newspaper, The Maine Campus, and participated in a writing workshop organized by Burton Hatlen.[25] King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry. King met his future wife, fellow student Tabitha Spruce, at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops; they wed in 1971.[25] King sold his first professional short story, \"The Glass Floor\", to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967.[1] After graduating from the University of Maine, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to men's magazines such as Cavalier. Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection Night Shift. The short story \"The Raft\" was published in Adam, a men's magazine. After being arrested for driving over a traffic cone, he was fined $250 and had no money to pay the petty larceny fine. However, payment arrived for the short story \"The Raft\" (then entitled \"The Float\"), and King was able to pay the fine.[26] In 1971, King was hired as a teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels.[1] In 1973, King's novel Carrie was accepted by publishing house Doubleday. Carrie was King's fourth novel,[27] but it was the first to be published. It was written on a portable typewriter that belonged to his wife. The novel began as a short story intended for Cavalier magazine, but King tossed the first three pages of his work in the garbage can.[28] Tabitha King fished the pages out of the garbage can and encouraged him to finish the story, saying that she would help him with the female perspective; he followed her advice and expanded it into a novel.[29] King said, \"I persisted because I was dry and had no better ideas\u2026 my considered opinion was that I had written the world's all-time loser.\"[30] According to The Guardian, Carrie \"is the story of Carrie White, a high-school student with latent\u2014and then, as the novel progresses, developing\u2014telekinetic powers. It's brutal in places, affecting in others (Carrie's relationship with her almost hysterically religious mother being a particularly damaged one), and gory in even more.\"[31] When Carrie was chosen for publication, King's phone was out of service. Doubleday editor William Thompson \u2013 who would eventually become King's close friend \u2013 sent a telegram to King's house in late March or early April 1973[32] which read: \"Carrie Officially A Doubleday Book. $2,500 Advance Against Royalties. Congrats, Kid \u2013 The Future Lies Ahead, Bill.\"[33] According to King, he bought a new Ford Pinto with the money from the advance.[32] On May 13, 1973, New American Library bought the paperback rights for $400,000, which\u2014in accordance with King's contract with Doubleday\u2014was split between them.[34][35] Carrie set King's career in motion and became a significant novel in the horror genre. In 1976, it was made into a successful horror film.[36] King's Salem's Lot was published in 1975. In a 1987 issue of The Highway Patrolman magazine, he stated, \"The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!\"[37] After his mother's death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where King wrote The Shining (published 1977). The family returned to western Maine in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, The Stand (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine.[38] In 1982, King published Different Seasons, a collection of four novellas with a more serious dramatic bent than the horror fiction for which King is famous.[39] The collection is notable for having had three of its four novellas turned into Hollywood films: Stand by Me (1986) was adapted from the novella The Body,[40] The Shawshank Redemption (1994) was adapted from the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,[41] and Apt Pupil (1998) was adapted from the novella of the same name.[42][43] In 1985, King wrote his first work for the comic book medium,[44] writing a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men. The book, whose profits were donated to assist with famine relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as Chris Claremont, Stan Lee, and Alan Moore, as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as Harlan Ellison.[45] The following year, King published It (1986), which was the best-selling hard-cover novel in the United States that year,[46] and wrote the introduction to Batman No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman.[47][48] In the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the \"Man in Black\" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. The first of these stories, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, was initially published in five installments by The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. The Gunslinger was continued as an eight-book epic series called The Dark Tower, whose books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades.[citation needed] In the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels\u2014Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981), The Running Man (1982) and Thinner (1984)\u2014under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year.[49] He picked up the name from the hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive, of which he is a fan.[50] Richard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels.[51] This led to a press release heralding Bachman's \"death\"\u2014supposedly from \"cancer of the pseudonym\".[52] King dedicated his 1989 book The Dark Half, about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to \"the deceased Richard Bachman\", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel Desperation was released, the companion novel The Regulators carried the \"Bachman\" byline. In 2006, during a press conference in London, King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled Blaze. It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's alma mater, the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.[53] King has used other pseudonyms. The short story \"The Fifth Quarter\" was published under the pseudonym John Swithen (the name of a character in the novel Carrie), by Cavalier in April 1972.[54] The story was reprinted in King's collection Nightmares & Dreamscapes in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel Blaze, King claims, with tongue-in-cheek, that \"Bachman\" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym. The \"children's book\" Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower was published in 2016 under the pseudonym Beryl Evans, who was portrayed by actress Allison Davies during a book signing at San Diego Comic-Con,[55] and illustrated by Ned Dameron. It is adapted from a fictional book central to the plot of King's previous novel The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands.[56] In 2000, King published online a serialized horror novel, The Plant.[57] At first the public presumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later stated that he had simply run out of stories.[58] The unfinished epistolary novel is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, Riding the Bullet, and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market \"probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012\". But he also warns: \"Here's the thing\u2014people tire of the new toys quickly.\"[59] King wrote the first draft of the 2001 novel Dreamcatcher with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen, which he called \"the world's finest word processor\".[60] In August 2003, King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in Entertainment Weekly, usually every third week. The column was called The Pop of King (a play on the nickname \"The King of Pop\" commonly attributed to Michael Jackson).[61] In 2006, King published an apocalyptic novel, Cell. The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer. King noted in the book's introduction that he does not use cell phones.[citation needed] In 2008, King published both a novel, Duma Key, and a collection, Just After Sunset. The latter featured 13 short stories, including a previously unpublished novella, N. Starting July 28, 2008, N. was released as a serialized animated series to lead up to the release of Just After Sunset.[62] In 2009, King published Ur, a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation Amazon Kindle and available only on Amazon.com, and Throttle, a novella co-written with his son Joe Hill and released later as an audiobook titled Road Rage, which included Richard Matheson's short story \"Duel\". King's novel Under the Dome was published on November 10 of that year; it is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since It (1986). Under the Dome debuted at No. 1 in The New York Times Bestseller List.[63] On February 16, 2010, King announced on his Web site that his next book would be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas called Full Dark, No Stars. In April of that year, King published Blockade Billy, an original novella issued first by independent small press Cemetery Dance Publications and later released in mass-market paperback by Simon & Schuster. The following month, DC Comics premiered American Vampire, a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer Scott Snyder, and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, which represents King's first original comics work.[64][65][66] King wrote the background history of the very first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc. Scott Snyder wrote the story of Pearl.[67] King's next novel, 11/22/63, was published November 8, 2011,[68][69] and was nominated for the 2012 World Fantasy Award Best Novel.[70] The eighth Dark Tower volume, The Wind Through the Keyhole, was published in 2012.[71] King's next book was Joyland, a novel about \"an amusement-park serial killer\", according to an article in The Sunday Times, published on April 8, 2012.[72] During his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King indicated that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer. With a working title Mr. Mercedes and inspired by a true event about a woman driving her car into a McDonald's restaurant, it was originally meant to be a short story just a few pages long.[73] In an interview with Parade, published May 26, 2013, King confirmed that the novel was \"more or less\" completed[74] he published it in June 2013. Later, on June 20, 2013, while doing a video chat with fans as part of promoting the upcoming Under the Dome TV series, King mentioned he was halfway through writing his next novel, Revival,[75] which was released November 11, 2014.[76] King announced in June 2014 that Mr. Mercedes is part of a trilogy; the second book, Finders Keepers, was released on June 2, 2015. On April 22, 2015, it was revealed that King was working on the third book of the trilogy, End of Watch, which was ultimately released on June 7, 2016.[77][78] During a tour to promote End of Watch, King revealed that he had collaborated on a novel, set in a women's prison in West Virginia, with his son, Owen King to be titled Sleeping Beauties.[79] King has written two novels with horror novelist Peter Straub: The Talisman (1984) and a sequel, Black House (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no deadline for its completion.[citation needed] King produced an artist's book with designer Barbara Kruger, My Pretty Pony (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alfred A. Knopf released it in a general trade edition.[80] The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries Rose Red (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a diary by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional afterword by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to Rose Red, titled The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer. This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries Kingdom Hospital. Richard Dooling, King's collaborator on Kingdom Hospital and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, The Journals of Eleanor Druse, in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in Kingdom Hospital, much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in Rose Red.[citation needed] Throttle (2009), a novella written in collaboration with his son Joe Hill, appears in the anthology He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson.[81] Their second novella collaboration, In the Tall Grass (2012), was published in two parts in Esquire.[82][83] It was later released in e-book and audiobook formats, the latter read by Stephen Lang.[84] King and his son Owen King wrote the novel Sleeping Beauties, released in 2017, that is set in a women's prison.[85] In 1988, the band Blue \u00d6yster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song \"Astronomy\". The single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King.[86][87] The Blue \u00d6yster Cult song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" was also used in the King TV series The Stand.[88] King collaborated with Michael Jackson to create Ghosts (1996), a 40-minute musical video.[89] King states he was motivated to collaborate as he is \"always interested in trying something new, and for (him), writing a minimusical would be new\".[90] In 2012 King collaborated with musician Shooter Jennings and his band Hierophant, providing the narration for their album, Black Ribbons.[91] King played guitar for the rock band Rock Bottom Remainders, several of whose members are authors. Other members include Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Greg Iles. King and the other band members collaborated to release an e-book called Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All (June 2013).[92][93] King wrote a musical entitled Ghost Brothers of Darkland County (2012) with musician John Mellencamp.[citation needed] King's formula for learning to write well is: \"Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer.\" He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: \"If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented.\"[94] When asked why he writes, King responds: \"The answer to that is fairly simple\u2014there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do.\"[95] He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: \"Why do you assume I have a choice?\"[96] King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a \"what if\" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.[97] King often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of fictional books in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in Misery, adult Bill Denbrough in It, Ben Mears in 'Salem's Lot, and Jack Torrance in The Shining. He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the Dark Tower series from Wolves of the Calla onwards. See also List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for Fangoria.[98] King has called Richard Matheson \"the author who influenced me most as a writer.\"[99] In a current edition of Matheson's The Shrinking Man, King is quoted as saying, \"A horror story if there ever was one...a great adventure story\u2014it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading.\"[citation needed] Other acknowledged influences include Ray Bradbury,[100] Joseph Payne Brennan,[101] Elmore Leonard,[102] John D. MacDonald, and Don Robertson.[103] King's The Shining is immersed in gothic influences, including \"The Masque of the Red Death\" by Edgar Allan Poe (which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto).[104] The Overlook Hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle, and Jack Torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption.[104] King's favorite books are (in order): The Golden Argosy; Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; The Satanic Verses; McTeague; Lord of the Flies; Bleak House; Nineteen Eighty-Four; The Raj Quartet; Light in August; and Blood Meridian.[105] Science fiction editors John Clute and Peter Nichols[106] offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his \"pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers.\" In his book The Philosophy of Horror (1990), No\u00ebl Carroll discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, \"the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed.\"[107] In his analysis of post\u2013World War II horror fiction, The Modern Weird Tale (2001), critic S. T. Joshi[108] devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels) are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since Gerald's Game (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written.[citation needed] In 1996, King won an O. Henry Award for his short story \"The Man in the Black Suit\".[109] In his short story collection A Century of Great Suspense Stories, editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King \"singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that 'Salem's Lot was \"Peyton Place meets Dracula. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters.\"[110] In 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon & Schuster, described King's work as \"non-literature\" and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice: The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for \"distinguished contribution\" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.[111]Orson Scott Card responded: Let me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.[112]In 2008, King's book On Writing was ranked 21st on Entertainment Weekly list of \"The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008\".[113] King and his wife Tabitha own Zone Radio Corp, a radio station group consisting of WZON/620 AM,[114] WKIT-FM/100.3 & WZLO/103.1. King tried his hand at directing with Maximum Overdrive, in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning ATM.[115] King produced and acted in a television series, Kingdom Hospital, which is based on the Danish miniseries Riget by Lars von Trier.[116] In 2010, King appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named Bachman (a reference to his pen name Richard Bachman) on the FX series Sons of Anarchy.[117] The Syfy TV series Haven is based on King's novella, The Colorado Kid.[118] In 2019, King appeared in a cameo role as a thrift store owner in It Chapter Two.[119] In April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns, which he believed were the actual causes of violence.[120] A controversy emerged on May 5, 2008 when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a Library of Congress reading event on the Web site NewsBusters. King, talking to high-school students, had said: \"If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that.\"[121] The comment was described by the blog as \"another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military,\" and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006.[122] King responded later that day, saying, \"That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career\u2014military or otherwise.\" King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. King added that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some.[123] During the 2008 presidential election, King voiced his support for Democratic candidate Barack Obama.[124] King was quoted as calling conservative commentator Glenn Beck \"Satan's mentally challenged younger brother.\"[125] On March 8, 2011, King spoke at a political rally in Sarasota aimed against Governor Rick Scott (R-FL), voicing his opposition to the Tea Party movement.[126] On April 30, 2012, King published an article in The Daily Beast calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as \"a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion\".[127] On January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled \"Guns\" via Amazon.com's Kindle single feature, which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, \"Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use.\"[128][129] The essay became the fifth-bestselling non-fiction title for the Kindle.[130] King has criticized Donald Trump and Rep. Steve King, deeming them racists.[131][132][133] In June 2018, King called for the release of the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov who is jailed in Russia.[134] King endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins.[135] King publicly criticized Paul LePage during LePage's tenure as Governor of Maine, referring to him as one of The Three Stooges (with then-Florida Governor Rick Scott and then-Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker being the other two).[126] He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a 2015 radio address that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office, but no apology was issued. King said LePage was \"full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green\"[136] and demanded that LePage \"man up and apologize\".[137] LePage declined to apologize to King, stating, \"I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said.\"[138] The attention garnered by the LePage criticism led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018.[139] King stated he would not run or serve.[140] King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015 calling LePage \"a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign.\" He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to \"go to work or go back home.\"[141] On August 27, 2016, King called LePage \"a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist\".[142] King has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year \"to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts.\"[127][143] The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by King and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.[144] In November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his home town of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.[145] King married Tabitha Spruce on January 2, 1971.[146] She too is a novelist and philanthropic activist. The couple own and divide their time between three houses: one in Bangor, Maine (set to become a museum and writer's retreat[147]); one in Lovell, Maine; and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. The Kings have three children, a daughter and two sons, and four grandchildren.[1] Their daughter Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with her lesbian partner, Rev. Dr. Thandeka.[148] Both of the Kings' sons are authors: Owen King published his first collection of stories, We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories, in 2005. Joseph Hillstrom King, who writes as Joe Hill, published a collection of short stories, 20th Century Ghosts, in 2005. His debut novel, Heart-Shaped Box (2007), was optioned by Warners Bros.[149] In the early 1970s, King developed a drinking problem which would plague him for more than a decade.[150] Soon after Carrie's release in 1974, King's mother died of uterine cancer; King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk while delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.[151]:69 King's addictions to alcohol and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he acknowledged in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo.[151]:73 Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug in front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since.[151]:72 The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.[152] On June 19, 1999, at about 4:30\u00a0p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5.[151]:206 According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking.[153] In his book On Writing, King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car, also northbound, passed King first and then the light-blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, and the woman told her passenger she hoped \"that guy in the van doesn't hit him.\"[151]:206 King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. He was transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries\u2014a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip\u2014kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator.[154] After five operations in 10 days and physical therapy, King resumed work on On Writing in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about 40 minutes before the pain became unbearable.[151]:216 King's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, to King's disappointment, as he had fantasized about smashing it.[155][156]",

His books have sold more than 350 million copies,[2] many of which have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, television series, and comic books. King has published 61 novels (including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman) and six non-fiction books.[3] He has written approximately 200 short stories,[4][5] most of which have been published in book collections.\nKing has received Bram Stoker Awards, World Fantasy Awards, and British Fantasy Society Awards. In 2003, the National Book Foundation awarded him the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.[6] He has also received awards for his contribution to literature for his entire oeuvre, such as the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement (2004) and the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America (2007).[7] In 2015, King was awarded with a National Medal of Arts from the United States National Endowment for the Arts for his contributions to literature.[8] He has been described as the \"King of Horror\".[9]\nStephen King was born September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. His father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King.[10][11][12] Stephen's mother was Nellie Ruth (n\u00e9e Pillsbury).[12] The two were married on July 23, 1939, in Scarborough, Maine.[13] Shortly afterwards, they lived with Donald's family in Chicago, then moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York.[14]\nThe Kings returned to Maine towards the end of World War II, living in a modest house in Scarborough. When King was two years old, his father left the family. King's mother raised Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved from Scarborough, depending on relatives in Chicago; Croton-on-Hudson; West De Pere, Wisconsin; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Malden, Massachusetts; and Stratford, Connecticut.[15][16] When King was 11, his family returned to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged.[1] King was raised Methodist[17] but lost his belief in organized religion while in high school. While no longer religious, King chooses to believe in the existence of God.[18]\nAs a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works,[19] but King makes no mention of it in his memoir On Writing (2000).\nKing related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (1981), in a chapter titled \"An Annoying Autobiographical Pause.\" King compares his uncle's dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as The Lurker in the Shadows,  that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes &amp; Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, \"I knew that I'd found home when I read that book.\"[20]\nKing attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School, in Lisbon Falls, Maine in 1966.[21] He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC's horror comics, including Tales from the Crypt (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for Creepshow). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to Dave's Rag, the newspaper his brother published with a mimeograph machine, and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber\"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a fanzine, Comics Review, in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as \"In a Half-World of Terror\" in another fanzine, Stories of Suspense, edited by Marv Wolfman.[22] As a teen, King also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[23]\nFrom 1966, King studied at the University of Maine, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.[24] That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, Steve King's Garbage Truck, for the student newspaper, The Maine Campus, and participated in a writing workshop organized by Burton Hatlen.[25] King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry. King met his future wife, fellow student Tabitha Spruce, at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops; they wed in 1971.[25]\nKing sold his first professional short story, \"The Glass Floor\", to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967.[1]\nAfter graduating from the University of Maine, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to men's magazines such as Cavalier. Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection Night Shift. The short story \"The Raft\" was published in Adam, a men's magazine. After being arrested for driving over a traffic cone, he was fined $250 and had no money to pay the petty larceny fine. However, payment arrived for the short story \"The Raft\" (then entitled \"The Float\"), and King was able to pay the fine.[26] In 1971, King was hired as a teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels.[1]\nIn 1973, King's novel Carrie was accepted by publishing house Doubleday. Carrie was King's fourth novel,[27] but it was the first to be published. It was written on a portable typewriter that belonged to his wife. The novel began as a short story intended for Cavalier magazine, but King tossed the first three pages of his work in the garbage can.[28] Tabitha King fished the pages out of the garbage can and encouraged him to finish the story, saying that she would help him with the female perspective; he followed her advice and expanded it into a novel.[29] King said, \"I persisted because I was dry and had no better ideas\u2026 my considered opinion was that I had written the world's all-time loser.\"[30] According to The Guardian, Carrie \"is the story of Carrie White, a high-school student with latent\u2014and then, as the novel progresses, developing\u2014telekinetic powers. It's brutal in places, affecting in others (Carrie's relationship with her almost hysterically religious mother being a particularly damaged one), and gory in even more.\"[31]\nWhen Carrie was chosen for publication, King's phone was out of service. Doubleday editor William Thompson \u2013 who would eventually become King's close friend \u2013 sent a telegram to King's house in late March or early April 1973[32] which read: \"Carrie Officially A Doubleday Book. $2,500 Advance Against Royalties. Congrats, Kid \u2013 The Future Lies Ahead, Bill.\"[33] According to King, he bought a new Ford Pinto with the money from the advance.[32] On May 13, 1973, New American Library bought the paperback rights for $400,000, which\u2014in accordance with King's contract with Doubleday\u2014was split between them.[34][35] Carrie set King's career in motion and became a significant novel in the horror genre. In 1976, it was made into a successful horror film.[36]\nKing's Salem's Lot was published in 1975. In a 1987 issue of The Highway Patrolman magazine, he stated, \"The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!\"[37] After his mother's death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where King wrote The Shining (published 1977). The family returned to western Maine in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, The Stand (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine.[38]\nIn 1982, King published Different Seasons, a collection of four novellas with a more serious dramatic bent than the horror fiction for which King is famous.[39] The collection is notable for having had three of its four novellas turned into Hollywood films: Stand by Me (1986) was adapted from the novella The Body,[40] The Shawshank Redemption (1994) was adapted from the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,[41] and Apt Pupil (1998) was adapted from the novella of the same name.[42][43]\nIn 1985, King wrote his first work for the comic book medium,[44] writing a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men. The book, whose profits were donated to assist with famine relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as Chris Claremont, Stan Lee, and Alan Moore, as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as Harlan Ellison.[45] The following year, King published It (1986), which was the best-selling hard-cover novel in the United States that year,[46] and wrote the introduction to Batman No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman.[47][48]\nIn the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the \"Man in Black\" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. The first of these stories, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, was initially published in five installments by The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. The Gunslinger was continued as an eight-book epic series called The Dark Tower, whose books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades.[citation needed]\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels\u2014Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981), The Running Man (1982) and Thinner (1984)\u2014under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year.[49] He picked up the name from the hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive, of which he is a fan.[50]\nRichard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels.[51] This led to a press release heralding Bachman's \"death\"\u2014supposedly from \"cancer of the pseudonym\".[52] King dedicated his 1989 book The Dark Half, about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to \"the deceased Richard Bachman\", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel Desperation was released, the companion novel The Regulators carried the \"Bachman\" byline.\nIn 2006, during a press conference in London, King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled Blaze. It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's alma mater, the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.[53]\nKing has used other pseudonyms. The short story \"The Fifth Quarter\" was published under the pseudonym John Swithen (the name of a character in the novel Carrie), by Cavalier in April 1972.[54] The story was reprinted in King's collection Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel Blaze, King claims, with tongue-in-cheek, that \"Bachman\" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym.\nThe \"children's book\" Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower was published in 2016 under the pseudonym Beryl Evans, who was portrayed by actress Allison Davies during a book signing at San Diego Comic-Con,[55] and illustrated by Ned Dameron. It is adapted from a fictional book central to the plot of King's previous novel The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands.[56]\nIn 2000, King published online a serialized horror novel, The Plant.[57] At first the public presumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later stated that he had simply run out of stories.[58] The unfinished epistolary novel is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, Riding the Bullet, and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market \"probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012\". But he also warns: \"Here's the thing\u2014people tire of the new toys quickly.\"[59]\nKing wrote the first draft of the 2001 novel Dreamcatcher with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen, which he called \"the world's finest word processor\".[60]\nIn August 2003, King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in Entertainment Weekly, usually every third week. The column was called The Pop of King (a play on the nickname \"The King of Pop\" commonly attributed to Michael Jackson).[61]\nIn 2006, King published an apocalyptic novel, Cell. The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer. King noted in the book's introduction that he does not use cell phones.[citation needed]\nIn 2008, King published both a novel, Duma Key, and a collection, Just After Sunset. The latter featured 13 short stories, including a previously unpublished novella, N. Starting July 28, 2008, N. was released as a serialized animated series to lead up to the release of Just After Sunset.[62]\nIn 2009, King published Ur, a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation Amazon Kindle and available only on Amazon.com, and Throttle, a novella co-written with his son Joe Hill and released  later as an audiobook titled Road Rage, which included Richard Matheson's short story \"Duel\". King's novel Under the Dome was published on November 10 of that year; it is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since It (1986). Under the Dome debuted at No. 1 in The New York Times Bestseller List.[63]\nOn February 16, 2010, King announced on his Web site that his next book would be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas called Full Dark, No Stars. In April of that year, King published Blockade Billy, an original novella issued first by independent small press Cemetery Dance Publications and later released in mass-market paperback by Simon &amp; Schuster. The following month, DC Comics premiered American Vampire, a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer Scott Snyder, and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, which represents King's first original comics work.[64][65][66] King wrote the background history of the very first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc. Scott Snyder wrote the story of Pearl.[67]\nKing's next novel, 11/22/63, was published November 8, 2011,[68][69] and was nominated for the 2012 World Fantasy Award Best Novel.[70]  The eighth Dark Tower volume, The Wind Through the Keyhole, was published in 2012.[71] King's next book was Joyland, a novel about \"an amusement-park serial killer\", according to an article in The Sunday Times, published on April 8, 2012.[72]\nDuring his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King indicated that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer. With a working title Mr. Mercedes and inspired by a true event about a woman driving her car into a McDonald's restaurant, it was originally meant to be a short story just a few pages long.[73] In an interview with Parade, published May 26, 2013, King confirmed that the novel was \"more or less\" completed[74] he published it in June 2013. Later, on June 20, 2013, while doing a video chat with fans as part of promoting the upcoming Under the Dome TV series, King mentioned he was halfway through writing his next novel, Revival,[75] which was released November 11, 2014.[76]\nKing announced in June 2014 that Mr. Mercedes is part of a trilogy; the second book, Finders Keepers, was released on June 2, 2015. On April 22, 2015, it was revealed that King was working on the third book of the trilogy, End of Watch, which was ultimately released on June 7, 2016.[77][78]\nDuring a tour to promote End of Watch, King revealed that he had collaborated on a novel, set in a women's prison in West Virginia, with his son, Owen King to be titled Sleeping Beauties.[79]\nKing has written two novels with horror novelist Peter Straub: The Talisman (1984) and a sequel, Black House (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no deadline for its completion.[citation needed]\nKing produced an artist's book with designer Barbara Kruger, My Pretty Pony (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alfred A. Knopf released it in a general trade edition.[80]\nThe Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries Rose Red (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a diary by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional afterword by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to Rose Red, titled The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer. This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries Kingdom Hospital. Richard Dooling, King's collaborator on Kingdom Hospital and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, The Journals of Eleanor Druse, in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in Kingdom Hospital, much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in Rose Red.[citation needed]\nThrottle (2009), a novella written in collaboration with his son Joe Hill, appears in the anthology He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson.[81]  Their second novella collaboration, In the Tall Grass (2012), was published in two parts in Esquire.[82][83] It was later released in e-book and audiobook formats, the latter read by Stephen Lang.[84]\nKing and his son Owen King wrote the novel Sleeping Beauties, released in 2017, that is set in a women's prison.[85]\nIn 1988, the band Blue \u00d6yster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song \"Astronomy\". The single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King.[86][87] The Blue \u00d6yster Cult song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" was also used in the King TV series The Stand.[88]\nKing collaborated with Michael Jackson to create Ghosts (1996), a 40-minute musical video.[89] King states he was motivated to collaborate as he is \"always interested in trying something new, and for (him), writing a minimusical would be new\".[90] In 2012 King collaborated with musician Shooter Jennings and his band Hierophant, providing the narration for their album, Black Ribbons.[91] King played guitar for the rock band Rock Bottom Remainders, several of whose members are authors. Other members include Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Greg Iles. King and the other band members collaborated to release an e-book called Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All (June 2013).[92][93] King wrote a musical entitled Ghost Brothers of Darkland County (2012) with musician John Mellencamp.[citation needed]\nKing's formula for learning to write well is: \"Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer.\" He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: \"If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented.\"[94]\nWhen asked why he writes, King responds: \"The answer to that is fairly simple\u2014there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do.\"[95] He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: \"Why do you assume I have a choice?\"[96] King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a \"what if\" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.[97]\nKing often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of fictional books in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in Misery, adult Bill Denbrough in It, Ben Mears in 'Salem's Lot, and Jack Torrance in The Shining. He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the Dark Tower series from Wolves of the Calla onwards. See also List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for Fangoria.[98]\nKing has called Richard Matheson \"the author who influenced me most as a writer.\"[99] In a current edition of Matheson's The Shrinking Man, King is quoted as saying, \"A horror story if there ever was one...a great adventure story\u2014it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading.\"[citation needed]\nOther acknowledged influences include Ray Bradbury,[100] Joseph Payne Brennan,[101] Elmore Leonard,[102] John D. MacDonald, and Don Robertson.[103]\nKing's The Shining is immersed in gothic influences, including \"The Masque of the Red Death\" by Edgar Allan Poe (which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto).[104] The Overlook Hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle, and Jack Torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption.[104]\nKing's favorite books are (in order): The Golden Argosy; Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; The Satanic Verses; McTeague; Lord of the Flies; Bleak House; Nineteen Eighty-Four; The Raj Quartet; Light in August; and Blood Meridian.[105]\nScience fiction editors John Clute and Peter Nichols[106] offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his \"pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers.\"\nIn his book The Philosophy of Horror (1990), No\u00ebl Carroll discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, \"the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed.\"[107]\nIn his analysis of post\u2013World War II horror fiction, The Modern Weird Tale (2001), critic S. T. Joshi[108] devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels) are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since Gerald's Game (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written.[citation needed]\nIn 1996, King won an O. Henry Award for his short story \"The Man in the Black Suit\".[109]\nIn his short story collection A Century of Great Suspense Stories, editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King \"singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that 'Salem's Lot was \"Peyton Place meets Dracula. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters.\"[110]\nIn 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon &amp; Schuster, described King's work as \"non-literature\" and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice:\nThe decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for \"distinguished contribution\" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.[111]Orson Scott Card responded:\nLet me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.[112]In 2008, King's book On Writing was ranked 21st on Entertainment Weekly list of \"The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008\".[113]\nKing and his wife Tabitha own Zone Radio Corp, a radio station group consisting of WZON/620 AM,[114] WKIT-FM/100.3 &amp; WZLO/103.1.\nKing tried his hand at directing with Maximum Overdrive, in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning ATM.[115]\nKing produced and acted in a television series, Kingdom Hospital, which is based on the Danish miniseries Riget by Lars von Trier.[116]\nIn 2010, King appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named Bachman (a reference to his pen name Richard Bachman) on the FX series Sons of Anarchy.[117]\nThe Syfy TV series Haven is based on King's novella, The Colorado Kid.[118]\nIn 2019, King appeared in a cameo role as a thrift store owner in It Chapter Two.[119]\nIn April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns, which he believed were the actual causes of violence.[120]\nA controversy emerged on May 5, 2008 when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a Library of Congress reading event on the Web site NewsBusters. King, talking to high-school students, had said: \"If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that.\"[121]  The comment was described by the blog as \"another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military,\" and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006.[122]  King responded later that day, saying, \"That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career\u2014military or otherwise.\" King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. King added that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some.[123]\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, King voiced his support for Democratic candidate Barack Obama.[124]  King was quoted as calling conservative commentator Glenn Beck \"Satan's mentally challenged younger brother.\"[125]\nOn March 8, 2011, King spoke at a political rally in Sarasota aimed against Governor Rick Scott (R-FL), voicing his opposition to the Tea Party movement.[126]\nOn April 30, 2012, King published an article in The Daily Beast calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as \"a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion\".[127]\nOn January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled \"Guns\" via Amazon.com's Kindle single feature, which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.  King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, \"Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use.\"[128][129]  The essay became the fifth-bestselling non-fiction title for the Kindle.[130]\nKing has criticized Donald Trump and Rep. Steve King, deeming them racists.[131][132][133]\nIn June 2018, King called for the release of the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov who is jailed in Russia.[134]\nKing endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins.[135]\nKing publicly criticized Paul LePage during LePage's tenure as Governor of Maine, referring to him as one of The Three Stooges (with then-Florida Governor Rick Scott and then-Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker being the other two).[126]  He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a 2015 radio address that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office, but no apology was issued. King said LePage was \"full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green\"[136] and demanded that LePage \"man up and apologize\".[137]  LePage declined to apologize to King, stating, \"I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said.\"[138]\nThe attention garnered by the LePage criticism led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018.[139] King stated he would not run or serve.[140] King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015 calling LePage \"a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign.\" He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to \"go to work or go back home.\"[141] On August 27, 2016, King called LePage \"a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist\".[142]\nKing has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year \"to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts.\"[127][143]\nThe Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by King and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.[144]\nIn November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his home town of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.[145]\nKing married Tabitha Spruce on January 2, 1971.[146] She too is a novelist and philanthropic activist. The couple own and divide their time between three houses: one in Bangor, Maine (set to become a museum and writer's retreat[147]); one in Lovell, Maine; and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. The Kings have three children, a daughter and two sons, and four grandchildren.[1] Their daughter Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with her lesbian partner, Rev. Dr. Thandeka.[148] Both of the Kings' sons are authors: Owen King published his first collection of stories, We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories, in 2005. Joseph Hillstrom King, who writes as Joe Hill, published a collection of short stories, 20th Century Ghosts, in 2005. His debut novel, Heart-Shaped Box (2007), was optioned by Warners Bros.[149]\nIn the early 1970s, King developed a drinking problem which would plague him for more than a decade.[150] Soon after Carrie's release in 1974, King's mother died of uterine cancer; King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk while delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.[151]:69 King's addictions to alcohol and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he acknowledged in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo.[151]:73 Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug in front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since.[151]:72 The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.[152]\nOn June 19, 1999, at about 4:30\u00a0p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5.[151]:206 According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking.[153] In his book On Writing, King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car, also northbound, passed King first and then the light-blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, and the woman told her passenger she hoped \"that guy in the van doesn't hit him.\"[151]:206\nKing was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. He was transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries\u2014a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip\u2014kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator.[154] After five operations in 10 days and physical therapy, King resumed work on On Writing in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about 40 minutes before the pain became unbearable.[151]:216\nKing's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, to King's disappointment, as he had fantasized about smashing it.[155][156]\n\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJordan Bernt Peterson (born June 12, 1962) is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. His main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology,[1] with a particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief[2] and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.[3] Peterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. He was a post-doctoral fellow at McGill from 1991 to 1993 before moving to Harvard University, where he was an assistant professor in the psychology department.[4][5] In 1998, he returned to Canada to become a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, where he eventually became a full professor.[6] Peterson's first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide.[7][8][9] His second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, was published in January 2018.[4][10][11] In 2016, Peterson released a series[12] of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian government's Bill C-16, \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The act added \"gender identity and expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination,[a][13] which Peterson characterised as an introduction of compelled speech into law,[14][15][16] although legal experts have disagreed.[17] He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.[4][10][11] Several writers have associated Peterson with an \"Intellectual Dark Web\".[18][19][20][21][22] Peterson was born on June 12, 1962.[23] He grew up in Fairview, Alberta, a small town northwest of his birthplace (Edmonton).[24] He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher.[25][26] His middle name is Bernt (/\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r\u0259nt/ BAIR-\u0259nt),[27] after his Norwegian great-grandfather.[28] When Peterson was 13, he was introduced to the writings of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ayn Rand by his school librarian Sandy Notley (the mother of Rachel Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th Premier of Alberta).[29] He worked for the New Democratic Party (NDP) throughout his teenage years, but grew disenchanted with the party. He saw his experience of disillusionment resonating with Orwell's diagnosis, in The Road to Wigan Pier, of \"the intellectual, tweed-wearing middle-class socialist\" who \"didn't like the poor; they just hated the rich\".[25][30] He left the NDP at age 18.[31] After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature.[2] He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982.[31] Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe. There he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War, 20th-century European totalitarianism,[2][32] and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,[25] and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[32] He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984.[33] In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.[2][34] From July 1993 to June 1998,[1] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals.[31] Two former Ph.D. students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students.[4] In July 1998, he returned to Canada and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.[1][33] Peterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational,[1] religious, ideological,[2] political, and creativity psychology.[3] Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers[35] and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017.[36] For most of his career, Peterson had an active clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He had been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16.[12][29][37] As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017[10] and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018.[26][38] In June 2018, Peterson debated with Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver while moderated by Bret Weinstein, and again in July at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London while moderated by Douglas Murray, over the topic of religion and God.[39][40] In April 2019, Peterson debated professor Slavoj \u017di\u017eek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.[41][42] In 1999 Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs and make narratives using ideas from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and psychology in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.[31][5][43] According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in social conflict, explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification[31]) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Rwandan genocide.[31][5][43] He considers that an \"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality\".[43] Jungian archetypes play an important role in the book.[4] In 2004, a 13-part TV series based on Peterson's book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief aired on TVOntario.[25][33][44] In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. The work contains abstract ethical principles about life, in a more accessible style than Maps of Meaning.[10][4][11] To promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour.[45][46][47] As part of the tour, Peterson was interviewed in the UK by Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News which generated considerable attention, as well as popularity for the book.[48][49][50][51] The book topped bestselling lists in Canada, the US, and the United Kingdom.[52][53] As of January 2019, Peterson is working on a sequel to 12 Rules for Life.[54] In 2013, Peterson began recording his lectures (\"Personality and Its Transformations\", \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\"[55]) and uploading them to YouTube. His YouTube channel has gathered more than 1.8 million subscribers and his videos have received more than 65 million views as of August 2018.[37][56] In January 2017, he hired a production team to film his psychology lectures at the University of Toronto. He used funds received on the crowdfunding website Patreon after he became embroiled in the Bill C-16 controversy in September 2016. His funding through Patreon has increased from $1,000 per month in August 2016 to $14,000 by January 2017, more than $50,000 by July 2017, and over $80,000 by May 2018.[29][37][57][58] In December 2018, Peterson decided to delete his Patreon account after Patreon's bans of political personalities who were violating Patreon's terms of service regarding hate speech.[59][60] Peterson has appeared on many podcasts, conversational series, as well other online shows.[56][61] In December 2016, Peterson started his own podcast, The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast, which has included academic guests such as Camille Paglia, Martin Daly, and James W. Pennebaker.[62] On his YouTube channel he has interviewed Stephen Hicks, Richard J. Haier, and Jonathan Haidt among others.[62] In March 2019, the podcast joined the Westwood One network with Peterson's daughter as a co-host on some episodes.[63] Peterson supported engineer James Damore in his action against Google.[11] In May 2017, Peterson began The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,[64] a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in Book of Genesis as patterns of behavior ostensibly vital for personal, social and cultural stability.[11] In March 2019, Peterson had his invitation of a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University rescinded. He had previously said that the fellowship would give him \"the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months\", and that the new lectures would have been on Book of Exodus.[65] A spokesperson for the University said that there was \"no place\" for anyone who could not uphold the \"inclusive environment\" of the university.[66] After a week, the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope explained that it was due to a photograph with a man wearing an Islamophobic shirt.[67] The Cambridge student union released a statement of relief, considering the invitation \"a political act to ... legitimise figures such as Peterson\" and that his work and views are not \"representative of the student body\".[68] Peterson called the decision a \"deeply unfortunate ... error of judgement\" and expressed regret that the Divinity Faculty had submitted to an \"ill-informed, ignorant and ideologically-addled mob\".[69][70] In 2005, Peterson and his colleagues set up a for-profit company to provide and produce a writing therapy program with a series of online writing exercises.[71] Titled the Self Authoring Suite,[25] it includes the Past Authoring Program (a guided autobiography); two Present Authoring Programs which allow the participant to analyze their personality faults and virtues in terms of the Big Five personality model; and the Future Authoring Program which guides participants through the process of planning their desired futures. The latter program was used with McGill University undergraduates on academic probation to improve their grades, as well as since 2011 at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.[72][73] The programs were developed partially from research by James W. Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin and Gary Latham at the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto.[4] Peterson's co-authored 2015 study showed significant reduction in ethnic and gender-group differences in performance, especially among ethnic minority male students.[73][74] According to Peterson, more than 10,000 students have used the program as of January 2017, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and GPAs rising by 20%.[25] Peterson has characterized himself as a \"classic British liberal\",[32][75][76] and as a \"traditionalist\".[77] He has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right wing,[56] as, for example, The New York Times has described Peterson as \"conservative-leaning\",[78] and The Washington Post has described him as \"conservative\".[79] Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Yoram Hazony stated, \"The startling success of his elevated arguments for the importance of order has made him the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the English-speaking world in a generation.\"[80] Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs opines that Peterson has been seen \"as everything from a fascist apologist to an Enlightenment liberal, because his vacuous words are a kind of Rorschach test onto which countless interpretations can be projected.\"[81] Prominent libertarian socialist intellectual Noam Chomsky has agreed with Robinson's criticism, although he described Peterson as \"far on the right\".[82] Peterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as postmodernism, postmodern feminism, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism.[61][83] Writing in the National Post, Chris Selley said Peterson's opponents had \"underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions\",[84] while in The Spectator, Tim Lott stated Peterson became \"an outspoken critic of mainstream academia\".[32] Peterson's social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of The Globe and Mail noted: \"few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won\".[37] According to his study\u2014conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy\u2014of the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: \"PC-egalitarianism\" and \"PC-authoritarianism\", which is a manifestation of \"offense sensitivity\".[85] Jason McBride claims Peterson places classical liberals in the first type, and places so-called social justice warriors, who he says \"weaponize compassion\", in the second.[25][2] The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians.[85] Peterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe.[37] According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s. In his view the humanities have become corrupt and less reliant on science. Instead of \"intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological conversation\". From his own experience as a professor, he states that the students who are coming to his classes are uneducated about and unaware of the mass exterminations and other crimes against humanity perpetrated by Stalinism and Maoism, which were not given the same attention as fascism and Nazism. He also says that \"instead of being ennobled or inculcated into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from [the students] by post-modernism and neo-Marxism, which defines everything in terms of relativism and power\".[32][86][87] \u2014\u00a0Peterson, 2017[86] Peterson says that postmodern philosophers and sociologists since the 1960s[83] have built upon and extended certain core tenets of Marxism and communism while simultaneously appearing to disavow both ideologies. He says that it is difficult to understand contemporary Western society without considering the influence of a strain of postmodernist thought that migrated from France to the United States through the English department at Yale University. He states that certain academics in the humanities:[86] ... started to play a sleight of hand, and instead of pitting the proletariat, the working class, against the bourgeois, they started to pit the oppressed against the oppressor. That opened up the avenue to identifying any number of groups as oppressed and oppressor and to continue the same narrative under a different name.... The people who hold this doctrine\u2013this radical, postmodern, communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity or some kind of group identity paramount\u2013they've got control over most low-to-mid level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well. Peterson's perspective on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments has been compared to Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories.[50][88][89][90] Peterson says that \"disciplines like women's studies should be defunded\" and advises freshman students to avoid subjects like sociology, anthropology, English literature, ethnic studies, and racial studies, as well as other fields of study he believes are corrupted by the neo-Marxist ideology.[91][92][93] He says that these fields, under the pretense of academic inquiry, propagate unscientific methods, fraudulent peer-review processes for academic journals, publications that garner zero citations,[94] cult-like behaviour,[92] safe-spaces,[91] and radical left-wing political activism for students.[83] Peterson has proposed launching a website which uses artificial intelligence to identify and showcase the amount of ideologization in specific courses. He announced in November 2017 that he had temporarily postponed the project as \"it might add excessively to current polarization\".[95][96] Peterson has criticized the use of the term \"white privilege\", stating that \"being called out on their white privilege, identified with a particular racial group and then made to suffer the consequences of the existence of that racial group and its hypothetical crimes, and that sort of thing has to come to a stop.\u00a0... [It's] racist in its extreme\".[83] In regard to identity politics, while the \"left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride\", he considers them \"equally dangerous\" and that what should be emphasized instead are individualism and individual responsibility.[97] He has also been prominent in the debate about cultural appropriation, stating the concept promotes self-censorship in society and journalism.[98] On September 27, 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled \"Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law\".[29][14] In the video, he stated he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech, and announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, which proposed to add \"gender identity or expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the hate speech laws in Canada.[14][99] He stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free-speech implications if the Criminal Code is amended, as he claimed he could then be prosecuted under provincial human-rights laws if he refuses to call a transgender student or faculty member by the individual's preferred pronoun.[15] Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed \"directly or indirectly\" as offensive, \"whether intentionally or unintentionally\".[16] Other academics and lawyers challenged Peterson's interpretation of C-16.[15] The series of videos drew criticism from transgender activists, faculty, and labour unions; critics accused Peterson of \"helping to foster a climate for hate to thrive\" and of \"fundamentally mischaracterising\" the law.[100][29] Protests erupted on campus, some including violence, and the controversy attracted international media attention.[101][102][103] When asked in September 2016 if he would comply with the request of a student to use a preferred pronoun, Peterson said \"it would depend on how they asked me\u00a0[...] If I could detect that there was a chip on their shoulder, or that they were [asking me] with political motives, then I would probably say no\u00a0[...] If I could have a conversation like the one we're having now, I could probably meet them on an equal level\".[103] Two months later, the National Post published an op-ed by Peterson in which he elaborated on his opposition to the bill and explained why he publicly made a stand against it: I will never use words I hate, like the trendy and artificially constructed words \"zhe\" and \"zher.\" These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century. I have been studying authoritarianism on the right and the left for 35 years. I wrote a book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, on the topic, which explores how ideologies hijack language and belief. As a result of my studies, I have come to believe that Marxism is a murderous ideology. I believe its practitioners in modern universities should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to promote such vicious, untenable and anti-human ideas, and for indoctrinating their students with these beliefs. I am therefore not going to mouth Marxist words. That would make me a puppet of the radical left, and that is not going to happen. Period.[104] In response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him that he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto.[105][29] In February 2017, Maxime Bernier, candidate for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, stated that he shifted his position on Bill C-16, from support to opposition, after meeting with Peterson and discussing it.[106] Peterson's analysis of the bill was also frequently cited by senators who were opposed to its passage.[107] In April 2017, Peterson was denied a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant for the first time in his career, which he interpreted as retaliation for his statements regarding Bill C-16.[36] A media-relations adviser for SSHRC said, \"Committees assess only the information contained in the application.\"[108] In response, The Rebel Media launched an Indiegogo campaign on Peterson's behalf.[109] The campaign raised C$195,000 by its end on May 6, equivalent to over two years of research funding.[110] In May 2017, Peterson spoke against Bill C-16 at a Canadian Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing. He was one of 24 witnesses who were invited to speak about the bill.[107] In November 2017, Lindsay Shepherd, the teaching assistant in a Wilfrid Laurier University first-year communications course, was censured by her professors for showing a segment of The Agenda, which featured Peterson debating Bill C-16 with another professor, during a classroom discussion about pronouns.[111][112][113] The reasons given for the censure included the clip creating a \"toxic climate\", being compared to a \"speech by Hitler\",[30] and being itself in violation of Bill C-16.[114] The censure was later withdrawn and both the professors and the university formally apologized.[115][116][117] The events were criticized by Peterson, as well as several newspaper editorial boards[118][119][120] and national newspaper columnists[121][122][123][124] as an example of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. In June 2018, Peterson filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier University, arguing that three staff members of the university had maliciously defamed him by making negative comments about him behind closed doors.[125] As of September\u00a02018,[update] Wilfrid Laurier had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that it was ironic for a purported advocate of free speech to attempt to curtail free speech.[126] Peterson has argued that there is an ongoing \"crisis of masculinity\" and \"backlash against masculinity\" in which the \"masculine spirit is under assault\".[24][127][128][129] He has argued that feminism and policies such as no-fault divorce have had adverse effects on gender relations and have destabilized society.[127] He has argued that the left characterises the existing societal hierarchy as an \"oppressive patriarchy\" but \"don\u2019t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.\"[24] Peterson has said that men without partners are likely to become violent, and has noted that male violence is reduced in societies wherein monogamy is a social norm.[24][127] He has attributed the rise of Donald Trump and far-right European politicians to what he says is a negative reaction to a push to \"feminize\" men, saying \"If men are pushed too hard to feminize they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.\"[130] He attracted considerable attention over a 2018 Channel 4 interview where he clashed with interviewer Cathy Newman on the topic of the gender pay gap.[131][132] Peterson disputed the contention that the disparity was solely due to sexual discrimination.[132][133][134] Peterson doubts the scientific consensus on climate change,[135][136] saying he is \"very skeptical of the models that are used to predict climate change,\"[137] and that \"[y]ou can't trust the data because too much ideology is involved\".[136][138] Peterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989.[29] They have one daughter and one son.[25][29] In a 2017 interview, Peterson was asked if he was a Christian; he responded, \"I suppose the most straight-forward answer to that is yes\".[139] When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: \"I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist\".[10] Writing for The Spectator, Tim Lott said Peterson draws inspiration from Jung's philosophy of religion and holds views similar to the Christian existentialism of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Lott also said that Peterson has respect for Taoism, as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos and posits that life would be meaningless without this duality.[32] Starting around 2000, Peterson began collecting Soviet-era paintings.[30] The paintings are displayed in his house as a reminder of the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror.[4][38] In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a Kwakwaka'wakw artist, and was given the name Alestalagie ('Great Seeker').[30][140] In late 2016, Peterson went on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables to control severe depression and an autoimmune disorder, including psoriasis and uveitis.[26][141] In mid 2018 he stopped eating vegetables, and continued eating only beef (see carnivore diet).[142] In 2019, Peterson entered a rehabilitation facility after experiencing symptoms of physical withdrawal when he stopped taking clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug. He had begun taking the drug upon his doctor's recommendation following his wife's cancer diagnosis.[143][144][145]",

His main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology,[1] with a particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief[2] and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.[3]\nPeterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. He was a post-doctoral fellow at McGill from 1991 to 1993 before moving to Harvard University, where he was an assistant professor in the psychology department.[4][5] In 1998, he returned to Canada to become a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, where he eventually became a full professor.[6]\nPeterson's first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide.[7][8][9] His second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, was published in January 2018.[4][10][11]\nIn 2016, Peterson released a series[12] of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian government's Bill C-16, \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The act added \"gender identity and expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination,[a][13] which Peterson characterised as an introduction of compelled speech into law,[14][15][16] although legal experts have disagreed.[17] He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.[4][10][11] Several writers have associated Peterson with an \"Intellectual Dark Web\".[18][19][20][21][22]\nPeterson was born on June 12, 1962.[23] He grew up in Fairview, Alberta, a small town northwest of his birthplace (Edmonton).[24] He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher.[25][26] His middle name is Bernt (/\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r\u0259nt/ BAIR-\u0259nt),[27] after his Norwegian great-grandfather.[28]\nWhen Peterson was 13, he was introduced to the writings of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ayn Rand by his school librarian Sandy Notley (the mother of Rachel Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th Premier of Alberta).[29] He worked for the New Democratic Party (NDP) throughout his teenage years, but grew disenchanted with the party. He saw his experience of disillusionment resonating with Orwell's diagnosis, in The Road to Wigan Pier, of \"the intellectual, tweed-wearing middle-class socialist\" who \"didn't like the poor; they just hated the rich\".[25][30] He left the NDP at age 18.[31]\nAfter graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature.[2] He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982.[31] Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe. There he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War, 20th-century European totalitarianism,[2][32] and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,[25] and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[32] He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984.[33] In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.[2][34]\nFrom July 1993 to June 1998,[1] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals.[31] Two former Ph.D. students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students.[4] In July 1998, he returned to Canada and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.[1][33]\nPeterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational,[1] religious, ideological,[2] political, and creativity psychology.[3] Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers[35] and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017.[36]\nFor most of his career, Peterson had an active clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He had been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16.[12][29][37] As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017[10] and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018.[26][38]\nIn June 2018, Peterson debated with Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver while moderated by Bret Weinstein, and again in July at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London while moderated by Douglas Murray, over the topic of religion and God.[39][40] In April 2019, Peterson debated professor Slavoj \u017di\u017eek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.[41][42]\nIn 1999 Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs and make narratives using ideas from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and psychology in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.[31][5][43]\nAccording to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in social conflict, explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification[31]) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Rwandan genocide.[31][5][43] He considers that an \"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality\".[43] Jungian archetypes play an important role in the book.[4]\nIn 2004, a 13-part TV series based on Peterson's book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief aired on TVOntario.[25][33][44]\nIn January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. The work contains abstract ethical principles about life, in a more accessible style than Maps of Meaning.[10][4][11]\nTo promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour.[45][46][47] As part of the tour, Peterson was interviewed in the UK by Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News which generated considerable attention, as well as popularity for the book.[48][49][50][51] The book topped bestselling lists in Canada, the US, and the United Kingdom.[52][53] As of January 2019, Peterson is working on a sequel to 12 Rules for Life.[54]\nIn 2013, Peterson began recording his lectures (\"Personality and Its Transformations\", \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\"[55]) and uploading them to YouTube. His YouTube channel has gathered more than 1.8 million subscribers and his videos have received more than 65 million views as of August 2018.[37][56] In January 2017, he hired a production team to film his psychology lectures at the University of Toronto. He used funds received on the crowdfunding website Patreon after he became embroiled in the Bill C-16 controversy in September 2016. His funding through Patreon has increased from $1,000 per month in August 2016 to $14,000 by January 2017, more than $50,000 by July 2017, and over $80,000 by May 2018.[29][37][57][58] In December 2018, Peterson decided to delete his Patreon account after Patreon's bans of political personalities who were violating Patreon's terms of service regarding hate speech.[59][60]\nPeterson has appeared on many podcasts, conversational series, as well other online shows.[56][61] In December 2016, Peterson started his own podcast, The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast, which has included academic guests such as Camille Paglia, Martin Daly, and James W. Pennebaker.[62] On his YouTube channel he has interviewed Stephen Hicks, Richard J. Haier, and Jonathan Haidt among others.[62] In March 2019, the podcast joined the Westwood One network with Peterson's daughter as a co-host on some episodes.[63] Peterson supported engineer James Damore in his action against Google.[11]\nIn May 2017, Peterson began The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,[64] a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in Book of Genesis as patterns of behavior ostensibly vital for personal, social and cultural stability.[11]\nIn March 2019, Peterson had his invitation of a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University rescinded. He had previously said that the fellowship would give him \"the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months\", and that the new lectures would have been on Book of Exodus.[65] A spokesperson for the University said that there was \"no place\" for anyone who could not uphold the \"inclusive environment\" of the university.[66] After a week, the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope explained that it was due to a photograph with a man wearing an Islamophobic shirt.[67] The Cambridge student union released a statement of relief, considering the invitation \"a political act to ... legitimise figures such as Peterson\" and that his work and views are not \"representative of the student body\".[68] Peterson called the decision a \"deeply unfortunate ... error of judgement\" and expressed regret that the Divinity Faculty had submitted to an \"ill-informed, ignorant and ideologically-addled mob\".[69][70]\nIn 2005, Peterson and his colleagues set up a for-profit company to provide and produce a writing therapy program with a series of online writing exercises.[71] Titled the Self Authoring Suite,[25] it includes the Past Authoring Program (a guided autobiography); two Present Authoring Programs which allow the participant to analyze their personality faults and virtues in terms of the Big Five personality model; and the Future Authoring Program which guides participants through the process of planning their desired futures. The latter program was used with McGill University undergraduates on academic probation to improve their grades, as well as since 2011 at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.[72][73] The programs were developed partially from research by James W. Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin and Gary Latham at the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto.[4] Peterson's co-authored 2015 study showed significant reduction in ethnic and gender-group differences in performance, especially among ethnic minority male students.[73][74] According to Peterson, more than 10,000 students have used the program as of January 2017, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and GPAs rising by 20%.[25]\nPeterson has characterized himself as a \"classic British liberal\",[32][75][76] and as a \"traditionalist\".[77] He has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right wing,[56] as, for example, The New York Times has described Peterson as \"conservative-leaning\",[78] and The Washington Post has described him as \"conservative\".[79] Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Yoram Hazony stated, \"The startling success of his elevated arguments for the importance of order has made him the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the English-speaking world in a generation.\"[80] Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs opines that Peterson has been seen \"as everything from a fascist apologist to an Enlightenment liberal, because his vacuous words are a kind of Rorschach test onto which countless interpretations can be projected.\"[81] Prominent libertarian socialist intellectual Noam Chomsky has agreed with Robinson's criticism, although he described Peterson as \"far on the right\".[82]\nPeterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as postmodernism, postmodern feminism, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism.[61][83]\nWriting in the National Post, Chris Selley said Peterson's opponents had \"underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions\",[84] while in The Spectator, Tim Lott stated Peterson became \"an outspoken critic of mainstream academia\".[32] Peterson's social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of The Globe and Mail noted: \"few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won\".[37]\nAccording to his study\u2014conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy\u2014of the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: \"PC-egalitarianism\" and \"PC-authoritarianism\", which is a manifestation of \"offense sensitivity\".[85] Jason McBride claims Peterson places classical liberals in the first type, and places so-called social justice warriors, who he says \"weaponize compassion\", in the second.[25][2] The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians.[85]\nPeterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe.[37] According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s.  In his view the humanities  have become corrupt and less reliant on science. Instead of \"intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological  conversation\". From his own experience as a  professor, he states that the students who are coming to his classes are uneducated about and unaware of the mass exterminations and other crimes against humanity perpetrated by Stalinism and Maoism, which were not given the same attention as fascism and Nazism. He also says that \"instead of being ennobled or inculcated into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from [the students] by post-modernism and neo-Marxism, which defines everything in terms of relativism and power\".[32][86][87]\n \u2014\u00a0Peterson, 2017[86]\nPeterson says that postmodern philosophers and sociologists since the 1960s[83] have built upon and extended certain core tenets of Marxism and communism while simultaneously appearing to disavow both ideologies. He says that it is difficult to understand contemporary Western society without considering the influence of a strain of postmodernist thought that migrated from France to the United States through the English department at Yale University. He states that certain academics in the humanities:[86]\n... started to play a sleight of hand, and instead of pitting the proletariat, the working class, against the bourgeois, they started to pit the oppressed against the oppressor. That opened up the avenue to identifying any number of groups as oppressed and oppressor and to continue the same narrative under a different name.... The people who hold this doctrine\u2013this radical, postmodern, communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity or some kind of group identity paramount\u2013they've got control over most low-to-mid level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well.\nPeterson's perspective on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments has been compared to Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories.[50][88][89][90]\nPeterson says that \"disciplines like women's studies should be defunded\" and advises freshman students to avoid subjects like sociology, anthropology, English literature, ethnic studies, and racial studies, as well as other fields of study he believes are corrupted by the neo-Marxist ideology.[91][92][93] He says that these fields, under the pretense of academic inquiry, propagate unscientific methods, fraudulent peer-review processes for academic journals, publications that garner zero citations,[94] cult-like behaviour,[92] safe-spaces,[91] and radical left-wing political activism for students.[83] Peterson has proposed launching a website which uses artificial intelligence to identify and showcase the amount of ideologization in specific courses. He announced in November 2017 that he had temporarily postponed the project as \"it might add excessively to current polarization\".[95][96]\nPeterson has criticized the use of the term \"white privilege\", stating that \"being called out on their white privilege, identified with a particular racial group and then made to suffer the consequences of the existence of that racial group and its hypothetical crimes, and that sort of thing has to come to a stop.\u00a0... [It's] racist in its extreme\".[83] In regard to identity politics, while the \"left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride\", he considers them \"equally dangerous\" and that what should be emphasized instead are individualism and individual responsibility.[97] He has also been prominent in the debate about cultural appropriation, stating the concept promotes self-censorship in society and journalism.[98]\nOn September 27, 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled \"Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law\".[29][14] In the video, he stated he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech, and announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, which proposed to add \"gender identity or expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the hate speech laws in Canada.[14][99]\nHe stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free-speech implications if the Criminal Code is amended, as he claimed he could then be prosecuted under provincial human-rights laws if he refuses to call a transgender student or faculty member by the individual's preferred pronoun.[15] Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed \"directly or indirectly\" as offensive, \"whether intentionally or unintentionally\".[16] Other academics and lawyers challenged Peterson's interpretation of C-16.[15]\nThe series of videos drew criticism from transgender activists, faculty, and labour unions; critics accused Peterson of \"helping to foster a climate for hate to thrive\" and of \"fundamentally mischaracterising\" the law.[100][29] Protests erupted on campus, some including violence, and the controversy attracted international media attention.[101][102][103] When asked in September 2016 if he would comply with the request of a student to use a preferred pronoun, Peterson said \"it would depend on how they asked me\u00a0[...] If I could detect that there was a chip on their shoulder, or that they were [asking me] with political motives, then I would probably say no\u00a0[...] If I could have a conversation like the one we're having now, I could probably meet them on an equal level\".[103] Two months later, the National Post published an op-ed by Peterson in which he elaborated on his opposition to the bill and explained why he publicly made a stand against it:\nI will never use words I hate, like the trendy and artificially constructed words \"zhe\" and \"zher.\" These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century.\nI have been studying authoritarianism on the right and the left for 35 years. I wrote a book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, on the topic, which explores how ideologies hijack language and belief. As a result of my studies, I have come to believe that Marxism is a murderous ideology. I believe its practitioners in modern universities should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to promote such vicious, untenable and anti-human ideas, and for indoctrinating their students with these beliefs. I am therefore not going to mouth Marxist words. That would make me a puppet of the radical left, and that is not going to happen. Period.[104]\nIn response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him that he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto.[105][29]\nIn February 2017, Maxime Bernier, candidate for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, stated that he shifted his position on Bill C-16, from support to opposition, after meeting with Peterson and discussing it.[106] Peterson's analysis of the bill was also frequently cited by senators who were opposed to its passage.[107] In April 2017, Peterson was denied a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant for the first time in his career, which he interpreted as retaliation for his statements regarding Bill C-16.[36] A media-relations adviser for SSHRC said, \"Committees assess only the information contained in the application.\"[108] In response, The Rebel Media launched an Indiegogo campaign on Peterson's behalf.[109] The campaign raised C$195,000 by its end on May 6, equivalent to over two years of research funding.[110] In May 2017, Peterson spoke against Bill C-16 at a Canadian Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing. He was one of 24 witnesses who were invited to speak about the bill.[107]\nIn November 2017, Lindsay Shepherd, the teaching assistant in a Wilfrid Laurier University first-year communications course, was censured by her professors for showing a segment of The Agenda, which featured Peterson debating Bill C-16 with another professor, during a classroom discussion about pronouns.[111][112][113] The reasons given for the censure included the clip creating a \"toxic climate\", being compared to a \"speech by Hitler\",[30] and being itself in violation of Bill C-16.[114] The censure was later withdrawn and both the professors and the university formally apologized.[115][116][117] The events were criticized by Peterson, as well as several newspaper editorial boards[118][119][120] and national newspaper columnists[121][122][123][124] as an example of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. In June 2018, Peterson filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier University, arguing that three staff members of the university had maliciously defamed him by making negative comments about him behind closed doors.[125] As of September\u00a02018,[update] Wilfrid Laurier had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that it was ironic for a purported advocate of free speech to attempt to curtail free speech.[126]\nPeterson has argued that there is an ongoing \"crisis of masculinity\" and \"backlash against masculinity\" in which the \"masculine spirit is under assault\".[24][127][128][129] He has argued that feminism and policies such as no-fault divorce have had adverse effects on gender relations and have destabilized society.[127] He has argued that the left characterises the existing societal hierarchy as an \"oppressive patriarchy\" but \"don\u2019t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.\"[24] Peterson has said that men without partners are likely to become violent, and has noted that male violence is reduced in societies wherein monogamy is a social norm.[24][127] He has attributed the rise of Donald Trump and far-right European politicians to what he says is a negative reaction to a push to \"feminize\" men, saying \"If men are pushed too hard to feminize they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.\"[130] He attracted considerable attention over a 2018 Channel 4 interview where he clashed with interviewer Cathy Newman on the topic of the gender pay gap.[131][132] Peterson disputed the contention that the disparity was solely due to sexual discrimination.[132][133][134]\nPeterson doubts the scientific consensus on climate change,[135][136] saying he is \"very skeptical of the models that are used to predict climate change,\"[137] and that \"[y]ou can't trust the data because too much ideology is involved\".[136][138]\nPeterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989.[29] They have one daughter and one son.[25][29]\nIn a 2017 interview, Peterson was asked if he was a Christian; he responded, \"I suppose the most straight-forward answer to that is yes\".[139] When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: \"I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist\".[10] Writing for The Spectator, Tim Lott said Peterson draws inspiration from Jung's philosophy of religion and holds views similar to the Christian existentialism of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Lott also said that Peterson has respect for Taoism, as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos and posits that life would be meaningless without this duality.[32]\nStarting around 2000, Peterson began collecting Soviet-era paintings.[30] The paintings are displayed in his house as a reminder of the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror.[4][38] In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a Kwakwaka'wakw artist, and was given the name Alestalagie ('Great Seeker').[30][140]\nIn late 2016, Peterson went on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables to control severe depression and an autoimmune disorder, including psoriasis and uveitis.[26][141] In mid 2018 he stopped eating vegetables, and continued eating only beef (see carnivore diet).[142] In 2019, Peterson entered a rehabilitation facility after experiencing symptoms of physical withdrawal when he stopped taking clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug. He had begun taking the drug upon his doctor's recommendation following his wife's cancer diagnosis.[143][144][145]\n</body></html>"

Lopez signed with WWE in 2010 and was sent to its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) where he was renamed Seth Rollins and became the inaugural FCW Grand Slam Champion. After WWE rebranded FCW into NXT, he became the inaugural NXT Champion. Alongside Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, he debuted on WWE's main roster at the 2012 Survivor Series as part of a faction called The Shield. He won his first main roster championship while with the group, the WWE Tag Team Championship with Reigns. Following the team's first breakup in June 2014, Rollins went on to become a two-time WWE Champion, two-time Universal Champion, two-time Intercontinental Champion, one-time United States Champion, record six-time WWE/Raw Tag Team Champion (with Reigns, Ambrose (twice), Jason Jordan, Braun Strowman and Buddy Murphy), the 2014 Money in the Bank winner, the 2015 Superstar of the Year and the 2019 Men's Royal Rumble winner. Prior to signing with WWE, Lopez wrestled under the ring name Tyler Black for Ring of Honor (ROH), where he held the ROH World Championship once and the ROH World Tag Team Championship twice (with Jimmy Jacobs), as well as the winner of the 2009 Survival of the Fittest tournament. He also wrestled for various independent promotions including Full Impact Pro (FIP), where he was a one-time FIP World Heavyweight Champion, as well as Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), where he was a one-time PWG World Tag Team Champion (also with Jacobs). Upon capturing the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in 2015, and after winning his first Intercontinental Championship, he became the 29th Triple Crown Champion and the 18th Grand Slam Champion. He is the only wrestler to have held all three of WWE's main brand world titles (WWE, Universal, and NXT Championships). Rollins has headlined numerous major pay-per-view events for WWE, including WrestleMania 31. Industry veteran Sting, who wrestled his final match against Rollins, described him as the most talented professional wrestler he has ever seen or worked with.[6] He was the cover athlete for video game WWE 2K18.[7] He has been named the No. 1 wrestler in the world by Pro Wrestling Illustrated's PWI 500 list in both 2015 and 2019. Colby Lopez was born on May 28, 1986, in Buffalo, Iowa.[1][8] He is of Armenian, German, and Irish descent.[4][9][10] His surname, Lopez, comes from his Mexican-American stepfather, who is also the father of his older brother Brandon, as seen in WWE 24.[4] He graduated from Davenport West High School in 2004.[1] As a teenager, he was an introvert and a big fan of rock and heavy metal music who lived a straight edge lifestyle.[11] Rollins trained at a wrestling school owned by Danny Daniels on the border of Chicago and Oak Park, Illinois.[4] Lopez made his debut in 2005, wrestling in the Iowa independent scene under the ring name Gixx.[5][12] He then joined Ian Rotten's Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA) under the name Tyler Black, and entered the Ted Petty Invitational Tournament, defeating Sal Thomaselli before being eliminated by Matt Sydal in the quarterfinals in Hammond, Indiana on September 23, 2005.[13] He soon joined NWA Midwest and won the promotion's tag team championship with Marek Brave. The two successfully defended the NWA Midwest Tag Team Championship against Ryan Boz and Danny Daniels, Brett Wayne and Hype Gotti and Jayson Reign and Marco Cordova several times in early 2006.[14] He briefly appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and teamed with Jeff Luxon in a loss to The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez) on Impact! in October 2006.[15] On May 25, 2007, while in a match with then Full Impact Pro (FIP) Tag Team Champions The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) in Melbourne, Florida, Black's tag team partner Marek Brave suffered a legitimate back injury,[16] leading Black to pursue a singles career by competing in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), where he defeated Joey Ryan in his debut on June 10.[17] At PWG's Life During Wartime on July 6, 2008, Black teamed with Jimmy Jacobs to win the PWG World Tag Team Championship by defeating Roderick Strong and El Generico, who was a replacement for Jack Evans.[18][19] At FIP's event on December 20, Black defeated Go Shiozaki to win the FIP World Heavyweight Championship.[20] At FIP's event on May 2, 2009, Davey Richards was awarded the FIP World Heavyweight Championship by forfeit when Black was unable to compete.[20] At the Ring of Honor (ROH) pay-per-view taping of Man Up in September 2007, Black made his debut, alongside Jimmy Jacobs and Necro Butcher, with the three attacking The Briscoe Brothers, and hanging Jay Briscoe from light rigging fashioned as a noose. The three formed a stable called The Age of the Fall.[21] The angle was so controversial that ROH decided to remove the footage from the pay-per-view that was being taped at the event.[12] Black later made his ROH in-ring debut later that night in a dark match, wrestling Jack Evans to a no contest.[12] At Glory by Honor VI in November, Black defeated Alex \"Sugarfoot\" Payne, but was attacked by The Briscoe Brothers following the match.[22] He appeared with The Age of the Fall in their match against The Briscoe Brothers during the main event.[23] At Final Battle in December, Black and Jacobs defeated The Briscoe Brothers to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship.[24] They lost the championship one month later on January 26, 2008 to the No Remorse Corps (Davey Richards and Rocky Romero) when competing in an Ultimate Endurance match also involving The Hangmen 3 (Brent Albright and BJ Whitmer), and the team of Austin Aries and Bryan Danielson.[24] At Take No Prisoners, ROH's sixth pay-per-view, Black challenged Nigel McGuinness for the ROH World Championship in a losing effort.[25] At Up For Grabs, Black and Jacobs won an eight-team tournament to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship for a second time.[24] The two lost the championship at Driven to the team of Kevin Steen and El Generico.[24] Black had a second chance at the ROH World Championship at Death Before Dishonor VI in New York City, when he faced McGuinness, Danielson and Claudio Castagnoli in a four-way elimination match, but McGuinness retained the title.[25] At Final Battle in December 2008, after Black lost a number one contender match to Austin Aries, Jacobs turned on him, and Black was then attacked by Aries.[25] At Full Circle, Black was given a non-title match against then-ROH World Champion Nigel McGuinness on January 16, 2009 where Black was victorious.[26] The following night, Black faced McGuinness in a title match, which ended in a time limit draw.[26] On June 26 at Violent Tendencies, Black defeated Jimmy Jacobs in a steel cage match to end their feud.[26] In September 2009, Black took a hiatus after receiving surgery on his neck.[27] On October 10, Black defeated Kenny King in a first-round match and then Claudio Castagnoli, Colt Cabana, Delirious, Chris Hero and Roderick Strong in the finals to win the 2009 Survival of the Fittest tournament, which earned him a match for the ROH World Championship.[28] On December 19 at Final Battle 2009, ROH's first live pay-per-view, Black wrestled then ROH World Champion Austin Aries to a 60-minute time limit draw.[29] Because of this draw, then ROH commissioner Jim Cornette booked the two in a rematch between February 13, 2010 for the company's Eighth Anniversary Show. The booking saw Cornette set up a judging panel with himself on and one person picked by each competitor, in order for there to be a decisive winner in case of another draw. Aries picked Kenny King while Black picked Roderick Strong,[30] whom he guaranteed an ROH World Championship title shot should he win. At the event, Black pinned Aries to win the ROH World Championship.[31][32] On April 3, Black retained the title in a three-way elimination match against Austin Aries and Roderick Strong at The Big Bang! pay-per-view.[33] He also retained the title on June 19 at the following pay-per-view, Death Before Dishonor VIII, in a match against Davey Richards.[34] Black turned into a villain at the August 20 tapings of Ring of Honor Wrestling after news broke that he had signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).[35] He threatened to take the ROH World Championship with him to WWE and refused to put the championship at stake in a match with Davey Richards on August 28 which he then lost by submission.[35][36] On September 11 at Glory By Honor IX, in his final ROH appearance, Black lost the ROH World Championship to Roderick Strong in a no disqualification match with Terry Funk as a guest enforcer, ending his reign at 210 days after seven successful title defenses.[37] On August 8, Lopez signed a developmental contract with WWE and was assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in September.[38][39][40] On September 14, Black made his WWE debut in a dark match prior to the SmackDown taping by defeating Trent Barreta.[41] Lopez debuted for FCW on September 30 under the name Seth Rollins, in a loss to Michael McGillicutty.[2][42] Rollins then faced Hunico on November 4 in the first ever FCW 15 match under 15-minute Iron Man rules[43] where they fought to a 1-1 draw.[44] Following this, Rollins, along with Hunico, Richie Steamboat and Jinder Mahal, participated in the FCW 15 Jack Brisco Classic tournament.[43] On January 13, 2011, Rollins defeated Hunico in the finals to win the tournament and became the inaugural FCW Jack Brisco 15 Champion.[43][45] On March 25 at a house show, Rollins and Richie Steamboat defeated Damien Sandow and Titus O'Neil win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship.[46] Rollins and Steamboat eventually lost the championship to Big E Langston and Calvin Raines.[47] In July 2011, Rollins began a feud with Dean Ambrose.[48] Ambrose and Rollins had their first match for the FCW 15 Championship in a 15-minute Iron Man match on the August 14 episode of FCW, which ended in a draw with neither men scoring a fall and, as a result, Rollins retained his title.[49] A subsequent 20-minute rematch for the title two weeks later resulted in a similar 0-0 draw.[49] A second 30-minute rematch for the title on the September 18 episode of FCW went to a time limit 2-2 draw and the match was sent into sudden death overtime, where Rollins scored a pinfall to win the match 3-2.[49] On September 22, Rollins lost the FCW 15 Championship to Damien Sandow by disqualification after Ambrose attacked Sandow late in the match.[50][51] On February 23, 2012, Rollins defeated Leo Kruger to become the new FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion.[52] Rollins lost the championship to Rick Victor at a house show on May 31.[53] When WWE rebranded FCW into NXT in August 2012,[54] Rollins' NXT TV debut took place on the second episode of the rebooted NXT at Full Sail University on June 27, when he defeated Jiro.[55][56] Rollins entered the Gold Rush Tournament to crown the inaugural NXT Champion where he defeated Jinder Mahal in the tournament finals on the August 29 episode of NXT.[57][58] On the October 10 episode of NXT, Rollins had his first successful defense of his title after he beat Michael McGillicutty.[59] On the January 2, 2013 episode of NXT, Rollins successfully defended the NXT Championship against Corey Graves,[60] before losing it the next week on NXT to Big E Langston in a No Disqualification match.[61] After losing the title, Rollins continued to feud with Graves and attacked him during his number one contender's match for the NXT Championship with Conor O'Brian.[62] Rollins then accepted Graves' challenge[63] and defeated him in a lumberjack match to end the feud.[64] On November 18, 2012, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view event, Rollins made his main roster debut as a heel alongside Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, attacking Ryback during the triple threat main event for the WWE Championship, allowing CM Punk to pin John Cena and retain the title.[65] The trio declared themselves The Shield, vowed to rally against \"injustice\" and denied working for Punk,[66][67] but they routinely emerged from the crowd to attack Punk's adversaries.[68][69] This led to a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match being set up for the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pay-per-view event, where Ambrose, Rollins and Reigns defeated Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane) and Ryback in their WWE debut match.[70] The Shield continued to aid Punk after TLC, attacking both Ryback and The Rock in January 2013.[71][72] It was revealed on the January 28 episode of Raw that Punk and his manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield and Brad Maddox to work for them all along.[73] The Shield then quietly ended their association with Punk while beginning a feud with John Cena, Ryback and Sheamus that led to a six-man tag match on February 17 at Elimination Chamber, which The Shield won.[74][75][76] The Shield then faced Sheamus, Big Show and Randy Orton at WrestleMania 29, where The Shield emerged victorious in their first WrestleMania match.[77][78] The following night on Raw, The Shield attempted to attack The Undertaker, but were stopped by Team Hell No.[79] This set up a six-man tag team match on the April 22 episode of Raw, which The Shield won.[80] On the May 13 episode of Raw, The Shield's undefeated streak in televised six-man tag team matches ended in a disqualification loss in a six-man elimination tag team match against John Cena, Kane and Daniel Bryan.[81] On May 19 at Extreme Rules, Rollins and Reigns defeated Team Hell No in a tornado tag team match to win the WWE Tag Team Championship.[82] On the June 14 episode of SmackDown, The Shield suffered their first decisive loss in televised six-man tag team matches against Team Hell No and Randy Orton when Bryan made Rollins submit.[83][84] Rollins and Reigns then successfully retained the WWE Tag Team Championship against Bryan and Orton at Payback on June 13.[85] In August, The Shield began working for Chief operating officer Triple H and The Authority.[86][87] Rollins and Reigns also successfully defended their titles against The Usos during the Money in the Bank pre-show and against The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil) at Night of Champions.[88][89] At Battleground in October, the recently (kayfabe) fired Cody Rhodes and Goldust reclaimed their jobs back by beating Rollins and Reigns in a non-title match.[90] On the October 14 episode of Raw, Rollins and Reigns lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a No Disqualification match following interference from Big Show.[91] At Hell in a Cell on October 27, Rollins and Reigns failed to regain the titles in a triple threat match also involving The Usos.[92] The following month at Survivor Series, The Shield teamed with Antonio Cesaro and Jack Swagger to take on Rey Mysterio, The Usos, Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a traditional Survivor Series match.

After WWE rebranded FCW into NXT, he became the inaugural NXT Champion. Alongside Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, he debuted on WWE's main roster at the 2012 Survivor Series as part of a faction called The Shield. He won his first main roster championship while with the group, the WWE Tag Team Championship with Reigns. Following the team's first breakup in June 2014, Rollins went on to become a two-time WWE Champion, two-time Universal Champion, two-time Intercontinental Champion, one-time United States Champion, record six-time WWE/Raw Tag Team Champion (with Reigns, Ambrose (twice), Jason Jordan, Braun Strowman and Buddy Murphy), the 2014 Money in the Bank winner, the 2015 Superstar of the Year and the 2019 Men's Royal Rumble winner.\nPrior to signing with WWE, Lopez wrestled under the ring name Tyler Black for Ring of Honor (ROH), where he held the ROH World Championship once and the ROH World Tag Team Championship twice (with Jimmy Jacobs), as well as the winner of the 2009 Survival of the Fittest tournament. He also wrestled for various independent promotions including Full Impact Pro (FIP), where he was a one-time FIP World Heavyweight Champion, as well as Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), where he was a one-time PWG World Tag Team Champion (also with Jacobs).\nUpon capturing the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in 2015, and after winning his first Intercontinental Championship, he became the 29th Triple Crown Champion and the 18th Grand Slam Champion. He is the only wrestler to have held all three of WWE's main brand world titles (WWE, Universal, and NXT Championships).\nRollins has headlined numerous major pay-per-view events for WWE, including WrestleMania 31. Industry veteran Sting, who wrestled his final match against Rollins, described him as the most talented professional wrestler he has ever seen or worked with.[6] He was the cover athlete for video game WWE 2K18.[7] He has been named the No. 1 wrestler in the world by Pro Wrestling Illustrated's PWI 500 list in both 2015 and 2019.\nColby Lopez was born on May 28, 1986, in Buffalo, Iowa.[1][8] He is of Armenian, German, and Irish descent.[4][9][10] His surname, Lopez, comes from his Mexican-American stepfather, who is also the father of his older brother Brandon, as seen in WWE 24.[4] He graduated from Davenport West High School in 2004.[1] As a teenager, he was an introvert and a big fan of rock and heavy metal music who lived a straight edge lifestyle.[11] Rollins trained at a wrestling school owned by Danny Daniels on the border of Chicago and Oak Park, Illinois.[4]\nLopez made his debut in 2005, wrestling in the Iowa independent scene under the ring name Gixx.[5][12] He then joined Ian Rotten's Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA) under the name Tyler Black, and entered the Ted Petty Invitational Tournament, defeating Sal Thomaselli before being eliminated by Matt Sydal in the quarterfinals in Hammond, Indiana on September 23, 2005.[13]\nHe soon joined NWA Midwest and won the promotion's tag team championship with Marek Brave. The two successfully defended the NWA Midwest Tag Team Championship against Ryan Boz and Danny Daniels, Brett Wayne and Hype Gotti and Jayson Reign and Marco Cordova several times in early 2006.[14] He briefly appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and teamed with Jeff Luxon in a loss to The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez) on Impact! in October 2006.[15]\nOn May 25, 2007, while in a match with then Full Impact Pro (FIP) Tag Team Champions The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) in Melbourne, Florida, Black's tag team partner Marek Brave suffered a legitimate back injury,[16] leading Black to pursue a singles career by competing in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), where he defeated Joey Ryan in his debut on June 10.[17]\nAt PWG's Life During Wartime on July 6, 2008, Black teamed with Jimmy Jacobs to win the PWG World Tag Team Championship by defeating Roderick Strong and El Generico, who was a replacement for Jack Evans.[18][19] At FIP's event on December 20, Black defeated Go Shiozaki to win the FIP World Heavyweight Championship.[20] At FIP's event on May 2, 2009, Davey Richards was awarded the FIP World Heavyweight Championship by forfeit when Black was unable to compete.[20]\nAt the Ring of Honor (ROH) pay-per-view taping of Man Up in September 2007, Black made his debut, alongside Jimmy Jacobs and Necro Butcher, with the three attacking The Briscoe Brothers, and hanging Jay Briscoe from light rigging fashioned as a noose. The three formed a stable called The Age of the Fall.[21] The angle was so controversial that ROH decided to remove the footage from the pay-per-view that was being taped at the event.[12] Black later made his ROH in-ring debut later that night in a dark match, wrestling Jack Evans to a no contest.[12]\nAt Glory by Honor VI in November, Black defeated Alex \"Sugarfoot\" Payne, but was attacked by The Briscoe Brothers following the match.[22] He appeared with The Age of the Fall in their match against The Briscoe Brothers during the main event.[23] At Final Battle in December, Black and Jacobs defeated The Briscoe Brothers to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship.[24]\nThey lost the championship one month later on January 26, 2008 to the No Remorse Corps (Davey Richards and Rocky Romero) when competing in an Ultimate Endurance match also involving The Hangmen 3 (Brent Albright and BJ Whitmer), and the team of Austin Aries and Bryan Danielson.[24]\nAt Take No Prisoners, ROH's sixth pay-per-view, Black challenged Nigel McGuinness for the ROH World Championship in a losing effort.[25] At Up For Grabs, Black and Jacobs won an eight-team tournament to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship for a second time.[24] The two lost the championship at Driven to the team of Kevin Steen and El Generico.[24] Black had a second chance at the ROH World Championship at Death Before Dishonor VI in New York City, when he faced McGuinness, Danielson and Claudio Castagnoli in a four-way elimination match, but McGuinness retained the title.[25]\nAt Final Battle in December 2008, after Black lost a number one contender match to Austin Aries, Jacobs turned on him, and Black was then attacked by Aries.[25] At Full Circle, Black was given a non-title match against then-ROH World Champion Nigel McGuinness on January 16, 2009 where Black was victorious.[26] The following night, Black faced McGuinness in a title match, which ended in a time limit draw.[26] On June 26 at Violent Tendencies, Black defeated Jimmy Jacobs in a steel cage match to end their feud.[26]\nIn September 2009, Black took a hiatus after receiving surgery on his neck.[27] On October 10, Black defeated Kenny King in a first-round match and then Claudio Castagnoli, Colt Cabana, Delirious, Chris Hero and Roderick Strong in the finals to win the 2009 Survival of the Fittest tournament, which earned him a match for the ROH World Championship.[28] On December 19 at Final Battle 2009, ROH's first live pay-per-view, Black wrestled then ROH World Champion Austin Aries to a 60-minute time limit draw.[29] Because of this draw, then ROH commissioner Jim Cornette booked the two in a rematch between February 13, 2010 for the company's Eighth Anniversary Show. The booking saw Cornette set up a judging panel with himself on and one person picked by each competitor, in order for there to be a decisive winner in case of another draw. Aries picked Kenny King while Black picked Roderick Strong,[30] whom he guaranteed an ROH World Championship title shot should he win. At the event, Black pinned Aries to win the ROH World Championship.[31][32]\nOn April 3, Black retained the title in a three-way elimination match against Austin Aries and Roderick Strong at The Big Bang! pay-per-view.[33] He also retained the title on June 19 at the following pay-per-view, Death Before Dishonor VIII, in a match against Davey Richards.[34] Black turned into a villain at the August 20 tapings of Ring of Honor Wrestling after news broke that he had signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).[35] He threatened to take the ROH World Championship with him to WWE and refused to put the championship at stake in a match with Davey Richards on August 28 which he then lost by submission.[35][36] On September 11 at Glory By Honor IX, in his final ROH appearance, Black lost the ROH World Championship to Roderick Strong in a no disqualification match with Terry Funk as a guest enforcer, ending his reign at 210 days after seven successful title defenses.[37]\nOn August 8, Lopez signed a developmental contract with WWE and was assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in September.[38][39][40] On September 14, Black made his WWE debut in a dark match prior to the SmackDown taping by defeating Trent Barreta.[41]\nLopez debuted for FCW on September 30 under the name Seth Rollins, in a loss to Michael McGillicutty.[2][42] Rollins then faced Hunico on November 4 in the first ever FCW 15 match under 15-minute Iron Man rules[43] where they fought to a 1-1 draw.[44] Following this, Rollins, along with Hunico, Richie Steamboat and Jinder Mahal, participated in the FCW 15 Jack Brisco Classic tournament.[43] On January 13, 2011, Rollins defeated Hunico in the finals to win the tournament and became the inaugural FCW Jack Brisco 15 Champion.[43][45]\nOn March 25 at a house show, Rollins and Richie Steamboat defeated Damien Sandow and Titus O'Neil win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship.[46] Rollins and Steamboat eventually lost the championship to Big E Langston and Calvin Raines.[47]\nIn July 2011, Rollins began a feud with Dean Ambrose.[48] Ambrose and Rollins had their first match for the FCW 15 Championship in a 15-minute Iron Man match on the August 14 episode of FCW, which ended in a draw with neither men scoring a fall and, as a result, Rollins retained his title.[49] A subsequent 20-minute rematch for the title two weeks later resulted in a similar 0-0 draw.[49] A second 30-minute rematch for the title on the September 18 episode of FCW went to a time limit 2-2 draw and the match was sent into sudden death overtime, where Rollins scored a pinfall to win the match 3-2.[49] On September 22, Rollins lost the FCW 15 Championship to Damien Sandow by disqualification after Ambrose attacked Sandow late in the match.[50][51]\nOn February 23, 2012, Rollins defeated Leo Kruger to become the new FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion.[52] Rollins lost the championship to Rick Victor at a house show on May 31.[53]\nWhen WWE rebranded FCW into NXT in August 2012,[54] Rollins' NXT TV debut took place on the second episode of the rebooted NXT at Full Sail University on June 27, when he defeated Jiro.[55][56] Rollins entered the Gold Rush Tournament to crown the inaugural NXT Champion where he defeated Jinder Mahal in the tournament finals on the August 29 episode of NXT.[57][58] On the October 10 episode of NXT, Rollins had his first successful defense of his title after he beat Michael McGillicutty.[59]\nOn the January 2, 2013 episode of NXT, Rollins successfully defended the NXT Championship against Corey Graves,[60] before losing it the next week on NXT to Big E Langston in a No Disqualification match.[61] After losing the title, Rollins continued to feud with Graves and attacked him during his number one contender's match for the NXT Championship with Conor O'Brian.[62] Rollins then accepted Graves' challenge[63] and defeated him in a lumberjack match to end the feud.[64]\nOn November 18, 2012, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view event, Rollins made his main roster debut as a heel alongside Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, attacking Ryback during the triple threat main event for the WWE Championship, allowing CM Punk to pin John Cena and retain the title.[65] The trio declared themselves The Shield, vowed to rally against \"injustice\" and denied working for Punk,[66][67] but they routinely emerged from the crowd to attack Punk's adversaries.[68][69] This led to a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match being set up for the TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs pay-per-view event, where Ambrose, Rollins and Reigns defeated Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane) and Ryback in their WWE debut match.[70] The Shield continued to aid Punk after TLC, attacking both Ryback and The Rock in January 2013.[71][72] It was revealed on the January 28 episode of Raw that Punk and his manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield and Brad Maddox to work for them all along.[73]\nThe Shield then quietly ended their association with Punk while beginning a feud with John Cena, Ryback and Sheamus that led to a six-man tag match on February 17 at Elimination Chamber, which The Shield won.[74][75][76] The Shield then faced Sheamus, Big Show and Randy Orton at WrestleMania 29, where The Shield emerged victorious in their first WrestleMania match.[77][78] The following night on Raw, The Shield attempted to attack The Undertaker, but were stopped by Team Hell No.[79] This set up a six-man tag team match on the April 22 episode of Raw, which The Shield won.[80] On the May 13 episode of Raw, The Shield's undefeated streak in televised six-man tag team matches ended in a disqualification loss in a six-man elimination tag team match against John Cena, Kane and Daniel Bryan.[81]\nOn May 19 at Extreme Rules, Rollins and Reigns defeated Team Hell No in a tornado tag team match to win the WWE Tag Team Championship.[82] On the June 14 episode of SmackDown, The Shield suffered their first decisive loss in televised six-man tag team matches against Team Hell No and Randy Orton when Bryan made Rollins submit.[83][84] Rollins and Reigns then successfully retained the WWE Tag Team Championship against Bryan and Orton at Payback on June 13.[85] In August, The Shield began working for Chief operating officer Triple H and The Authority.[86][87] Rollins and Reigns also successfully defended their titles against The Usos during the Money in the Bank pre-show and against The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil) at Night of Champions.[88][89]\nAt Battleground in October, the recently (kayfabe) fired Cody Rhodes and Goldust reclaimed their jobs back by beating Rollins and Reigns in a non-title match.[90] On the October 14 episode of Raw, Rollins and Reigns lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a No Disqualification match following interference from Big Show.[91] At Hell in a Cell on October 27, Rollins and Reigns failed to regain the titles in a triple threat match also involving The Usos.[92] The following month at Survivor Series, The Shield teamed with Antonio Cesaro and Jack Swagger to take on Rey Mysterio, The Usos, Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a traditional Survivor Series match.

Later that night, Rollins and Ambrose defeated Ziggler and McIntyre to win the Raw Tag Team Championship (making Rollins a double champion), only for Ambrose to turn on Rollins as he attacked him, igniting a feud between the two and disbanding The Shield once again.[220] Rollins and Ambrose's reign as Raw Tag Team Champions was ended on the November 5 episode of Raw, when Rollins lost a handicap match to AOP (Akam and Rezar).[221] Two weeks later, on November 18, at Survivor Series, Rollins defeated United States Champion Shinsuke Nakamura in an interbrand champion vs. champion match.[222] Towards the end of the year, Rollins continued feuding with Ambrose,[223][224][225][226] which led to a title match on December 16 at the TLC, where Ambrose defeated Rollins and ended his reign at 119 days.[227][228] Going into 2019, Rollins failed to regain the championship from Ambrose on several occasions, including in a Falls Count Anywhere match when Bobby Lashley interfered,[229] and in a triple threat match in which Lashley won the championship after pinning Ambrose.[230]\nOn January 27 at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Rollins won his first Royal Rumble match by lastly eliminating Braun Strowman.[231] The following night on Raw, Rollins challenged Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 35.[232] Soon after, Rollins reconciled with Ambrose and the recently returned Reigns to reform The Shield for the third time.[233][234] The trio defeated the team of Drew McIntyre, Bobby Lashley and Baron Corbin at Fastlane.[235] At WrestleMania 35 in April, Rollins defeated Lesnar to win the Universal Championship for the first time.[236]\nRollins then entered a feud with AJ Styles,[237][238] facing him in a match for the Universal Championship at Money in the Bank in May, in which Rollins retained.[239] Rollins successfully defended the title against Corbin at Super ShowDown and Stomping Grounds in June; the latter title defense featured Lacey Evans as special guest referee. He won with assistance of his real life girlfriend and Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch to overcome Evans' biased refereeing.[240][241] Rollins teamed up with Lynch and defeated Corbin and Evans at Extreme Rules in a Winner Takes All Extreme Rules match mixed tag team match.[242] Afterwards, Rollins lost the title to Lesnar, who cashed in his Money in the Bank contract, ending his reign at 98 days.[243] The following night on Raw, Rollins won a ten-man battle royal for the right to face Lesnar for the championship at SummerSlam by last eliminating Randy Orton.[244] At the event, Rollins defeated Lesnar to regain the championship, making him the only other wrestler besides Lesnar to hold the Universal Championship more than once. He also became the only superstar to defeat Lesnar at both WrestleMania and SummerSlam.[245]\nOn the August 19 episode of Raw, Rollins won his record-tying fifth Raw Tag Team Championship along with Braun Strowman when they defeated Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows.[246] At Clash of Champions, Rollins and Strowman lost the titles to the team of Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode. Later that night, Rollins successfully defended the Universal Championship against Strowman in the main event, but was attacked by \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt after the match.[247] At Hell in a Cell, Rollins defended his title against The Fiend in a Hell in a Cell match that ended in referee stoppage after The Fiend was buried under several weapons and hit with a sledgehammer by Rollins.[248] After that, Rollins was then made captain for Team Hogan at Crown Jewel. However, he was removed when he was then scheduled in a rematch against Wyatt for the Universal Championship in a Falls count anywhere match.[249] At the event, Rollins lost the title to The Fiend.[250]\nIn November, Rollins was selected as the captain for Team Raw at Survivor Series, against Team SmackDown and Team NXT.[251] At the event, Team SmackDown was victorious in the main event match.[252] The following night on Raw, Rollins berated the entire Raw roster for \"dropping the ball\" and failing to win at the pay-per-view. These comments later drew the attention of Kevin Owens, who attacked Rollins and challenged him to a match, which ended in a disqualification after AOP (Akam and Rezar) attacked Owens.[253][254] On the December 9 episode of Raw, despite earlier denying an alliance with AOP, Rollins joined the group in attacking Owens, turning heel for the first time since 2016.[255]\nBy the beginning of 2020, Rollins began proclaiming himself as the \"Monday Night Messiah\".[256] Throughout the next several weeks, Rollins and AOP would attack and brutalize the likes of Rey Mysterio, Samoa Joe, and Kevin Owens, with the latter receiving the worst of it until Joe and a returning Big Show came to Owens' aid.[256][257] On the January 13, 2020 episode of Raw, Rollins and AOP were assisted by Buddy Murphy in their match against Big Show, Owens and Joe, thereby adding Murphy to their faction.[258] The following week on Raw, Rollins and Murphy defeated The Viking Raiders to win the Raw Tag Team Championship, becoming a record six-time reign for Rollins individually.[259]\nPart of his WWE ring name is a tribute to former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins.[260] During his time in FCW, Rollins used a superkick to a kneeling opponent called Avada Kedavra as a finisher.[261][262] When he joined The Authority, he adopted Triple H's Pedigree as his finishing maneuver.[263] In April 2017, he introduced a new finishing move, a jumping knee strike called the Ripcord Knee.[264] Rollins has known to use his current and most notable finisher, the Curb Stomp (often referred to as simply the Stomp),[265] for most of his career.[266] However, Rollins didn't use his Stomp after his title win at WrestleMania because Vince McMahon thought it was a \"cruel\" move for their WWE Champion.[267]\nThroughout his time as a member of The Shield, before the team initially dispersed, his character was that of an \"out-spoken hot-head who will do crazy things\" to help The Shield.[268] After turning into a villain and aligning himself with AOP in late-2019, Rollins began to dub himself  \"Monday Night Messiah\" and allude himself to Jesus.[256][269]\nIn 2019, Rollins received attention for his social media activities and public comments.[270][271] In June, Rollins received criticism for his interaction with fellow wrestler Will Ospreay on Twitter, who Rollins referenced as \"little guy\" and urged to \"compare bank accounts\" with him; he apologized in early July, calling the tweets \"garbage\" and \"not in line with my values\".[272][273][274] He later publicly called Jon Moxley (who had performed on WWE as Dean Ambrose) \"presumptuous\" for criticizing WWE following his departure from the company, as well as regarding professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (where Moxley went to compete after his departure from WWE) as the \"minor leagues\".[275][276] In November, Rollins publicly refuted a story published by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter that claimed that he spoke during a backstage meeting prior to an episode of Raw.[277] The Wrestling Observer Newsletter later issued a retraction and an apology to Rollins.[278]\nIn the same year, Rollins' character notably drew criticisms from audiences, particularly after he retained the Universal Championship over \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt via referee stoppage at the Hell in a Cell event, to which the live crowd reacted negatively.[279][280][281][282][283] Bleacher Report subsequently stated that the negative reaction was a response against \"a character that has become too bland, one-dimensional and unlikable for fans to continue supporting.\"[284] Following Rollins' heel-turn shortly after his feud with Wyatt, the New York Post hypothesized that \"WWE had no choice but to turn Seth Rollins heel\", even though it \"doesn\u2019t absolve WWE from blame for needing to make the switch\".[285] Meanwhile, Forbes noted that after his heel-turn, \"for the first time in a long time, reaction to the direction of Rollins' character has been overwhelmingly positive\".[286]\nRollins is regularly featured on Xavier Woods' YouTube channel UpUpDownDown, where he goes by the nickname 'The Champ'. In August 2019, Rollins won a #1 contender's tournament to challenge Samoa Joe for the UpUpDownDown Championship. He defeated Joe in a game of Track &amp; Field II to win the championship.[287] In October, in his first and only defense, Rollins lost the championship to Becky Lynch in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite.[288]\nLopez resides in Moline, Illinois.[289] He is an atheist[290][291] and a fan of the Chicago Bears and St. Louis Cardinals.[4]\nIn 2014, Lopez and his former tag team partner Marek Brave started The Black &amp; The Brave Wrestling Academy, a professional wrestling school in Moline.[292] In February 2019, Lopez opened a coffee shop called 329 Dport in his hometown of Davenport, Iowa.[293]\nOn February 9, 2015, a nude photo of former NXT wrestler Zahra Schreiber, reportedly Lopez's girlfriend,[294] was posted to his social media accounts, the contents of which are automatically republished by WWE.com.[295] Soon after, nude photos of Lopez were posted on the Twitter page of his then-fianc\u00e9e,[296] Leighla Schultz.[297] In response, Lopez apologized for \"private photographs that were distributed without [his] consent\".[298][299] On February 25, 2016, Lopez revealed that he had broken up with Schreiber, but did not say what caused the split.[300]\nAfter months of speculation, it was confirmed on May 13, 2019, that Lopez was in a relationship with fellow WWE wrestler Rebecca Quin, better known as Becky Lynch.[301][302] WWE subsequently acknowledged the relationship on their website.[303] The couple announced their engagement on August 22, 2019.[304][305]\nOn September 10, 2019, Lopez found out that he had a brother and a sister after taking a DNA test.[306]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRichard Bruce Cheney (/\u02c8t\u0283e\u026ani/;[1] born January 30, 1941) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 46th vice president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He has been cited as the most powerful vice president in American history.[2][3] He is also one of the most unpopular politicians in the history of the US, holding an approval rating of just 13% at the time of leaving office.[4] Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and grew up in Casper, Wyoming.[5] He attended Yale and then the University of Wyoming, at the latter of which he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science. He began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger, eventually working his way into the White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations. He served as White House chief of staff from 1975 to 1977. In 1978, Cheney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He represented Wyoming's at-large congressional district from 1979 to 1989, briefly serving as House minority whip in 1989. Cheney was selected to be the secretary of defense during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, holding the position for the majority of Bush's term from 1989 to 1993.[6] During his time in the Department of Defense, Cheney oversaw the 1991 Operation Desert Storm, among other actions. Out of office during the Clinton administration, Cheney was the Chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000. In July 2000, Cheney was chosen by presumptive Republican Presidential nominee George W. Bush as his running mate in the 2000 Presidential election. They defeated their Democratic opponents, incumbent Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman. In 2004 Cheney was reelected to his second term as Vice President with Bush as President, defeating their Democratic opponents Senators John Kerry and John Edwards. During Cheney's tenure as Vice President, he played a leading behind-the-scenes role in the George W. Bush administration's response to the September 11 attacks and coordination of the Global War on Terrorism. He was an early proponent of invading Iraq and defender of the Administration's anti-terrorism record. He became at odds with President Bush's position against same-sex marriage in 2004.[7] Cheney was often criticized for the Bush Administration's policies regarding the campaign against terrorism, wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) and torture.[8][9][10] Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (n\u00e9e Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney. He is of predominantly English, as well as Welsh, Irish, and French Huguenot ancestry; Cheney's 8th great-grandfather, William Cheney, immigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 17th century.[11][12][13] Cheney is a very distant cousin of both Harry S. Truman and Barack Obama; the three share a common ancestor in Mareen Duvall, a Huguenot who fled from France to England in the 17th century and later settled in Maryland.[14] His father was a soil conservation agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and his mother was a softball star in the 1930s;[15] Cheney was one of three children. He attended Calvert Elementary School[16][17] before his family moved to Casper, Wyoming,[18] where he attended Natrona County High School. He attended Yale University, but by his own account had problems adjusting to the college, and dropped out.[19][20] Among the influential teachers from his days in New Haven was Professor H. Bradford Westerfield, whom Cheney repeatedly credited with having helped to shape his approach to foreign policy.[21] He later attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science. He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.[22] In November 1962, at the age of 21, Cheney was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was arrested for DWI again the following year.[23] Cheney said that the arrests made him \"think about where I was and where I was headed. I was headed down a bad road if I continued on that course.\"[24] In 1964, he married Lynne Vincent, his high school sweetheart, whom he had met at age 14. When Cheney became eligible for the draft, during the Vietnam War, he applied for and received five draft deferments. In 1989, The Washington Post writer George C. Wilson interviewed Cheney as the next Secretary of Defense; when asked about his deferments, Cheney reportedly said, \"I had other priorities in the '60s than military service.\"[25] Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub-par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Upon graduation, Cheney was eligible for the draft, but at the time, the Selective Service System was not inducting married men.[26] On October 6, 1965, the draft was expanded to include married men without children; Cheney's first daughter, Elizabeth, was born 9 months and two days later.[27][26] Cheney's fifth and final deferment granted him \"3-A\" status, a \"hardship\" deferment available to men with dependents. In January 1967, Cheney turned 26 and was no longer eligible for the draft.[27] In 1966 Cheney dropped out of the doctoral program at the University of Wisconsin to work as staff aide for Gov. Warren Knowles.[28] In 1968 Cheney was awarded an American Political Science Association congressional fellowship and moved to Washington.[28] Cheney's political career began in 1969, as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969 to 1970.[23] He held several positions in the years that followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971 to 1973, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974 to 1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.[29][30] Cheney was Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Chief of Staff under Gerald Ford.[31] When Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense, Cheney became White House Chief of Staff, succeeding Rumsfeld.[23] He later was campaign manager for Ford's 1976 presidential campaign.[32] In 1978, Cheney was elected to represent Wyoming in the U.S. House of Representatives and succeeded retiring Democratic Congressman Teno Roncalio, having defeated his Democratic opponent, Bill Bagley. Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989. In 1987, he was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference. The following year, he was elected House Minority Whip.[33] He served for two and a half months before he was appointed Secretary of Defense instead of former U.S. Senator John G. Tower, whose nomination had been rejected by the U.S. Senate in March 1989.[34] He voted against the creation of the U.S. Department of Education, citing his concern over budget deficits and expansion of the federal government, and claiming that the Department was an encroachment on states' rights.[35] He voted against funding Head Start, but reversed his position in 2000.[36] Cheney initially voted in 1978 against establishing a national holiday in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., but supported creation of the holiday five years later in 1983.[37] Cheney supported Bob Michel's (R-IL) bid to become Republican Minority Leader.[38] In April 1980, Cheney endorsed Governor Ronald Reagan for President, becoming one of Reagan's earliest supporters.[39] After the resignation of James G. Watt as Interior Secretary in 1983, Cheney was a top candidate to succeed him, but Reagan appointed William Clark instead. In 1986, after President Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to impose economic sanctions on South Africa for its policy of apartheid, Cheney was one of 83 Representatives to vote against overriding Reagan's veto.[40] In later years, he articulated his opposition to unilateral sanctions against many different countries, stating \"they almost never work\"[41] and that in that case they might have ended up hurting the people instead.[42] In 1986, Cheney, along with 145 Republicans and 31 Democrats, voted against a non-binding Congressional resolution calling on the South African government to release Nelson Mandela from prison, after the Democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required Mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the African National Congress (ANC) and requiring it to oust the communist faction from its leadership; the resolution was defeated. Appearing on CNN, Cheney addressed criticism for this, saying he opposed the resolution because the ANC \"at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and had a number of interests that were fundamentally inimical to the United States.\"[43] The federal building in Casper, a regional center of the fossil fuel industry, is named the Dick Cheney Federal Building.[44][45] Originally declining, U.S. Congressman Barber Conable persuaded Cheney to join the moderate Republican Wednesday Group in order to move up the leadership ranks. He was elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987. Cheney was the Ranking Member of the Select Committee to investigate the Iran-Contra Affair.[23][46][47] He promoted Wyoming's petroleum and coal businesses as well.[48] President George H. W. Bush nominated Cheney for the office of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S. Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position.[49] The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0[49] and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993. He directed the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. In 1991, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush.[33][50] Later that year, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[51] Cheney has said his time at the Pentagon was the most rewarding period of his public service career, calling it \"the one that stands out.\" In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. \"My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war,\" Cheney said, \"and it occurred to me as I was in the room as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military.\"[52] Cheney worked closely with Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the beginning of his tenure. He focused primarily on external matters, and left most of the internal DoD management to Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood.[34] Cheney's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup at the height of the Cold War.[53] As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics.[34] Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.[54] When the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the House Armed Services Committee's recommendation.[34] In subsequent years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.[34] Over his four years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993.[34] Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed the development of a Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.[55] Cheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.[34] Cheney's views on NATO reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin.[34] Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.[56] Cheney persuaded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war planes in the nation. This was an important element of the success of the Gulf War, as well as a lightning-rod for Islamists, such as Osama bin Laden, who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.[57] Using economic sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor.[34] In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties.[58] Although the mission was controversial,[59] U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.[60] In 1991, the Somali Civil War drew the world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide humanitarian assistance, primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched the first of 26,000 U.S. troops to Somalia as part of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), designed to provide security and food relief.[34] Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin and William J. Perry, had to contend with both the Bosnian and Somali issues. On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent the invading Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation.[61] An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border.[34] The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves. Cheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale U.S. military operation. According to General Colin Powell, Cheney \"had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy. He spent hours in the National Military Command Center peppering my staff with questions.\"[34] Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested U.S. military assistance. The United Nations took action as well, passing a series of resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the UN Security Council authorized \"all means necessary\" to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by January 15, 1991.[61] By then, the United States had a force of about 500,000 stationed in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Other nations, including Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Syria, and Egypt, contributed troops, and other allies, most notably Germany and Japan, agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort, named Operation Desert Shield.[34] On January 12, 1991, Congress authorized Bush to use military force to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions on Kuwait.[61] The first phase of Operation Desert Storm, which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraqi forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including the cities of Baghdad and Basra. Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war.[34] He flew with Powell to the region to review and finalize the ground war plans.[61] After an air offensive of more than five weeks, UN Coalition forces launched the ground war on February 24. Within 100 hours, Iraqi forces had been routed from Kuwait and Schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective\u2014expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait\u2014had been met on February 27.[62] After consultation with Cheney and other members of his national security team, Bush declared a suspension of hostilities.[61] On working with this national security team, Cheney has said, \"there have been five Republican presidents since Eisenhower. I worked for four of them and worked closely with a fifth\u2014the Reagan years when I was part of the House leadership. The best national security team I ever saw was that one. The least friction, the most cooperation, the highest degree of trust among the principals, especially.\"[63] A total of 147 U.S. military personnel died in combat, and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes.[34][62] Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6.[34] There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces.[34] Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon.[64][65] In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad. Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a \"bad idea\" and would have led to a \"quagmire\", explaining that: Because if we'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it\u2014eastern Iraq\u2014the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families\u2014it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.[66][67] Cheney regarded the Gulf War as an example of the kind of regional problem the United States was likely to continue to face in the future.[68] We're always going to have to be involved [in the Middle East]. Maybe it's part of our national character, you know we like to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up, put a ribbon around it. You deploy a force, you win the war and the problem goes away. But it doesn't work that way in the Middle East. It never has, and isn't likely to in my lifetime. Between 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney was a director of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization.[69] With the new Democratic administration under President Bill Clinton in January 1993, Cheney left the Department of Defense and joined the American Enterprise Institute. He also served a second term as a Council on Foreign Relations director from 1993 to 1995.[69] From 1995 until 2000, he served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton, a Fortune 500 company. Cheney's record as CEO was subject to some dispute among Wall Street analysts. A 1998 merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries attracted the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency.[70] Although Cheney is not named as an individual defendant in the suit, Halliburton shareholders are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated its stock price during this period. In June 2011, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case to continue in litigation.[71] Cheney was named in a December 2010 corruption complaint filed by the Nigerian government against Halliburton, which the company settled for $250 million.[72] During Cheney's term, Halliburton changed its accounting practices regarding revenue realization of disputed costs on major construction projects.[73] Cheney resigned as CEO of Halliburton on July 25, 2000. As vice president, he argued that this step, along with establishing a trust and other actions, removed any conflict of interest.[74] Cheney's net worth, estimated to be between $19 million and $86 million,[75] is largely derived from his post at Halliburton.[76] His 2006 gross joint income with his wife was nearly $8.82 million.[77] He was also a member of the board of advisors of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) before becoming vice president.[57] In early 2000, while serving as the CEO of Halliburton, Cheney headed then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush's vice-presidential search committee. On July 25, after reviewing Cheney's findings, Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket.[23][78] Halliburton reportedly reached agreement on July 20 to allow Cheney to retire, with a package estimated at $20 million.[79] A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for \"an inhabitant of the same state with themselves\"[80] for both President and Vice President. Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential election. While the election was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet.[81] According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[82] Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons. For a period, Cheney stayed at a variety of undisclosed locations, out of public view.[83] Cheney later revealed in his memoir In My Time that these \"undisclosed locations\" included his official Vice Presidential residence, his home in Wyoming, and Camp David.[84] He also utilized a heavy security detail, employing a motorcade of 12 to 18 government vehicles for his daily commute from the Vice Presidential residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory to the White House.[85] On the morning of June 29, 2002, Cheney served as acting president from 11:09 am to 1:24 pm, under the terms of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, while Bush was undergoing a colonoscopy.[86][87] Following 9/11, Cheney was instrumental in providing a primary justification for a renewed war against Iraq. Cheney helped shape Bush's approach to the \"War on Terror\", making numerous public statements alleging Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction,[88] and making several personal visits to CIA headquarters, where he questioned mid-level agency analysts on their conclusions.[89] Cheney continued to allege links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, even though President Bush received a classified President's Daily Brief on September 21, 2001, indicating the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that \"there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda.\"[90] Furthermore, in 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded that there was no \"collaborative relationship\" between Iraq and al-Qaeda.[91] By 2014, Cheney continued to misleadingly claim that Saddam \"had a 10-year relationship with al Qaeda.\"[92] Following the US invasion of Iraq, Cheney remained steadfast in his support of the war, stating that it would be an \"enormous success story\",[93] and made many visits to the country. He often criticized war critics, calling them \"opportunists\" who were peddling \"cynical and pernicious falsehoods\" to gain political advantage while US soldiers died in Iraq. In response, Senator John Kerry asserted, \"It is hard to name a government official with less credibility on Iraq [than Cheney].\"[94] In a March 24, 2008, extended interview conducted in Ankara, Turkey, with ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz on the fifth anniversary of the original U.S. military assault on Iraq, Cheney responded to a question about public opinion polls showing that Americans had lost confidence in the war by simply replying \"So?\"[95] This remark prompted widespread criticism, including from former Oklahoma Republican Congressman Mickey Edwards, a long-time personal friend of Cheney.[96] Bush and Cheney were re-elected in the 2004 presidential election, running against John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards. During the election, the pregnancy of his daughter Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney in light of the same-sex marriage debate.[97] Cheney has stated that he is in favor of gay marriages personally, but that each individual U.S. state should decide whether to permit it or not.[98] Cheney's former chief legal counsel, David Addington,[99] became his chief of staff and remained in that office until Cheney's departure from office. John P. Hannah served as Cheney's national security adviser.[100] Until his indictment and resignation[101] in 2005, I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Jr. served in both roles.[102] On the morning of July 21, 2007, Cheney once again served as acting president, from 7:16\u00a0am to 9:21\u00a0am. Bush transferred the power of the presidency prior to undergoing a medical procedure, requiring sedation, and later resumed his powers and duties that same day.[103] After his term began in 2001, Cheney was occasionally asked if he was interested in the Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term and he did not run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator John McCain.[104] Cheney was a prominent member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG),[105] commonly known as the Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.[106] Beginning in 2003, Cheney's staff opted not to file required reports with the National Archives and Records Administration office charged with assuring that the executive branch protects classified information, nor did it allow inspection of its record keeping.[107] Cheney refused to release the documents, citing his executive privilege to deny congressional information requests.[108][109] Media outlets such as Time magazine and CBS News questioned whether Cheney had created a \"fourth branch of government\" that was not subject to any laws.[110] A group of historians and open-government advocates filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, asking the court to declare that Cheney's vice-presidential records are covered by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and cannot be destroyed, taken or withheld from the public without proper review.[111][112][113][114] On October 18, 2005, The Washington Post reported that the vice president's office was central to the investigation of the Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal, for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was one of the figures under investigation.[115] Following an indictment, Libby resigned his positions as Cheney's chief of staff and assistant on national security affairs. On September 8, 2006, Richard Armitage, former Deputy Secretary of State, publicly announced that he was the source of the revelation of Plame's status. Armitage said he was not a part of a conspiracy to reveal Plame's identity and did not know whether one existed.[116] In February 2006, The National Journal reported that Libby had stated before a grand jury that his superiors, including Cheney, had authorized him to disclose classified information to the press regarding intelligence on Iraq's weapons.[117] On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted on four felony counts for obstruction of justice, perjury, and making false statements to federal investigators.[118] In his closing arguments, independent prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said that there was \"a cloud over the vice president\",[119] an apparent reference to Cheney's interview with FBI agents investigating the case, which was made public in 2009.[120] Cheney lobbied President George W. Bush vigorously and unsuccessfully to grant Libby a full presidential pardon up to the day of Barack Obama's inauguration, likening Libby to a \"soldier on the battlefield\".[121][122] On February 27, 2007, at about 10\u00a0am, a suicide bomber killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target. They also claimed that Osama Bin Laden supervised the operation.[123] The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away. He reported hearing the blast, saying \"I heard a loud boom... The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate.\"[124] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban.[125] Cheney has been characterized as the most powerful and influential Vice President in history.[126][127] Both supporters and critics of Cheney regard him as a shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney[128] in addition to his office in the West Wing,[129] his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building,[130] and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).[128][131] Cheney has actively promoted an expansion of the powers of the presidency, saying that the Bush administration's challenges to the laws which Congress passed after Vietnam and Watergate to contain and oversee the executive branch\u2014the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Presidential Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the War Powers Resolution\u2014are, in Cheney's words, \"a restoration, if you will, of the power and authority of the president\".[132][133] In June 2007, The Washington Post summarized Cheney's vice presidency in a Pulitzer Prize-winning[134] four-part series, based in part on interviews with former administration officials. The articles characterized Cheney not as a \"shadow\" president, but as someone who usually has the last words of counsel to the president on policies, which in many cases would reshape the powers of the presidency. When former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested to Cheney that the office was largely ceremonial, Cheney reportedly replied, \"I have a different understanding with the president.\" The articles described Cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government, indicated by the use of his own security classification and three man-sized safes in his offices.[135] The articles described Cheney's influence on decisions pertaining to detention of suspected terrorists and the legal limits that apply to their questioning, especially what constitutes torture.[136] U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Colin Powell's chief of staff when he was both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the same time Cheney was Secretary of Defense, and then later when Powell was Secretary of State, stated in an in-depth interview that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld established an alternative program to interrogate post-9/11 detainees because of their mutual distrust of CIA.[137] The Washington Post articles, principally written by Barton Gellman, further characterized Cheney as having the strongest influence within the administration in shaping budget and tax policy in a manner that assures \"conservative orthodoxy.\"[138] They also highlighted Cheney's behind-the-scenes influence on the Bush administration's environmental policy to ease pollution controls for power plants, facilitate the disposal of nuclear waste, open access to federal timber resources, and avoid federal constraints on greenhouse gas emissions, among other issues. The articles characterized his approach to policy formulation as favoring business over the environment.[139] In June 2008, Cheney allegedly attempted to block efforts by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to strike a controversial US compromise deal with North Korea over the communist state's nuclear program.[140] In July 2008, a former Environmental Protection Agency official stated publicly that Cheney's office had pushed significantly for large-scale deletions from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on the health effects of global warming \"fearing the presentation by a leading health official might make it harder to avoid regulating greenhouse gases.\"[141] In October, when the report appeared with six pages cut from the testimony, The White House stated that the changes were made due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the science. However, according to the former senior adviser on climate change to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson, Cheney's office was directly responsible for nearly half of the original testimony being deleted.[141] In his role as President of the U.S. Senate, Cheney broke with the Bush Administration Department of Justice, and signed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in the case of Heller v. District of Columbia that successfully challenged gun laws in the nation's capital on Second Amendment grounds.[142] On February 14, 2010, in an appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his support of waterboarding and for the torture of captured terrorist suspects, saying, \"I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program.\"[143] The Washington Post reported in 2008 that Cheney purchased a home in McLean, Virginia, part of the Washington suburbs, which he was to tear down for a replacement structure. He also maintains homes in Wyoming and on Maryland's Eastern Shore.[144] In July 2012, Cheney used his Wyoming home to host a private fund-raiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, which netted over $4 million in contributions from attendees for Romney's campaign.[145] Cheney is the subject of the documentary film The World According to Dick Cheney, premiering March 15, 2013, on the Showtime television channel.[146][147][148] Cheney was also reported to be the subject of an HBO television mini-series based on Barton Gellman's 2008 book Angler[149] and the 2006 documentary The Dark Side, produced by the Public Broadcasting Service.[150] Cheney maintained a visible public profile after leaving office,[151] being especially critical of Obama administration policies on national security.[152][153][154] In May 2009, Cheney spoke of his support for same-sex marriage, becoming one of the most prominent Republican politicians to do so. Speaking to the National Press Club, Cheney stated: \"People ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish. I do believe, historically, the way marriage has been regulated is at a state level. It's always been a state issue, and I think that's the way it ought to be handled today.\"[155] In 2012, Cheney reportedly encouraged several Maryland state legislators to vote to legalize same-sex marriage in that state.[156] Although, by custom, a former vice president unofficially receives six months of protection from the United States Secret Service, President Obama reportedly extended the protection period for Cheney.[157] On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta told the Senate and House intelligence committees that the CIA withheld information about a secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year.[158] The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.[159] Cheney has said that the Tea Party Movement is a \"positive influence on the Republican Party\" and that \" I think it's much better to have that kind of turmoil and change in the Republican Party than it would be to have it outside.\"[160] Cheney said that Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections could be considered \"an act of war\".[161] Following the swearing-in of his daughter Liz in his former congressional seat in January 2017, Cheney said he believed she would do well in the position and that he would only offer advice if requested.[162] Cheney has publicly criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election. On December 29, 2009, four days after the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from the Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized Obama: \"[We] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe. ... Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency\u2014social transformation\u2014the restructuring of American society.\"[163] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, \"[I]t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer.\"[164][165] During a February 14, 2010 appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration's policies for handling suspected terrorists, criticizing the \"mindset\" of treating \"terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts as opposed to acts of war\".[143] In a May 2, 2011, interview with ABC News, Cheney praised the Obama administration for the covert military operation in Pakistan that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.[166] In 2014, during an interview with Sean Hannity, he called Barack Obama a \"weak President\" after Obama announced his plans to pull forces out of Afghanistan.[167] In August 2011, Cheney published his memoir, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir, written with Liz Cheney. The book outlines Cheney's recollections of 9/11, the War on Terrorism, the 2001 War in Afghanistan, the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" and other events.[168] According to Barton Gellman, the author of Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, Cheney's book differs from publicly available records on details surrounding the NSA surveillance program.[169][170] In 2015, Cheney published another book, Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, again co-authored with his daughter Liz. The book traces the history of U.S. foreign policy and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt's administration through the Obama administration. The authors tell the story of what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II.[171] Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer what they see as the solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom.[172][173] Cheney's early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable, reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the September 11 attacks at 68 percent.[174] However, polling numbers for both him and the president gradually declined in their second terms,[174][175] with Cheney reaching his lowest point shortly before leaving office at 13 percent.[175][176] Cheney's Gallup poll figures are mostly consistent with those from other polls:[174][177] In April 2007, Cheney was awarded an honorary doctorate of public service by Brigham Young University, where he delivered the commencement address.[178] His selection as commencement speaker was controversial. The college board of trustees issued a statement explaining that the invitation should be viewed \"as one extended to someone holding the high office of vice president of the United States rather than to a partisan political figure\".[179] BYU permitted a protest to occur so long as it did not \"make personal attacks against Cheney, attack (the) BYU administration, the church or the First Presidency\".[180] Cheney has been cited as the most powerful vice president in American history.[2][3] Cheney has been compared to Darth Vader, a characterization originated by his critics, but which was later adopted humorously by Cheney himself as well as by members of his family and staff.[181] As a result of Cheney having admitted that he \"signed off\" on the so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" program,[182][183] some public officials, as well as several media outlets and advocacy groups, have called for his prosecution under various anti-torture and war crimes statutes.[184][185] In Jon Meacham's book Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush, published in November 2015, the 41st president, although also laudatory of Cheney, is in part critical of the former vice president, whom Bush describes as \"having his own empire\" and \"very hard-line.\"[186] Cheney is a member of the United Methodist Church[191] and was the first Methodist vice president to serve under a Methodist president.[192] His wife, Lynne, was chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to 1996. She is now a public speaker, author, and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The couple have two children, Elizabeth \"Liz\" and Mary Cheney, and seven grandchildren. Liz, congresswoman from Wyoming since 2017, is married to Philip J. Perry, a former General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security. Mary, a former employee of the Colorado Rockies baseball team and the Coors Brewing Company, was a campaign aide to the Bush re-election campaign; she lives in Great Falls, Virginia, with her wife Heather Poe.[193] Cheney has publicly supported gay marriage since leaving the vice presidency.[194] Cheney has a pet dog named Nelson.[195][196][197] Cheney's long histories of cardiovascular disease and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office.[198] Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years,[199] Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle.[200][201] He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.[200] On September 24, 2005, Cheney underwent a six-hour endo-vascular procedure to repair popliteal artery aneurysms bilaterally, a catheter treatment technique used in the artery behind each knee.[202] The condition was discovered at a regular physical in July, and was not life-threatening.[203] Cheney was hospitalized for tests after experiencing shortness of breath five months later. In late April 2006, an ultrasound revealed that the clot was smaller.[202] On March 5, 2007, Cheney was treated for deep-vein thrombosis in his left leg at George Washington University Hospital after experiencing pain in his left calf. Doctors prescribed blood-thinning medication and allowed him to return to work.[204] CBS News reported that during the morning of November 26, 2007, Cheney was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and underwent treatment that afternoon.[202] On July 12, 2008, Cheney underwent a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old man with a history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia.[205] On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.[206] On January 19, 2009, Cheney strained his back \"while moving boxes into his new house\". As a consequence, he was in a wheelchair for two days, including his attendance at the 2009 United States presidential inauguration.[207][208] On February 22, 2010, Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after experiencing chest pains. A spokesperson later said Cheney had experienced a mild heart attack after doctors had run tests.[201] On June 25, 2010, Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after reporting discomfort.[209] In early July 2010, Cheney was outfitted with a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) at Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute to compensate for worsening congestive heart failure.[210] The device pumped blood continuously through his body.[211][212] He was released from Inova on August 9, 2010,[213] and had to decide whether to seek a full heart transplant.[214][215] This pump was centrifugal and as a result he remained alive without a pulse for nearly fifteen months.[216] On March 24, 2012, Cheney underwent a seven-hour heart transplant procedure at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Woodburn, Virginia, at the age of 71. He had been on a waiting list for more than 20 months before receiving the heart from an anonymous donor.[217][218] Cheney's principal cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, advised his patient that \"it would not be unreasonable for an otherwise healthy 71-year-old man to expect to live another 10 years\" with a transplant, saying in a family-authorized interview that he considered Cheney to be otherwise healthy.[219] On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney accidentally shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while participating in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas.[220] Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart.[221] Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them. The Secret Service stated that they notified the Sheriff about one hour after the shooting. Kenedy County Sheriff Ramone Salinas III stated that he first heard of the shooting at about 5:30 pm.[222] The next day, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong informed the Corpus Christi Caller-Times of the shooting.[223] Cheney had a televised interview with MSNBC News about the shooting on February 15. Both Cheney and Whittington have called the incident an accident. Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor. Whittington has since told The Washington Post that he and Cheney were not close friends but acquaintances. When asked if Cheney had apologized, Whittington declined to answer.[224] The sheriff's office released a report on the shooting on February 16, 2006, and witness statements on February 22, indicating that the shooting occurred on a clear sunny day, and Whittington was shot from 30 or 40 yards (40\u00a0m) away while searching for a downed bird. Armstrong, the ranch owner, claimed that all in the hunting party were wearing blaze-orange safety gear and none had been drinking.[225] However, Cheney has acknowledged that he had one beer four or five hours prior to the shooting.[226] Although Kenedy County Sheriff's Office documents support the official story by Cheney and his party, re-creations of the incident produced by George Gongora and John Metz of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times indicated that the actual shooting distance was closer than the 30 yards claimed.[227] The incident hurt Cheney's popularity standing in the polls.[228] According to polls on February 27, 2006, two weeks after the accident, Dick Cheney's approval rating had dropped 5 percentage points to 18%.[229] The incident became the subject of a number of jokes and satire.[230]",

He has been cited as the most powerful vice president in American history.[2][3] He is also one of the most unpopular politicians in the history of the US, holding an approval rating of just 13% at the time of leaving office.[4]\nCheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and grew up in Casper, Wyoming.[5] He attended Yale and then the University of Wyoming, at the latter of which he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science. He began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger, eventually working his way into the White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations. He served as White House chief of staff from 1975 to 1977. In 1978, Cheney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He represented Wyoming's at-large congressional district from 1979 to 1989, briefly serving as House minority whip in 1989. Cheney was selected to be the secretary of defense during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, holding the position for the majority of Bush's term from 1989 to 1993.[6] During his time in the Department of Defense, Cheney oversaw the 1991 Operation Desert Storm, among other actions. Out of office during the Clinton administration, Cheney was the Chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000.\nIn July 2000, Cheney was chosen by presumptive Republican Presidential nominee George W. Bush as his running mate in the 2000 Presidential election. They defeated their Democratic opponents, incumbent Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman. In 2004 Cheney was reelected to his second term as Vice President with Bush as President, defeating their Democratic opponents Senators John Kerry and John Edwards. During Cheney's tenure as Vice President, he played a leading behind-the-scenes role in the George W. Bush administration's response to the September 11 attacks and coordination of the Global War on Terrorism. He was an early proponent of invading Iraq and defender of the Administration's anti-terrorism record. He became at odds with President Bush's position against same-sex marriage in 2004.[7] Cheney was often criticized for the Bush Administration's policies regarding the campaign against terrorism, wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) and torture.[8][9][10]\nCheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (n\u00e9e Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney. He is of predominantly English, as well as Welsh, Irish, and French Huguenot ancestry; Cheney's 8th great-grandfather, William Cheney, immigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 17th century.[11][12][13] Cheney is a very distant cousin of both Harry S. Truman and Barack Obama; the three share a common ancestor in Mareen Duvall, a Huguenot who fled from France to England in the 17th century and later settled in Maryland.[14] His father was a soil conservation agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and his mother was a softball star in the 1930s;[15] Cheney was one of three children.\nHe attended Calvert Elementary School[16][17] before his family moved to Casper, Wyoming,[18] where he attended Natrona County High School.\nHe attended Yale University, but by his own account had problems adjusting to the college, and dropped out.[19][20] Among the influential teachers from his days in New Haven was Professor H. Bradford Westerfield, whom Cheney repeatedly credited with having helped to shape his approach to foreign policy.[21] He later attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science. He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.[22]\nIn November 1962, at the age of 21, Cheney was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was arrested for DWI again the following year.[23] Cheney said that the arrests made him \"think about where I was and where I was headed. I was headed down a bad road if I continued on that course.\"[24]\nIn 1964, he married Lynne Vincent, his high school sweetheart, whom he had met at age 14.\nWhen Cheney became eligible for the draft, during the Vietnam War, he applied for and received five draft deferments. In 1989, The Washington Post writer George C. Wilson interviewed Cheney as the next Secretary of Defense; when asked about his deferments, Cheney reportedly said, \"I had other priorities in the '60s than military service.\"[25] Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub-par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Upon graduation, Cheney was eligible for the draft, but at the time, the Selective Service System was not inducting married men.[26] On October 6, 1965, the draft was expanded to include married men without children; Cheney's first daughter, Elizabeth, was born 9 months and two days later.[27][26] Cheney's fifth and final deferment granted him \"3-A\" status, a \"hardship\" deferment available to men with dependents. In January 1967, Cheney turned 26 and was no longer eligible for the draft.[27]\nIn 1966 Cheney dropped out of the doctoral program at the University of Wisconsin to work as staff aide for Gov. Warren Knowles.[28]\nIn 1968 Cheney was awarded an American Political Science Association congressional fellowship and moved to Washington.[28]\nCheney's political career began in 1969, as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969 to 1970.[23] He held several positions in the years that followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971 to 1973, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974 to 1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.[29][30]\nCheney was Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Chief of Staff under Gerald Ford.[31] When Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense, Cheney became White House Chief of Staff, succeeding Rumsfeld.[23] He later was campaign manager for Ford's 1976 presidential campaign.[32]\nIn 1978, Cheney was elected to represent Wyoming in the U.S. House of Representatives and succeeded retiring Democratic Congressman Teno Roncalio, having defeated his Democratic opponent, Bill Bagley. Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989.\nIn 1987, he was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference. The following year, he was elected House Minority Whip.[33] He served for two and a half months before he was appointed Secretary of Defense instead of former U.S. Senator John G. Tower, whose nomination had been rejected by the U.S. Senate in March 1989.[34]\nHe voted against the creation of the U.S. Department of Education, citing his concern over budget deficits and expansion of the federal government, and claiming that the Department was an encroachment on states' rights.[35] He voted against funding Head Start, but reversed his position in 2000.[36]\nCheney initially voted in 1978 against establishing a national holiday in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., but supported creation of the holiday five years later in 1983.[37]\nCheney supported Bob Michel's (R-IL) bid to become Republican Minority Leader.[38] In April 1980, Cheney endorsed Governor Ronald Reagan for President, becoming one of Reagan's earliest supporters.[39]\nAfter the resignation of James G. Watt as Interior Secretary in 1983, Cheney was a top candidate to succeed him, but Reagan appointed William Clark instead.\nIn 1986, after President Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to impose economic sanctions on South Africa for its policy of apartheid, Cheney was one of 83 Representatives to vote against overriding Reagan's veto.[40] In later years, he articulated his opposition to unilateral sanctions against many different countries, stating \"they almost never work\"[41] and that in that case they might have ended up hurting the people instead.[42]\nIn 1986, Cheney, along with 145 Republicans and 31 Democrats, voted against a non-binding Congressional resolution calling on the South African government to release Nelson Mandela from prison, after the Democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required Mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the African National Congress (ANC) and requiring it to oust the communist faction from its leadership; the resolution was defeated. Appearing on CNN, Cheney addressed criticism for this, saying he opposed the resolution because the ANC \"at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and had a number of interests that were fundamentally inimical to the United States.\"[43]\nThe federal building in Casper, a regional center of the fossil fuel industry, is named the Dick Cheney Federal Building.[44][45]\nOriginally declining, U.S. Congressman Barber Conable persuaded Cheney to join the moderate Republican Wednesday Group in order to move up the leadership ranks. He was elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987. Cheney was the Ranking Member of the Select Committee to investigate the Iran-Contra Affair.[23][46][47]\nHe promoted Wyoming's petroleum and coal businesses as well.[48]\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Cheney for the office of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S. Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position.[49] The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0[49] and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993. He directed the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. In 1991, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush.[33][50] Later that year, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[51]\nCheney has said his time at the Pentagon was the most rewarding period of his public service career, calling it \"the one that stands out.\" In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. \"My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war,\" Cheney said, \"and it occurred to me as I was in the room as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military.\"[52]\nCheney worked closely with Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the beginning of his tenure. He focused primarily on external matters, and left most of the internal DoD management to Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood.[34]\nCheney's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup at the height of the Cold War.[53] As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics.[34] Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.[54]\nWhen the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the House Armed Services Committee's recommendation.[34]\nIn subsequent years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.[34]\nOver his four years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993.[34] Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed the development of a Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.[55]\nCheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.[34]\nCheney's views on NATO reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin.[34] Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.[56]\nCheney persuaded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war planes in the nation. This was an important element of the success of the Gulf War, as well as a lightning-rod for Islamists, such as Osama bin Laden, who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.[57]\nUsing economic sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor.[34] In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties.[58] Although the mission was controversial,[59] U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.[60]\nIn 1991, the Somali Civil War drew the world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide humanitarian assistance, primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched the first of 26,000 U.S. troops to Somalia as part of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), designed to provide security and food relief.[34] Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin and William J. Perry, had to contend with both the Bosnian and Somali issues.\nOn August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent the invading Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation.[61] An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border.[34] The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.\nCheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale U.S. military operation. According to General Colin Powell, Cheney \"had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy. He spent hours in the National Military Command Center peppering my staff with questions.\"[34]\nShortly after the Iraqi invasion, Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested U.S. military assistance. The United Nations took action as well, passing a series of resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the UN Security Council authorized \"all means necessary\" to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by January 15, 1991.[61] By then, the United States had a force of about 500,000 stationed in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Other nations, including Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Syria, and Egypt, contributed troops, and other allies, most notably Germany and Japan, agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort, named Operation Desert Shield.[34]\nOn January 12, 1991, Congress authorized Bush to use military force to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions on Kuwait.[61]\nThe first phase of Operation Desert Storm, which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraqi forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including the cities of Baghdad and Basra. Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war.[34] He flew with Powell to the region to review and finalize the ground war plans.[61]\nAfter an air offensive of more than five weeks, UN Coalition forces launched the ground war on February 24. Within 100 hours, Iraqi forces had been routed from Kuwait and Schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective\u2014expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait\u2014had been met on February 27.[62] After consultation with Cheney and other members of his national security team, Bush declared a suspension of hostilities.[61] On working with this national security team, Cheney has said, \"there have been five Republican presidents since\nEisenhower. I worked for four of them and worked closely with a fifth\u2014the Reagan years when I was part\nof the House leadership. The best national security team I ever saw was that one. The least friction, the\nmost cooperation, the highest degree of trust among the principals, especially.\"[63]\nA total of 147 U.S. military personnel died in combat, and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes.[34][62] Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6.[34] There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces.[34] Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon.[64][65] In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad. Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a \"bad idea\" and would have led to a \"quagmire\", explaining that:\nBecause if we'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it\u2014eastern Iraq\u2014the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families\u2014it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.[66][67]\nCheney regarded the Gulf War as an example of the kind of regional problem the United States was likely to continue to face in the future.[68]\nWe're always going to have to be involved [in the Middle East]. Maybe it's part of our national character, you know we like to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up, put a ribbon around it. You deploy a force, you win the war and the problem goes away. But it doesn't work that way in the Middle East. It never has, and isn't likely to in my lifetime.\nBetween 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney was a director of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization.[69]\nWith the new Democratic administration under President Bill Clinton in January 1993, Cheney left the Department of Defense and joined the American Enterprise Institute. He also served a second term as a Council on Foreign Relations director from 1993 to 1995.[69] From 1995 until 2000, he served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton, a Fortune 500 company.\nCheney's record as CEO was subject to some dispute among Wall Street analysts. A 1998 merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries attracted the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency.[70] Although Cheney is not named as an individual defendant in the suit, Halliburton shareholders are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated its stock price during this period. In June 2011, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case to continue in litigation.[71] Cheney was named in a December 2010 corruption complaint filed by the Nigerian government against Halliburton, which the company settled for $250 million.[72]\nDuring Cheney's term, Halliburton changed its accounting practices regarding revenue realization of disputed costs on major construction projects.[73] Cheney resigned as CEO of Halliburton on July 25, 2000. As vice president, he argued that this step, along with establishing a trust and other actions, removed any conflict of interest.[74] Cheney's net worth, estimated to be between $19 million and $86 million,[75]\nis largely derived from his post at Halliburton.[76]\nHis 2006 gross joint income with his wife was nearly $8.82 million.[77]\nHe was also a member of the board of advisors of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) before becoming vice president.[57]\nIn early 2000, while serving as the CEO of Halliburton, Cheney headed then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush's vice-presidential search committee. On July 25, after reviewing Cheney's findings, Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket.[23][78] Halliburton reportedly reached agreement on July 20 to allow Cheney to retire, with a package estimated at $20 million.[79]\nA few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for \"an inhabitant of the same state with themselves\"[80] for both President and Vice President.\nCheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential election. While the election was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet.[81] According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[82]\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks, Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons. For a period, Cheney stayed at a variety of undisclosed locations, out of public view.[83] Cheney later revealed in his memoir In My Time that these \"undisclosed locations\" included his official Vice Presidential residence, his home in Wyoming, and Camp David.[84] He also utilized a heavy security detail, employing a motorcade of 12 to 18 government vehicles for his daily commute from the Vice Presidential residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory to the White House.[85]\nOn the morning of June 29, 2002, Cheney served as acting president from 11:09 am to 1:24 pm, under the terms of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, while Bush was undergoing a colonoscopy.[86][87]\nFollowing 9/11, Cheney was instrumental in providing a primary justification for a renewed war against Iraq. Cheney helped shape Bush's approach to the \"War on Terror\", making numerous public statements alleging Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction,[88] and making several personal visits to CIA headquarters, where he questioned mid-level agency analysts on their conclusions.[89] Cheney continued to allege links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, even though President Bush received a classified President's Daily Brief on September 21, 2001, indicating the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that \"there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda.\"[90] Furthermore, in 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded that there was no \"collaborative relationship\" between Iraq and al-Qaeda.[91] By 2014, Cheney continued to misleadingly claim that Saddam \"had a 10-year relationship with al Qaeda.\"[92]\nFollowing the US invasion of Iraq, Cheney remained steadfast in his support of the war, stating that it would be an \"enormous success story\",[93] and made many visits to the country. He often criticized war critics, calling them \"opportunists\" who were peddling \"cynical and pernicious falsehoods\" to gain political advantage while US soldiers died in Iraq. In response, Senator John Kerry asserted, \"It is hard to name a government official with less credibility on Iraq [than Cheney].\"[94]\nIn a March 24, 2008, extended interview conducted in Ankara, Turkey, with ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz on the fifth anniversary of the original U.S. military assault on Iraq, Cheney responded to a question about public opinion polls showing that Americans had lost confidence in the war by simply replying \"So?\"[95] This remark prompted widespread criticism, including from former Oklahoma Republican Congressman Mickey Edwards, a long-time personal friend of Cheney.[96]\nBush and Cheney were re-elected in the 2004 presidential election, running against John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards. During the election, the pregnancy of his daughter Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney in light of the same-sex marriage debate.[97] Cheney has stated that he is in favor of gay marriages personally, but that each individual U.S. state should decide whether to permit it or not.[98]\nCheney's former chief legal counsel, David Addington,[99] became his chief of staff and remained in that office until Cheney's departure from office. John P. Hannah served as Cheney's national security adviser.[100]\nUntil his indictment and resignation[101] in 2005, I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Jr. served in both roles.[102]\nOn the morning of July 21, 2007, Cheney once again served as acting president, from 7:16\u00a0am to 9:21\u00a0am. Bush transferred the power of the presidency prior to undergoing a medical procedure, requiring sedation, and later resumed his powers and duties that same day.[103]\nAfter his term began in 2001, Cheney was occasionally asked if he was interested in the Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term and he did not run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator John McCain.[104]\nCheney was a prominent member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG),[105] commonly known as the Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives. After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.[106]\nBeginning in 2003, Cheney's staff opted not to file required reports with the National Archives and Records Administration office charged with assuring that the executive branch protects classified information, nor did it allow inspection of its record keeping.[107]\nCheney refused to release the documents, citing his executive privilege to deny congressional information requests.[108][109] Media outlets such as Time magazine and CBS News questioned whether Cheney had created a \"fourth branch of government\" that was not subject to any laws.[110] A group of historians and open-government advocates filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, asking the court to declare that Cheney's vice-presidential records are covered by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and cannot be destroyed, taken or withheld from the public without proper review.[111][112][113][114]\nOn October 18, 2005, The Washington Post reported that the vice president's office was central to the investigation of the Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal, for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was one of the figures under investigation.[115]\nFollowing an indictment, Libby resigned his positions as Cheney's chief of staff and assistant on national security affairs.\nOn September 8, 2006, Richard Armitage, former Deputy Secretary of State, publicly announced that he was the source of the revelation of Plame's status. Armitage said he was not a part of a conspiracy to reveal Plame's identity and did not know whether one existed.[116]\nIn February 2006, The National Journal reported that Libby had stated before a grand jury that his superiors, including Cheney, had authorized him to disclose classified information to the press regarding intelligence on Iraq's weapons.[117]\nOn March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted on four felony counts for obstruction of justice, perjury, and making false statements to federal investigators.[118] In his closing arguments, independent prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said that there was \"a cloud over the vice president\",[119] an apparent reference to Cheney's interview with FBI agents investigating the case, which was made public in 2009.[120] Cheney lobbied President George W. Bush vigorously and unsuccessfully to grant Libby a full presidential pardon up to the day of Barack Obama's inauguration, likening Libby to a \"soldier on the battlefield\".[121][122]\nOn February 27, 2007, at about 10\u00a0am, a suicide bomber killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target. They also claimed that Osama Bin Laden supervised the operation.[123] The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away. He reported hearing the blast, saying \"I heard a loud boom... The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate.\"[124] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban.[125]\nCheney has been characterized as the most powerful and influential Vice President in history.[126][127]\nBoth supporters and critics of Cheney regard him as a shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney[128] in addition to his office in the West Wing,[129] his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building,[130] and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).[128][131]\nCheney has actively promoted an expansion of the powers of the presidency, saying that the Bush administration's challenges to the laws which Congress passed after Vietnam and Watergate to contain and oversee the executive branch\u2014the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Presidential Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the War Powers Resolution\u2014are, in Cheney's words, \"a restoration, if you will, of the power and authority of the president\".[132][133]\nIn June 2007, The Washington Post summarized Cheney's vice presidency in a Pulitzer Prize-winning[134]\nfour-part series, based in part on interviews with former administration officials. The articles characterized Cheney not as a \"shadow\" president, but as someone who usually has the last words of counsel to the president on policies, which in many cases would reshape the powers of the presidency. When former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested to Cheney that the office was largely ceremonial, Cheney reportedly replied, \"I have a different understanding with the president.\" The articles described Cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government, indicated by the use of his own security classification and three man-sized safes in his offices.[135]\nThe articles described Cheney's influence on decisions pertaining to detention of suspected terrorists and the legal limits that apply to their questioning, especially what constitutes torture.[136] U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Colin Powell's chief of staff when he was both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the same time Cheney was Secretary of Defense, and then later when Powell was Secretary of State, stated in an in-depth interview that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld established an alternative program to interrogate post-9/11 detainees because of their mutual distrust of CIA.[137]\nThe Washington Post articles, principally written by Barton Gellman, further characterized Cheney as having the strongest influence within the administration in shaping budget and tax policy in a manner that assures \"conservative orthodoxy.\"[138] They also highlighted Cheney's behind-the-scenes influence on the Bush administration's environmental policy to ease pollution controls for power plants, facilitate the disposal of nuclear waste, open access to federal timber resources, and avoid federal constraints on greenhouse gas emissions, among other issues. The articles characterized his approach to policy formulation as favoring business over the environment.[139]\nIn June 2008, Cheney allegedly attempted to block efforts by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to strike a controversial US compromise deal with North Korea over the communist state's nuclear program.[140]\nIn July 2008, a former Environmental Protection Agency official stated publicly that Cheney's office had pushed significantly for large-scale deletions from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on the health effects of global warming \"fearing the presentation by a leading health official might make it harder to avoid regulating greenhouse gases.\"[141] In October, when the report appeared with six pages cut from the testimony, The White House stated that the changes were made due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the science. However, according to the former senior adviser on climate change to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson, Cheney's office was directly responsible for nearly half of the original testimony being deleted.[141]\nIn his role as President of the U.S. Senate, Cheney broke with the Bush Administration Department of Justice, and signed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in the case of Heller v. District of Columbia that successfully challenged gun laws in the nation's capital on Second Amendment grounds.[142]\nOn February 14, 2010, in an appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his support of waterboarding and for the torture of captured terrorist suspects, saying, \"I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program.\"[143]\nThe Washington Post reported in 2008 that Cheney purchased a home in McLean, Virginia, part of the Washington suburbs, which he was to tear down for a replacement structure. He also maintains homes in Wyoming and on Maryland's Eastern Shore.[144]\nIn July 2012, Cheney used his Wyoming home to host a private fund-raiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, which netted over $4 million in contributions from attendees for Romney's campaign.[145]\nCheney is the subject of the documentary film The World According to Dick Cheney, premiering March 15, 2013, on the Showtime television channel.[146][147][148] Cheney was also reported to be the subject of an HBO television mini-series based on Barton Gellman's 2008 book Angler[149] and the 2006 documentary The Dark Side, produced by the Public Broadcasting Service.[150]\nCheney maintained a visible public profile after leaving office,[151] being especially critical of Obama administration policies on national security.[152][153][154] In May 2009, Cheney spoke of his support for same-sex marriage, becoming one of the most prominent Republican politicians to do so. Speaking to the National Press Club, Cheney stated: \"People ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish. I do believe, historically, the way marriage has been regulated is at a state level. It's always been a state issue, and I think that's the way it ought to be handled today.\"[155] In 2012, Cheney reportedly encouraged several Maryland state legislators to vote to legalize same-sex marriage in that state.[156]\nAlthough, by custom, a former vice president unofficially receives six months of protection from the United States Secret Service, President Obama reportedly extended the protection period for Cheney.[157]\nOn July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta told the Senate and House intelligence committees that the CIA withheld information about a secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year.[158] The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.[159]\nCheney has said that the Tea Party Movement is a \"positive influence on the Republican Party\" and that \" I think it's much better to have that kind of turmoil and change in the Republican Party than it would be to have it outside.\"[160]\nCheney said that Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections  could be considered \"an act of war\".[161]\nFollowing the swearing-in of his daughter Liz in his former congressional seat in January 2017, Cheney said he believed she would do well in the position and that he would only offer advice if requested.[162]\nCheney has publicly criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election. On December 29, 2009, four days after the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from the Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized Obama: \"[We] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe. ... Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency\u2014social transformation\u2014the restructuring of American society.\"[163] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, \"[I]t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer.\"[164][165]\nDuring a February 14, 2010 appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration's policies for handling suspected terrorists, criticizing the \"mindset\" of treating \"terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts as opposed to acts of war\".[143]\nIn a May 2, 2011, interview with ABC News, Cheney praised the Obama administration for the covert military operation in Pakistan that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.[166]\nIn 2014, during an interview with Sean Hannity, he called Barack Obama a \"weak President\" after Obama announced his plans to pull forces out of Afghanistan.[167]\nIn August 2011, Cheney published his memoir, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir, written with Liz Cheney. The book outlines Cheney's recollections of 9/11, the War on Terrorism, the 2001 War in Afghanistan, the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" and other events.[168] According to Barton Gellman, the author of Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, Cheney's book differs from publicly available records on details surrounding the NSA surveillance program.[169][170]\nIn 2015, Cheney published another book, Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, again co-authored with his daughter Liz. The book traces the history of U.S. foreign policy and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt's administration through the Obama administration. The authors tell the story of what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II.[171] Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer what they see as the solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom.[172][173]\nCheney's early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable, reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the September 11 attacks at 68 percent.[174] However, polling numbers for both him and the president gradually declined in their second terms,[174][175] with Cheney reaching his lowest point shortly before leaving office at 13 percent.[175][176] Cheney's Gallup poll figures are mostly consistent with those from other polls:[174][177]\nIn April 2007, Cheney was awarded an honorary doctorate of public service by Brigham Young University, where he delivered the commencement address.[178] His selection as commencement speaker was controversial. The college board of trustees issued a statement explaining that the invitation should be viewed \"as one extended to someone holding the high office of vice president of the United States rather than to a partisan political figure\".[179] BYU permitted a protest to occur so long as it did not \"make personal attacks against Cheney, attack (the) BYU administration, the church or the First Presidency\".[180]\nCheney has been cited as the most powerful vice president in American history.[2][3]\nCheney has been compared to Darth Vader, a characterization originated by his critics, but which was later adopted humorously by Cheney himself as well as by members of his family and staff.[181]\nAs a result of Cheney having admitted that he \"signed off\" on the so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" program,[182][183] some public officials, as well as several media outlets and advocacy groups, have called for his prosecution under various anti-torture and war crimes statutes.[184][185]\nIn Jon Meacham's book Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush, published in November 2015, the 41st president, although also laudatory of Cheney, is in part critical of the former vice president, whom Bush describes as \"having his own empire\" and \"very hard-line.\"[186]\nCheney is a member of the United Methodist Church[191] and was the first Methodist vice president to serve under a Methodist president.[192]\nHis wife, Lynne, was chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to 1996. She is now a public speaker, author, and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\nThe couple have two children, Elizabeth \"Liz\" and Mary Cheney, and seven grandchildren. Liz, congresswoman from Wyoming since 2017, is married to Philip J. Perry, a former General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security. Mary, a former employee of the Colorado Rockies baseball team and the Coors Brewing Company, was a campaign aide to the Bush re-election campaign; she lives in Great Falls, Virginia, with her wife Heather Poe.[193] Cheney has publicly supported gay marriage since leaving the vice presidency.[194]\nCheney has a pet dog named Nelson.[195][196][197]\nCheney's long histories of cardiovascular disease and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office.[198] Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years,[199] Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle.[200][201] He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.[200]\nOn September 24, 2005, Cheney underwent a six-hour endo-vascular procedure to repair popliteal artery aneurysms bilaterally, a catheter treatment technique used in the artery behind each knee.[202] The condition was discovered at a regular physical in July, and was not life-threatening.[203] Cheney was hospitalized for tests after experiencing shortness of breath five months later. In late April 2006, an ultrasound revealed that the clot was smaller.[202]\nOn March 5, 2007, Cheney was treated for deep-vein thrombosis in his left leg at George Washington University Hospital after experiencing pain in his left calf. Doctors prescribed blood-thinning medication and allowed him to return to work.[204] CBS News reported that during the morning of November 26, 2007, Cheney was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and underwent treatment that afternoon.[202]\nOn July 12, 2008, Cheney underwent a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old man with a history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia.[205] On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.[206]\nOn January 19, 2009, Cheney strained his back \"while moving boxes into his new house\". As a consequence, he was in a wheelchair for two days, including his attendance at the 2009 United States presidential inauguration.[207][208]\nOn February 22, 2010, Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after experiencing chest pains. A spokesperson later said Cheney had experienced a mild heart attack after doctors had run tests.[201] On June 25, 2010, Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after reporting discomfort.[209]\nIn early July 2010, Cheney was outfitted with a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) at Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute to compensate for worsening congestive heart failure.[210] The device pumped blood continuously through his body.[211][212] He was released from Inova on August 9, 2010,[213] and had to decide whether to seek a full heart transplant.[214][215]\nThis pump was centrifugal and as a result he remained alive without a pulse for nearly fifteen months.[216]\nOn March 24, 2012, Cheney underwent a seven-hour heart transplant procedure at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Woodburn, Virginia, at the age of 71. He had been on a waiting list for more than 20 months before receiving the heart from an anonymous donor.[217][218] Cheney's principal cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, advised his patient that \"it would not be unreasonable for an otherwise healthy 71-year-old man to expect to live another 10 years\" with a transplant, saying in a family-authorized interview that he considered Cheney to be otherwise healthy.[219]\nOn February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney accidentally shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while participating in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas.[220] Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart.[221] Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.\nThe Secret Service stated that they notified the Sheriff about one hour after the shooting. Kenedy County Sheriff Ramone Salinas III stated that he first heard of the shooting at about 5:30 pm.[222] The next day, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong informed the Corpus Christi Caller-Times of the shooting.[223] Cheney had a televised interview with MSNBC News about the shooting on February 15. Both Cheney and Whittington have called the incident an accident. Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor. Whittington has since told The Washington Post that he and Cheney were not close friends but acquaintances. When asked if Cheney had apologized, Whittington declined to answer.[224]\nThe sheriff's office released a report on the shooting on February 16, 2006, and witness statements on February 22, indicating that the shooting occurred on a clear sunny day, and Whittington was shot from 30 or 40 yards (40\u00a0m) away while searching for a downed bird. Armstrong, the ranch owner, claimed that all in the hunting party were wearing blaze-orange safety gear and none had been drinking.[225] However, Cheney has acknowledged that he had one beer four or five hours prior to the shooting.[226] Although Kenedy County Sheriff's Office documents support the official story by Cheney and his party, re-creations of the incident produced by George Gongora and John Metz of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times indicated that the actual shooting distance was closer than the 30 yards claimed.[227]\nThe incident hurt Cheney's popularity standing in the polls.[228] According to polls on February 27, 2006, two weeks after the accident, Dick Cheney's approval rating had dropped 5 percentage points to 18%.[229] The incident became the subject of a number of jokes and satire.[230]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nGeorge Raymond Richard Martin[1] (born George Raymond Martin; September 20, 1948),[2] also known as GRRM,[3] is an American novelist and short story writer in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres, screenwriter, and television producer. He wrote the series of epic fantasy novels, A Song of Ice and Fire, which was adapted into the HBO series Game of Thrones (2011\u20132019). In 2005, Lev Grossman of Time called Martin \"the American Tolkien\",[4] and in 2011, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[5][6] George Raymond Martin (he adopted the confirmation name Richard at 13 years old)[2] was born on September 20, 1948,[7] in Bayonne, New Jersey,[8] the son of longshoreman Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin. On his mother's side his family used to be wealthy, and owned a successful construction business, but they lost it all in the great depression. Something Martin was reminded about every day when he passed what used to be his family's dock and house. It made him feel that even if they were poor, they came from greatness that had been taken away from them.[9] He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Janet. His mother was of half Irish ancestry.[10] He also acknowledges French, English, Welsh and German roots,[11] which were confirmed on the television series Finding Your Roots. However, while he also believed he was a quarter Italian because of who he was told was his paternal grandfather, a DNA test on the show confirmed his Irish and other ancestries but excluded any Italian ancestry, showing instead he is approximately a quarter Ashkenazi Jewish.[12] The family first lived in a house on Broadway, belonging to Martin's great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks.[10] During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of \"First Street to Fifth Street\", between his grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.[13] Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in \"sinister plots\".[14] Martin had a habit of starting \"endless stories\" that he never completed, as they didn't turn out as great as word on paper as he had imagined them in his head.[15] Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later Marist High School. While there he became an avid comic book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by Marvel Comics,[16] and later credited Stan Lee for being one of his greatest literary influences; \"Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien.\"[17] A letter Martin wrote to the editor of Fantastic Four was printed in issue No. 20 (November 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., Fantastic Four #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines;[18] he bought the first ticket to the world's first Comic-Con, held in New York in 1964.[19][20] In 1965, Martin won comic fandom's Alley Award for Best Fan Fiction for his prose superhero story \"Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier\".[21] In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in journalism from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Evanston, Illinois, graduating summa cum laude; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Medill.[22] Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin applied for and obtained conscientious objector status;[23] he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972\u20131974) as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance Foundation.[22] In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction convention in Milwaukee. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised science fiction and fantasy) not only to give speculative fiction a second look, but to write in the field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the Nebula Award for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in the Novel for their Children of the Dusk.[24] In turn, Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at Clarke University (then Clarke College). Martin \"wasn't making enough money to stay alive\" from writing and the chess tournaments, says Guthridge.[25] From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.[26] While he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author Tom Reamy in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer. When his wife graduated from Clarke in 1979, he resigned from his job, and being tired of the hard winters in Dubuque, they moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1979, which they had \"fallen in love with\" after a visit the year before on their way to the worldcon in Phoenix.[27][28] Martin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was \"The Hero\", sold to Galaxy magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award[29] and Nebula Awards was \"With Morning Comes Mistfall\", published in 1973 in Analog magazine. In 1975 his story \"...for a single yesterday\" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in Epoch, a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, Dying of the Light, was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of Star Wars had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.[30] The short stories he was able to sell in his early 20s gave him some profit, but not enough to pay his bills, which prevented him from becoming the full-time writer he wanted to be. The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed Bobby Fischer's victory in the 1972 world chess championship. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association that ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. When the chess bubble subsequently burst and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.[31][32] Martin is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); he served as the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998.[citation needed] In 1976, for Kansas City's MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers' Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers on the evening following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette \"...and Seven Times Never Kill Man\" and the novella The Storms of Windhaven, co-written with Lisa Tuttle.[33] Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined future history, known informally as \"The Thousand Worlds\" or \"The Manrealm\". In 2017, Martin recalled that he had started writing science fiction-horror hybrids in the late 1970s to disprove a statement from a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and therefore incompatible. Martin considered Sandkings (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella Nightflyers (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, Nightflyers, with a screenplay co-written by Martin.[34] Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film's small budget.[35] While not a hit at theatres, Martin believes that the film saved his career, and that everything he has written since exists in large part because of it.[36] He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, \"Night of the Vampyres\", collected in Harry Turtledove's anthology The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century (2001).[37] In 1982, Martin published a vampire novel titled Fevre Dream set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in Fevre Dream vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised Fevre Dream for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote: \"This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time\".[38] Martin followed up Fevre Dream with another horror novel, The Armageddon Rag (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of The Armageddon Rag \"essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time\", he recalled, and made him consider going into real estate instead.[39] In 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like Solomon Kane, Elric, Nicholas van Rijn and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel Black and White and Red All Over, which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of The Armageddon Rag, all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in Tuf Voyaging, which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt The Armageddon Rag into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of The Twilight Zone, Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.[14][40][41] At first he worked as staff writer for the show, and then as an executive story consultant. After the CBS series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series Max Headroom. He worked on scripts and created the show's \"Ped Xing\" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the ABC show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series Beauty and the Beast; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes. In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in Portraits of His Children. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author Wild Cards book series, which takes place in a shared universe in which a small slice of post\u2013World War II humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from Tor Books. In Second Person, Martin \"gives a personal account of the close-knit role-playing game (RPG) culture that gave rise to his Wild Cards shared-world anthologies\".[42] An important element in the creation of the multiple author series was a campaign of Chaosium's role-playing game Superworld (1983) that Martin ran in Albuquerque.[43] Admitting he became completely obsessed with the game, he stopped writing literature for most of 1983, which he refers to as his \"lost year\", but his shrinking bank accounts made him realize he had to come up with something, and got the idea that perhaps the stories and characters created in Superworld could somehow become profitable.[44] Martin's own contributions to Wild Cards have included Thomas Tudbury, \"The Great and Powerful Turtle\", a powerful psychokinetic whose flying \"shell\" consisted of an armored VW Beetle. As of June\u00a02011[update], 21 Wild Cards volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, Low Ball (2014), published by Tor Books. In early 2012, Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd Wild Cards volume, High Stakes, which was released in August 2016.[45] In August 2016 Martin announced that Universal Cable Productions had acquired the rights to adapt the Wild Cards novels into a television series.[46] In 2017, Martin confirmed he would serve as an executive producer of the HBO television series adaptation of the 2010 novel Who Fears Death by Nnedi Okorafor.[47] Martin also contributed to an upcoming video game titled Elden Ring, writing the worldbuilding aspects for it.[48][49] In 1991, Martin briefly returned to writing novels. He had grown frustrated that his TV pilots and screenplays were not getting made[50] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.[51] This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising his imagination.[50] Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.[52] His epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, The Accursed Kings[53] and Ivanhoe. Though Martin originally conceptualized it as being three volumes,[54] it is currently slated to comprise seven. The first, A Game of Thrones, was published in 1996, followed by A Clash of Kings in 1998 and A Storm of Swords in 2000. In November 2005, A Feast for Crows, the fourth novel in this series, became The New York Times No. 1 Bestseller.[55] The fifth book, A Dance with Dragons, was published July 12, 2011, and became an international bestseller, including achieving a No. 1 spot on the New York Times Bestseller List[56] and many others; it remained on the New York Times list for 88 weeks. In 2012, A Dance With Dragons made the final ballot for science fiction and fantasy's Hugo Award,[57] World Fantasy Award,[58] Locus Poll Award, and the British Fantasy Award;[59] the novel went on to win the Locus Poll Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[60] Two more novels are planned in the series: The Winds of Winter and the final volume A Dream of Spring. On April 25, 2018, Martin announced the release date of his new book, Fire & Blood, dealing with the history of House Targaryen, which was released on November 20, 2018.[61] HBO Productions purchased the television rights for the A Song of Ice and Fire series in 2007 and began airing the fantasy series on their US premium cable channel on April 17, 2011. Titled Game of Thrones, it ran weekly for ten episodes, each approximately an hour long.[62] Although busy completing A Dance With Dragons and other projects, George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the production of the television series adaptation of his books. Martin's involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The series was renewed shortly after the first episode aired. The first season was nominated for 13 Emmy Awards, ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for Peter Dinklage as Best Supporting Actor. The first season was also nominated for a 2012 Hugo Award, fantasy and science fiction's oldest award, presented by the World Science Fiction Society each year at the annual Worldcon; the show went on to win the 2012 Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form, at Chicon 7, the 70th World Science Fiction Convention. Martin took home one of the three Hugo Award trophies awarded in that collaborative category, the other two going to Game of Thrones show-runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. The second season, based on the second A Song of Ice and Fire novel A Clash of Kings, began airing on HBO in the US on April 1, 2012. The second season was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards, including another Supporting Actor nomination for Dinklage. It went on to win six of those Emmys in the Technical Arts categories, which were awarded the week before the regular televised 2012 awards show. The second-season episode \"Blackwater\", written by Martin, was nominated the following year for the 2013 Hugo Award in the Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form category; that episode went on to win the Hugo Award at LoneStarCon 3, the 71st World Science Fiction Convention. In addition to Martin, show-runners Benioff and Weiss (who contributed several scenes to the final screenplay) and episode director Neil Marshal (who expanded the scope of the episode on set) received Hugo statuettes. Seasons 5 and 6 each won a dozen Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series.[63] By the end of 2016, all seasons up to season 6 (which premiered on April 24, 2016) had been aired on HBO and all seasons had been released on DVD and/or Blu-ray[64] for home viewing (see List of Game of Thrones episodes). The company confirmed on July 18, 2016 that season 7 would consist of seven episodes instead of the usual ten, and would premiere later than usual, in mid-2017, because of the later filming schedule. This was necessary in order to be shooting during the winter season in Europe.[65] Season 7 was expected to air in mid 2017. The first footage from the season was revealed in a new promotional video that featured clips from its new and returning original shows for the coming year on November 28, 2016, showcasing Jon Snow, Sansa Stark and Arya Stark.[66][67] Like the previous season, it would largely consist of original content not found in Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, but also adapts material from the upcoming sixth and seventh novels: The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring.[68] For season 8, in November 2016, President of Programming Casey Bloys indicated that he had had preliminary discussions about a prequel spinoff to the Game of Thrones series with Martin.[69] In May 2017, HBO commissioned five screenwriters \u2013 Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and Bryan Cogman \u2013 to develop individual spin-offs. All of the writers are to be working individually with Martin.[70][71] According to Casey Bloys, Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts.[72] The first episode of season 8 was broadcast on April 14, 2019.[73] This season had a total of six episodes. Martin's work has been described as having \"complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing\" by literary critic Jeff VanderMeer.[74] Dana Jennings of the New York Times described Martin's work as \"fantasy for grown ups\"[75] and Lev Grossman wrote that it was dark and cynical.[76] Martin's first novel, Dying of the Light, set the tone for some of his future work; it unfolds on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story has a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to idealisms in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of tragic heroes or antiheroes in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: \"Let it never be said Martin doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic.\"[77] The overall gloominess of A Song of Ice and Fire can be an obstacle for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, \"If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you're looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere.\"[78] However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of \"realness\" and \"completeness\"\u2013including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out:There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.[77]Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire: \"The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates.\"[79] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: \"when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps\".[80] In distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic \"good versus evil\" dichotomy, for which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized. Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent \"heroic knights and chivalry\" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien's themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as \"Disneyland Middle Ages\",[81] which gloss over or ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements. Martin has been described as \"the American Tolkien\" by literary critics.[82] While Martin finds inspiration in Tolkien's legacy,[83] he aims to go beyond what he sees as Tolkien's \"medieval philosophy\" of \"if the king was a good man, the land would prosper\" to delve into the complexities, ambiguities, and vagaries of real-life power: \"We look at real history and it's not that simple\u00a0... Just having good intentions doesn't make you a wise king.\"[84] Per this fact Martin has been credited with the rise of grimdark fantasy, a modern form of an \"anti-Tolkien\" approach to fantasy writing which,[85] according to British science fiction and fantasy novelist Adam Roberts, is characterized by its reaction to Tolkien's idealism even though it owes a lot to Tolkien's work.[86][87] The Canadian fantasy writer R. Scott Bakker \"says he wouldn't have been able to publish his fantasy novels without the success George R. R. Martin achieved first\".[88] Similarly, Mark Lawrence, author of Prince of Thorns, was inspired by Martin and impressed by his Red Wedding scene.[89] The author makes a point of grounding his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies[90] that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as A Song of Ice and Fire is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward,[91] not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; \"If you look at The Lord of the Rings, what strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it's kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series.\"[92] Martin's ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner,[93] he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.[94] In 2018, Martin called The Lord of the Rings, The Great Gatsby, Gone with the Wind, Great Expectations, Lonesome Dove, Catch-22, and Charlotte's Web \"favorites all, towering masterpieces, books that changed my life\".[95] Martin actively contributes to his blog, Not a Blog; in April 2018 he moved his blog from Livejournal to his own website.[96] He still does all his \"writing on an old DOS machine running Wordstar 4.0\".[97] Martin is known for his regular attendance at science fiction conventions and comics conventions, and his accessibility to fans. In the early 1980s, critic and writer Thomas Disch identified Martin as a member of the \"Labor Day Group\", writers who regularly congregated at the annual Worldcon, usually held on or around the Labor Day weekend. Since the early 1970s, he has also attended regional science fiction conventions, and since 1986 Martin has participated annually in Albuquerque's smaller regional convention Bubonicon, near his New Mexico home.[98][99] He was the Guest of Honor at the 61st World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto, held in 2003.[100][101] In December 2016, Martin was a key speaker at the Guadalajara International Book Fair 2016 in Mexico where the author provided hints about the next two books in the series A Song of Ice and Fire.[102] Martin's official fan club is the \"Brotherhood Without Banners\", which has a regular posting board at the Forum of the website westeros.org, which is focused on his A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series. At the annual World Science Fiction Convention every year, the Brotherhood Without Banners hosts a large, on-going hospitality suite that is open to all members of the Worldcon.[103] Martin has been criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, A Feast for Crows (2005), and the fifth volume, A Dance with Dragons (2011).[104][105] The previous year, in 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his A Song of Ice and Fire series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have always been part of his working process.[106] Writer Neil Gaiman famously wrote on his blog in 2009 to a critic of Martin's pace, \"George R. R. Martin is not your bitch\". Gaiman later went on to state that writers are not machines and that they have every right to work on other projects if they want to.[107] Martin is opposed to fan fiction, which he views as copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers in terms of developing skills in worldbuilding and character development.[108][109] In the early 1970s, Martin was in a relationship with fellow science fiction/fantasy author Lisa Tuttle, with whom he co-wrote Windhaven.[110] While attending an East Coast science fiction convention he met his first wife, Gale Burnick; they were married in 1975. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979, without issue.[111] On February 15, 2011, Martin married his longtime partner Parris McBride during a small ceremony at their Santa Fe home. On August 19, 2011, they held a larger wedding ceremony and reception at Renovation, the 69th World Science Fiction Convention.[112] He and McBride are supporters of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in New Mexico.[113] In early 2013, he purchased Santa Fe's Jean Cocteau Cinema and Coffee House, which had been closed since 2006. He had the property completely restored, including both its original 35\u00a0mm capability to which was added digital projection and sound; the Cocteau officially reopened for business on August 9, 2013.[114] In 2019 he opened a bookstore named Beastly Books, after Beauty and the Beast, next to Jean Cocteau.[115] Martin has also supported Meow Wolf, an arts collective in Santa Fe, having pledged $2.7 million towards a new art-space in January 2015.[116][117] In response to a question on his religious views, Martin replied: \"I suppose I'm a lapsed Catholic. You would consider me an atheist or agnostic. I find religion and spirituality fascinating. I would like to believe this isn't the end and there's something more, but I can't convince the rational part of me that makes any sense whatsoever.\"[118] Martin is a fan of the New York Jets, the New York Giants and the New York Mets.[119][120][121] He is also a fan of the Grateful Dead, and says that the band's music may have influenced his work.[122] Martin made a guest appearance as himself in an episode, \"El Skeletorito\", of the Adult Swim show Robot Chicken.[123] He also appeared in SyFy's Z Nation as a zombie version of himself in season two's \"The Collector\", where he is still signing copies of his new novel.[124][125] In Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!, he is killed when watching a movie at the theatre.[126] In 2014, Martin launched a campaign on Prizeo to raise funds for Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe. As part of the campaign, Martin offered one donor the chance to accompany him on a trip to the wolf sanctuary, including a helicopter ride and dinner. Martin also offered those donating $20,000 or more the opportunity to have a character named after them and \"killed off\" in an upcoming A Song of Ice and Fire novel. The campaign garnered media attention and raised a total of $502,549.[127][128] In 2017, Martin announced that he was funding The Miskatonic Scholarship. The Miskatonic Scholarship allows a writer of Lovecraftian cosmic horror to attend the Odyssey workshop, a six-week writing workshop held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.[129][130] Growing up, Martin avoided the draft to the Vietnam War by being a conscientious objector and did two years of alternative service. He generally opposes war and thought the Vietnam War was a \"terrible mistake for America\". He has also written against the glory of war and tries to realistically describe war in his books.[131] In 2014, Martin endorsed Democratic Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico.[132] In the midst of pressure to pull the 2014 feature film The Interview from theatres, the Jean Cocteau Theatre in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which has been owned by Martin since 2013, decided to show the film. Theatre manager Jon Bowman told the Santa Fe New Mexican: \"Martin feels strongly about the First Amendment and the idea of artists having the ability to speak their minds and not having to worry about being targets.\"[133] On November 20, 2015, writing on his LiveJournal blog, Martin advocated for allowing Syrian refugees into the United States.[134] Immediately following Bernie Sanders' defeat in the U.S. Democratic primary election, he supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general 2016 United States presidential election, and criticized Donald Trump during the election and following her defeat, commenting that Trump would \"become the worst president in American history\".[135][136][137][138] In May 2019, Martin endorsed Joe Biden for President in 2020.[139]",

He wrote the series of epic fantasy novels, A Song of Ice and Fire, which was adapted into the HBO series Game of Thrones (2011\u20132019).\nIn 2005, Lev Grossman of Time called Martin \"the American Tolkien\",[4] and in 2011, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[5][6]\nGeorge Raymond Martin (he adopted the confirmation name Richard at 13 years old)[2] was born on September 20, 1948,[7] in Bayonne, New Jersey,[8] the son of longshoreman Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin. On his mother's side his family used to be wealthy, and owned a successful construction business, but they lost it all in the great depression. Something Martin was reminded about every day when he passed what used to be his family's dock and house. It made him feel that even if they were poor, they came from greatness that had been taken away from them.[9] He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Janet. His mother was of half Irish ancestry.[10] He also acknowledges French, English, Welsh and German roots,[11] which were confirmed on the television series Finding Your Roots. However, while he also believed he was a quarter Italian because of who he was told was his paternal grandfather, a DNA test on the show confirmed his Irish and other ancestries but excluded any Italian ancestry, showing instead he is approximately a quarter Ashkenazi Jewish.[12]\nThe family first lived in a house on Broadway, belonging to Martin's great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks.[10] During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of \"First Street to Fifth Street\", between his grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.[13] Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in \"sinister plots\".[14] Martin had a habit of starting \"endless stories\" that he never completed, as they didn't turn out as great as word on paper as he had imagined them in his head.[15]\nMartin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later Marist High School. While there he became an avid comic book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by Marvel Comics,[16] and later credited Stan Lee for being one of his greatest literary influences; \"Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien.\"[17] A letter Martin wrote to the editor of Fantastic Four was printed in issue No. 20 (November 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., Fantastic Four #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines;[18] he bought the first ticket to the world's first Comic-Con, held in New York in 1964.[19][20] In 1965, Martin won comic fandom's Alley Award for Best Fan Fiction for his prose superhero story \"Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier\".[21]\nIn 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in journalism from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Evanston, Illinois, graduating summa cum laude; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Medill.[22] Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin applied for and obtained conscientious objector status;[23] he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972\u20131974) as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance Foundation.[22]\nIn the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction convention in Milwaukee. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised science fiction and fantasy) not only to give speculative fiction a second look, but to write in the field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the Nebula Award for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in the Novel for their Children of the Dusk.[24]\nIn turn, Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at Clarke University (then Clarke College). Martin \"wasn't making enough money to stay alive\" from writing and the chess tournaments, says Guthridge.[25] From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.[26]\nWhile he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author Tom Reamy in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer. When his wife graduated from Clarke in 1979, he resigned from his job, and being tired of the hard winters in Dubuque, they moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1979, which they had \"fallen in love with\" after a visit the year before on their way to the worldcon in Phoenix.[27][28]\nMartin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was \"The Hero\", sold to Galaxy magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award[29] and Nebula Awards was \"With Morning Comes Mistfall\", published in 1973 in Analog magazine. In 1975 his story \"...for a single yesterday\" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in Epoch, a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, Dying of the Light, was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of Star Wars had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.[30]\nThe short stories he was able to sell in his early 20s gave him some profit, but not enough to pay his bills, which prevented him from becoming the full-time writer he wanted to be. The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed Bobby Fischer's victory in the 1972 world chess championship. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association that ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. When the chess bubble subsequently burst and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.[31][32]\nMartin is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); he served as the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998.[citation needed] In 1976, for Kansas City's MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers' Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers on the evening following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette \"...and Seven Times Never Kill Man\" and the novella The Storms of Windhaven, co-written with Lisa Tuttle.[33] Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined future history, known informally as \"The Thousand Worlds\" or \"The Manrealm\".\nIn 2017, Martin recalled that he had started writing science fiction-horror hybrids in the late 1970s to disprove a statement from a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and therefore incompatible. Martin considered Sandkings (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella Nightflyers (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, Nightflyers, with a screenplay co-written by Martin.[34] Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film's small budget.[35] While not a hit at theatres, Martin believes that the film saved his career, and that everything he has written since exists in large part because of it.[36] He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, \"Night of the Vampyres\", collected in Harry Turtledove's anthology The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century (2001).[37]\nIn 1982, Martin published a vampire novel titled Fevre Dream set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in Fevre Dream vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D'Amassa has praised Fevre Dream for its strong 19th century atmosphere and wrote: \"This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time\".[38] Martin followed up Fevre Dream with another horror novel, The Armageddon Rag (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of The Armageddon Rag \"essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time\", he recalled, and made him consider going into real estate instead.[39]\nIn 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like Solomon Kane, Elric, Nicholas van Rijn and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel Black and White and Red All Over, which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of The Armageddon Rag, all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in Tuf Voyaging, which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt The Armageddon Rag into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of The Twilight Zone, Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.[14][40][41] At first he worked as staff writer for the show, and then as an executive story consultant. After the CBS series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series Max Headroom. He worked on scripts and created the show's \"Ped Xing\" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the ABC show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series Beauty and the Beast; in 1989, he became the show's co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.\nIn 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in Portraits of His Children. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author Wild Cards book series, which takes place in a shared universe in which a small slice of post\u2013World War II humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from Tor Books. In Second Person, Martin \"gives a personal account of the close-knit role-playing game (RPG) culture that gave rise to his Wild Cards shared-world anthologies\".[42] An important element in the creation of the multiple author series was a campaign of Chaosium's role-playing game Superworld (1983) that Martin ran in Albuquerque.[43] Admitting he became completely obsessed with the game, he stopped writing literature for most of 1983, which he refers to as his \"lost year\", but his shrinking bank accounts made him realize he had to come up with something, and got the idea that perhaps the stories and characters created in Superworld could somehow become profitable.[44] Martin's own contributions to Wild Cards have included Thomas Tudbury, \"The Great and Powerful Turtle\", a powerful psychokinetic whose flying \"shell\" consisted of an armored VW Beetle. As of June\u00a02011[update], 21 Wild Cards volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, Low Ball (2014), published by Tor Books. In early 2012, Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd Wild Cards volume, High Stakes, which was released in August 2016.[45]\nIn August 2016 Martin announced that Universal Cable Productions had acquired the rights to adapt the Wild Cards novels into a television series.[46] In 2017, Martin confirmed he would serve as an executive producer of the HBO television series adaptation of the 2010 novel Who Fears Death by Nnedi Okorafor.[47] Martin also contributed to an upcoming video game titled Elden Ring, writing the worldbuilding aspects for it.[48][49]\nIn 1991, Martin briefly returned to writing novels. He had grown frustrated that his TV pilots and screenplays were not getting made[50] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.[51] This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising his imagination.[50] Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.[52]\nHis epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, The Accursed Kings[53] and Ivanhoe. Though Martin originally conceptualized it as being three volumes,[54] it is currently slated to comprise seven. The first, A Game of Thrones, was published in 1996, followed by A Clash of Kings in 1998 and A Storm of Swords in 2000. In November 2005, A Feast for Crows, the fourth novel in this series, became The New York Times No. 1 Bestseller.[55] The fifth book, A Dance with Dragons, was published July 12, 2011, and became an international bestseller, including achieving a No. 1 spot on the New York Times Bestseller List[56] and many others; it remained on the New York Times list for 88 weeks. In 2012, A Dance With Dragons made the final ballot for science fiction and fantasy's Hugo Award,[57] World Fantasy Award,[58] Locus Poll Award, and the British Fantasy Award;[59] the novel went on to win the Locus Poll Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[60] Two more novels are planned in the series: The Winds of Winter and the final volume A Dream of Spring. On April 25, 2018, Martin announced the release date of his new book, Fire &amp; Blood, dealing with the history of House Targaryen, which was released on November 20, 2018.[61]\nHBO Productions purchased the television rights for the A Song of Ice and Fire series in 2007 and began airing the fantasy series on their US premium cable channel on April 17, 2011. Titled Game of Thrones, it ran weekly for ten episodes, each approximately an hour long.[62] Although busy completing A Dance With Dragons and other projects, George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the production of the television series adaptation of his books. Martin's involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The series was renewed shortly after the first episode aired.\nThe first season was nominated for 13 Emmy Awards, ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for Peter Dinklage as Best Supporting Actor.\nThe first season was also nominated for a 2012 Hugo Award, fantasy and science fiction's oldest award, presented by the World Science Fiction Society each year at the annual Worldcon; the show went on to win the 2012 Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form, at Chicon 7, the 70th World Science Fiction Convention. Martin took home one of the three Hugo Award trophies awarded in that collaborative category, the other two going to Game of Thrones show-runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.\nThe second season, based on the second A Song of Ice and Fire novel A Clash of Kings, began airing on HBO in the US on April 1, 2012. The second season was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards, including another Supporting Actor nomination for Dinklage. It went on to win six of those Emmys in the Technical Arts categories, which were awarded the week before the regular televised 2012 awards show. The second-season episode \"Blackwater\", written by Martin, was nominated the following year for the 2013 Hugo Award in the Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form category; that episode went on to win the Hugo Award at LoneStarCon 3, the 71st World Science Fiction Convention. In addition to Martin, show-runners Benioff and Weiss (who contributed several scenes to the final screenplay) and episode director Neil Marshal (who expanded the scope of the episode on set) received Hugo statuettes.\nSeasons 5 and 6 each won a dozen Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series.[63]\nBy the end of 2016, all seasons up to season 6 (which premiered on April 24, 2016) had been aired on HBO and all seasons had been released on DVD and/or Blu-ray[64] for home viewing (see List of Game of Thrones episodes). The company confirmed on July 18, 2016 that season 7 would consist of seven episodes instead of the usual ten, and would premiere later than usual, in mid-2017, because of the later filming schedule. This was necessary in order to be shooting during the winter season in Europe.[65] Season 7 was expected to air in mid 2017. The first footage from the season was revealed in a new promotional video that featured clips from its new and returning original shows for the coming year on November 28, 2016, showcasing Jon Snow, Sansa Stark and Arya Stark.[66][67] Like the previous season, it would largely consist of original content not found in Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, but also adapts material from the upcoming sixth and seventh novels: The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring.[68]\nFor season 8, in November 2016, President of Programming Casey Bloys indicated that he had had preliminary discussions about a prequel spinoff to the Game of Thrones series with Martin.[69] In May 2017, HBO commissioned five screenwriters \u2013 Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and Bryan Cogman \u2013 to develop individual spin-offs. All of the writers are to be working individually with Martin.[70][71] According to Casey Bloys, Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts.[72] The first episode of season 8 was broadcast on April 14, 2019.[73] This season had a total of six episodes.\nMartin's work has been described as having \"complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing\" by literary critic Jeff VanderMeer.[74] Dana Jennings of the New York Times described Martin's work as \"fantasy for grown ups\"[75] and Lev Grossman wrote that it was dark and cynical.[76] Martin's first novel, Dying of the Light, set the tone for some of his future work; it unfolds on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story has a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to idealisms in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of tragic heroes or antiheroes in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: \"Let it never be said Martin doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic.\"[77]\n\nThe overall gloominess of A Song of Ice and Fire can be an obstacle for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, \"If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you're looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere.\"[78] However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of \"realness\" and \"completeness\"\u2013including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out:There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.[77]Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire: \"The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates.\"[79] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: \"when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps\".[80]\nIn distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic \"good versus evil\" dichotomy, for which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized. Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent \"heroic knights and chivalry\" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien's themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as \"Disneyland Middle Ages\",[81] which gloss over or ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements. Martin has been described as \"the American Tolkien\" by literary critics.[82] While Martin finds inspiration in Tolkien's legacy,[83] he aims to go beyond what he sees as Tolkien's \"medieval philosophy\" of \"if the king was a good man, the land would prosper\" to delve into the complexities, ambiguities, and vagaries of real-life power: \"We look at real history and it's not that simple\u00a0... Just having good intentions doesn't make you a wise king.\"[84] Per this fact Martin has been credited with the rise of grimdark fantasy, a modern form of an \"anti-Tolkien\" approach to fantasy writing which,[85] according to British science fiction and fantasy novelist Adam Roberts, is characterized by its reaction to Tolkien's idealism even though it owes a lot to Tolkien's work.[86][87] The Canadian fantasy writer R. Scott Bakker \"says he wouldn't have been able to publish his fantasy novels without the success George R. R. Martin achieved first\".[88] Similarly, Mark Lawrence, author of Prince of Thorns, was inspired by Martin and impressed by his Red Wedding scene.[89]\nThe author makes a point of grounding his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies[90] that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as A Song of Ice and Fire is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward,[91] not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; \"If you look at The Lord of the Rings, what strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it's kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series.\"[92] Martin's ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner,[93] he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.[94]\nIn 2018, Martin called The Lord of the Rings, The Great Gatsby, Gone with the Wind, Great Expectations, Lonesome Dove, Catch-22, and Charlotte's Web \"favorites all, towering masterpieces, books that changed my life\".[95]\nMartin actively contributes to his blog, Not a Blog; in April 2018 he moved his blog from Livejournal to his own website.[96] He still does all his \"writing on an old DOS machine running Wordstar 4.0\".[97]\nMartin is known for his regular attendance at science fiction conventions and comics conventions, and his accessibility to fans. In the early 1980s, critic and writer Thomas Disch identified Martin as a member of the \"Labor Day Group\", writers who regularly congregated at the annual Worldcon, usually held on or around the Labor Day weekend. Since the early 1970s, he has also attended regional science fiction conventions, and since 1986 Martin has participated annually in Albuquerque's smaller regional convention Bubonicon, near his New Mexico home.[98][99] He was the Guest of Honor at the 61st World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto, held in 2003.[100][101]\nIn December 2016, Martin was a key speaker at the Guadalajara International Book Fair 2016 in Mexico where the author provided hints about the next two books in the series A Song of Ice and Fire.[102]\nMartin's official fan club is the \"Brotherhood Without Banners\", which has a regular posting board at the Forum of the website westeros.org, which is focused on his A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series. At the annual World Science Fiction Convention every year, the Brotherhood Without Banners hosts a large, on-going hospitality suite that is open to all members of the Worldcon.[103]\nMartin has been criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, A Feast for Crows (2005), and the fifth volume, A Dance with Dragons (2011).[104][105] The previous year, in 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his A Song of Ice and Fire series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have always been part of his working process.[106] Writer Neil Gaiman famously wrote on his blog in 2009 to a critic of Martin's pace, \"George R. R. Martin is not your bitch\". Gaiman later went on to state that writers are not machines and that they have every right to work on other projects if they want to.[107]\nMartin is opposed to fan fiction, which he views as copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers in terms of developing skills in worldbuilding and character development.[108][109]\nIn the early 1970s, Martin was in a relationship with fellow science fiction/fantasy author Lisa Tuttle, with whom he co-wrote Windhaven.[110]\nWhile attending an East Coast science fiction convention he met his first wife, Gale Burnick; they were married in 1975. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979, without issue.[111] On February 15, 2011, Martin married his longtime partner Parris McBride during a small ceremony at their Santa Fe home. On August 19, 2011, they held a larger wedding ceremony and reception at Renovation, the 69th World Science Fiction Convention.[112]\nHe and McBride are supporters of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in New Mexico.[113] In early 2013, he purchased Santa Fe's Jean Cocteau Cinema and Coffee House, which had been closed since 2006. He had the property completely restored, including both its original 35\u00a0mm capability to which was added digital projection and sound; the Cocteau officially reopened for business on August 9, 2013.[114] In 2019 he opened a bookstore named Beastly Books, after Beauty and the Beast, next to Jean Cocteau.[115] Martin has also supported Meow Wolf, an arts collective in Santa Fe, having pledged $2.7 million towards a new art-space in January 2015.[116][117]\nIn response to a question on his religious views, Martin replied: \"I suppose I'm a lapsed Catholic. You would consider me an atheist or agnostic. I find religion and spirituality fascinating. I would like to believe this isn't the end and there's something more, but I can't convince the rational part of me that makes any sense whatsoever.\"[118]\nMartin is a fan of the New York Jets, the New York Giants and the New York Mets.[119][120][121] He is also a fan of the Grateful Dead, and says that the band's music may have influenced his work.[122]\nMartin made a guest appearance as himself in an episode, \"El Skeletorito\", of the Adult Swim show Robot Chicken.[123] He also appeared in SyFy's Z Nation as a zombie version of himself in season two's \"The Collector\", where he is still signing copies of his new novel.[124][125] In Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!, he is killed when watching a movie at the theatre.[126]\nIn 2014, Martin launched a campaign on Prizeo to raise funds for Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe. As part of the campaign, Martin offered one donor the chance to accompany him on a trip to the wolf sanctuary, including a helicopter ride and dinner. Martin also offered those donating $20,000 or more the opportunity to have a character named after them and \"killed off\" in an upcoming A Song of Ice and Fire novel. The campaign garnered media attention and raised a total of $502,549.[127][128]\nIn 2017, Martin announced that he was funding The Miskatonic Scholarship. The Miskatonic Scholarship allows a writer of Lovecraftian cosmic horror to attend the Odyssey workshop, a six-week writing workshop held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.[129][130]\nGrowing up, Martin avoided the draft to the Vietnam War by being a conscientious objector and did two years of alternative service. He generally opposes war and thought the Vietnam War was a \"terrible mistake for America\". He has also written against the glory of war and tries to realistically describe war in his books.[131]\nIn 2014, Martin endorsed Democratic Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico.[132]\nIn the midst of pressure to pull the 2014 feature film The Interview from theatres, the Jean Cocteau Theatre in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which has been owned by Martin since 2013, decided to show the film. Theatre manager Jon Bowman told the Santa Fe New Mexican: \"Martin feels strongly about the First Amendment and the idea of artists having the ability to speak their minds and not having to worry about being targets.\"[133]\nOn November 20, 2015, writing on his LiveJournal blog, Martin advocated for allowing Syrian refugees into the United States.[134] Immediately following Bernie Sanders' defeat in the U.S. Democratic primary election, he supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general 2016 United States presidential election, and criticized Donald Trump during the election and following her defeat, commenting that Trump would \"become the worst president in American history\".[135][136][137][138]\nIn May 2019, Martin endorsed Joe Biden for President in 2020.[139]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJulian Paul Assange (/\u0259\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0n\u0292/;[5] n\u00e9 Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian editor, publisher, and activist who founded WikiLeaks in 2006. WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010),[6][7] the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.[8] In November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange,[9] after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault.[10][11] Assange denied the allegations, and said they were just a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents.[12][13] Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010 but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his \u00a3340,000 bail[14] in June 2012 to seek asylum from Ecuador.[15] In August 2012, Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and possible extradition to the United States.[16] In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship; however it was suspended in April 2019.[1] Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years.[17] During the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton from her private email server when she was Secretary of State.[18] The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts of interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread the stolen documents. Assange consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking \"a neo-McCarthy hysteria\".[19][20][21] On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested.[22] Later that day he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom.[23] On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Times criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act.[24][25] Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019,[26] but in November closed it again, saying that the evidence had weakened over time.[27] Assange is incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh, reportedly in ill health. Assange was born Julian Paul Hawkins on 3 July 1971 in Townsville, Queensland,[28][29][30] to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951),[31] a visual artist,[32]:34 and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder.[33] The couple separated before their son was born.[33] When Julian was a year old, his mother married Brett Assange,[34][35][36] an actor with whom she ran a small theatre company and whom Julian regards as his father (choosing Assange as his surname).[37] Christine had a house in Nelly Bay on Magnetic Island, where they lived from time to time until it was destroyed by fire.[29] Christine and Brett Assange divorced about 1979. Christine then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, and they had a son before breaking up in 1982.[28][38][32]:37\u201338 Julian had a nomadic childhood, living in over 30[39][40] Australian towns and cities by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne.[34][41] Assange attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979\u20131983)[37] and Townsville State High School in Queensland[42] as well as being schooled at home.[35] He studied programming, mathematics and physics at Central Queensland University (1994)[43] and the University of Melbourne (2003\u20132006),[34][44] but did not complete a degree.[45] While in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa. In 1989 they had a son, Daniel, now a software designer.[34][45][46] The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child.[35] At this time, Julian's brown hair turned white.[28] Julian was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood.[47] Julian has other children; in an open letter to then-French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, he stated that his youngest child lives in France with his mother. He also said his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.[48] In 90's Assange visited Russia and developed interest for Russian literature, mentioning Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak and Dostoyevski as his favorite authors, as well Soviet children cartoons.[49] Between 1996 and 1998, he started traveling worldwide, visiting Germany, Poland, Russia and China, meeting \"like-minded young people\", including Chaos Computer Club in Germany.[50] In 1987, aged 16, Assange began hacking under the name Mendax[35][51] (Latin for \"liar\"[52]). He and two others\u2014known as \"Trax\" and \"Prime Suspect\"\u2014formed a hacking group they called \"the International Subversives\".[35] He is thought to have been involved in the WANK (Worms Against Nuclear Killers) hack at NASA in 1989, but he does not acknowledge this.[53][32]:42 In September 1991, Assange was discovered hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel, a Canadian multinational telecommunications corporation.[35] The Australian Federal Police tapped Assange's phone line (he was using a modem), raided his home at the end of October[54] and eventually charged him in 1994 with 31 counts of hacking and related crimes.[35] In December 1996, he pleaded guilty to 24 charges (the others were dropped) and was ordered to pay reparations of A$2,100 and released on a good behaviour bond.[53][55] The perceived absence of malicious or mercenary intent and his disrupted childhood were cited to justify his lenient penalty.[55][56][57][58] In 1993, Assange gave technical advice to the Victoria Police Child Exploitation Unit that assisted in prosecutions.[59][60] In the same year, he was involved in starting one of the first public Internet service providers in Australia, Suburbia Public Access Network.[34][61] He began programming in 1994, authoring or co-authoring the TCP port scanner Strobe (1995),[62][63] patches to the open-source database PostgreSQL (1996),[64][65] the Usenet caching software NNTPCache (1996),[66] the Rubberhose deniable encryption system (1997)[67][68] (which reflected his growing interest in cryptography),[69] and Surfraw, a command-line interface for web-based search engines (2000).[70] During this period, he also moderated the AUCRYPTO forum,[69] ran Best of Security, a website \"giving advice on computer security\" that had 5,000 subscribers in 1996,[32]:45 and contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997), a book about Australian hackers, including the International Subversives.[51][71] In 1998, he co-founded the company Earthmen Technology.[58] Assange stated that he registered the domain leaks.org in 1999, but \"didn't do anything with it\".[58] He did publicise a patent granted to the National Security Agency in August 1999, for voice-data harvesting technology: \"This patent should worry people. Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived in the bowels of an unaccountable foreign spy agency.\"[69] Assange and others established WikiLeaks in 2006. Assange became a member of the organisation's advisory board[72] and described himself as the editor-in-chief.[73] From 2007 to 2010, Assange travelled continuously on WikiLeaks business, visiting Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.[35][40][74][75][76] WikiLeaks published internet censorship lists, leaks,[77] and classified media from anonymous sources, including revelations about drone strikes in Yemen, corruption across the Arab world,[78] extrajudicial executions by Kenyan police,[79] 2008 Tibetan unrest in China,[80] the \"Petrogate\" oil scandal in Peru.[81] WikiLeaks first came to international prominence in 2008,[82] when \"most of the US fourth estate\" filed an amicus curiae brief\u2014through the organisational efforts of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP)\u2014to defend Wikileaks against a DMCA request from the Swiss bank Julius Baer, which had initially been granted.[83] Later documents included leaked emails from the Turkish government published at the height of Erdo\u011fan's post-coup purges in Turkey in December 2016,[84][85] & the collection of more than two million emails from Syrian political figures, government ministries and companies. Assange said of the Syria Files that \"it helps us not merely to criticise one group or another, but to understand their interests, actions and thoughts. It is only through understanding this conflict that we can hope to resolve it.\"[86] By 2015, WikiLeaks had published more than ten million documents and associated analyses, and was described by Assange as \"a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents.\"[87] The material WikiLeaks published between 2006 and 2009 attracted various degrees of international attention,[88] but after it began publishing documents supplied by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley), WikiLeaks became a household name. The Manning material included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010)[6] which showed United States soldiers fatally shooting 18 people from a helicopter in Iraq, including journalists Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh.[7] This material also included the Afghanistan War logs (July 2010),[89] the Iraq War logs (October 2010),[90] and the Guant\u00e1namo files (April 2011).[91] Controversy surrounding WikiLeaks reached its greatest intensity after Assange published a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic cables,[92] known as the \"Cablegate\" files, in November 2010, initially working with established Western media organisations, and later with smaller regional media organisations, while also publishing the cables upon which their reporting was based.[93][94] The files showed United States espionage against United Nations and other world leaders,[95][96][97] revealed tensions between the U.S. and its allies, and exposed corruption in countries throughout the world as documented by U.S. diplomats, helping to spark the Arab Spring.[98][99] The Cablegate and Iraq and Afghan War releases impacted diplomacy and public opinion globally, with responses varying by region.[94] Opinions of Assange at this time were divided. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard described his activities as \"illegal\",[100] but the police said he had not broken Australian law.[101] United States Vice-President Joe Biden and others called him a \"terrorist\".[102][103][104][105][106] Some called for his assassination or execution.[107][108][109][110][111] Support for Assange came from Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva,[112] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa,[113] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,[114][115] British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (then a backbench MP),[116] Spanish Podemos party leader Pablo Iglesias,[117] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay,[118] and Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro.[119] He also garnered support from many leading activists and celebrities, including Tariq Ali,[120] John Perry Barlow,[121] Daniel Ellsberg,[122][123] Mary Kostakidis,[124] John Pilger,[125][126] Ai Weiwei,[127] Michael Moore,[128] Noam Chomsky,[127] Vaughan Smith,[129][130] and Oliver Stone.[131] The year 2010 culminated with the Sam Adams Award, which Assange accepted in October,[132] and a string of distinctions in December\u2014the Le Monde readers' choice award for person of the year,[133][134] the Time readers' choice award for person of the year (he was also a runner-up in Time's overall person of the year award),[135][136] a deal for his autobiography worth at least US$1.3\u00a0million,[137][138][139] and selection by the Italian edition of Rolling Stone as \"rockstar of the year\".[140] In 2011 the Walkley Foundation awarded WikiLeaks the Walkley Award for \"Most outstanding contribution to journalism\".[141] It commended WikiLeaks and Assange for their \"brave, determined and independent stand for freedom of speech and transparency that has empowered people all over the world\". Assange announced that he would run for the Australian Senate in March 2012 under the new WikiLeaks Party,[142][143] and Cypherpunks[144] was published in November. In 2012, Assange hosted a television show on RT, a network funded by the Russian government.[145] In the same year, he analysed the Kissinger cables held at the US National Archives and released them in searchable form.[146] On 15 September 2014, he appeared via remote video link on Kim Dotcom's Moment of Truth town hall meeting held in Auckland.[147] The following February, he won the Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal for Peace with Justice, previously awarded to only three people\u2014Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, and Buddhist spiritual leader Daisaku Ikeda.[148] Two weeks later, he filed for the trademark \"Julian Assange\" in Europe, which was to be used for \"Public speaking services; news reporter services; journalism; publication of texts other than publicity texts; education services; entertainment services.\"[149][150][151] For several years a member of the Australian journalists' union and still an honorary member,[152][153][154] he was awarded the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in June,[155][156] having earlier won the Amnesty International UK Media Award (New Media) in 2009.[157] On 25 November 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and internal documents that provided details on the US military operations in Yemen from 2009 to March 2015.[158][159] In a statement accompanying release of \"Yemen Files\", Assange said about the US involvement in the Yemen war: \"The war in Yemen has produced 3.15\u00a0million internally displaced persons. Although the United States government has provided most of the bombs and is deeply involved in the conduct of the war itself reportage on the war in English is conspicuously rare.\"[159] In April 2017, then CIA director Mike Pompeo, in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, called WikiLeaks \"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia\".[160] Pompeo's accusation followed a series of \"damaging leaks\" of confidential documents, codenamed Vault 7, that included details on the CIA's hacking capabilities.[161] Assange accused the CIA of trying to \"subvert\" his First Amendment rights, saying that \"History shows the danger of allowing the CIA or any intelligence agency, whose very modus operandi includes misdirection and lying, to be the sole arbiter of what is true or what is prudent. Otherwise, every day might see a repeat of the many foolish CIA actions which have led to death, displacement, dictatorship and terrorism.\"[162] In August 2017, in the midst of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, Saudi-owned newspaper Al Arabiya, based in Dubai, said that Assange \"has seven cables about Qatar and only five were published\" after Qatar negotiated with WikiLeaks. Assange responded that \"The Al Arabiya network (HQ in UAE) has been publishing increasingly absurd fabrications as the UAE v Qatar dispute continues.\"[163] A 2017 article in Foreign Policy asserted that in mid 2016 WikiLeaks turned down leaks on the Russian government during the US presidential campaign, stating \"the leak organization ignored damaging information on the Kremlin to focus on Hillary Clinton and election-related hacks\".[164] This was disputed by Wikileaks which said that as far as it could recall the material was \"already public\".[164] The cache had previously been reported on by the BBC and other news outlets to reveal details about Russian military and intelligence involvement in Ukraine.[164] The Foreign Policy article also argued that Assange's position on Russia had evolved. Assange's relationship with Russia \"started as adversarial\" as in he had in October 2010 \"teased a massive dump of documents that would expose wrongdoing in the Kremlin, teaming up with a Russian news site for the rollout\".[164] However, Assange by 2012 \"had his own show on the RT network and in 2016 Assange publicly criticised Novaya Gazeta's coverage of the Panama Papers, suggesting that \"reporters had \"cherry-picked\" the documents to publish for optimal 'Putin bashing, North Korea bashing, sanctions bashing, etc.' while giving Western figures a pass.\"[164] Russian investigative reporter Roman Shleynov said in an interview with the New York Times that it was a surprise for him to hear that \"Mr Assange was repeating the same excuse that our officials, even back in Soviet days, used to say \u2013 that it's all some conspiracy from abroad.\"[164] Assange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: \"I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgment and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ...\u00a0she certainly should not become president of the United States.\"[165] On 25 July, following the Republican National Convention (RNC), during an interview by Amy Goodman, Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. \"Personally, I would prefer neither.\"[166][167][168] WikiLeaks editor, Sarah Harrison, has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.[169] In an Election Day statement, Assange criticised both Clinton and Trump, saying that \"The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers.\"[170] It was revealed in October 2017 that during the 2016 presidential election, Cambridge Analytica funder and substantial Republican donor Rebekah Mercer had proposed creating a searchable database for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain and then forwarded this suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who personally emailed a request to Assange for Clinton's emails.[171][172] Assange responded to the report by saying he denied Nix's request.[173] In a July 2016 interview, Assange implied that Seth Rich, a DNC staffer who was murdered by an unknown assailant earlier that year, was the source behind the DNC emails that WikiLeaks published and that Seth Rich was killed for doing so. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's murder. Assange spoke about sources bringing information to WikiLeaks in the context of Seth Rich, and stated that whistle-blowers are at risk. When an interviewer said that Rich died as a result of \"just a robbery\", Assange said \"No. There's no finding.\"[174][175][176][177] Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election said that Assange \"falsely implied\" that Rich was the source to obscure that Russia was the actual source.[178][179][180] Assange's claims were highlighted by Fox News, The Washington Times and conspiracy website InfoWars.[181][182] According to a study by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, Assange's claims set off a spike in attention to the Seth Rich murder. According to the scholars, Assange's claims lent credibility and visibility to what had at that point been a conspiracy theory in the fringe parts of the Internet.[183] According to the Associated Press, the July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian officers by Special Counsel Robert Mueller undermined the idea that Seth Rich was the source for the DNC emails.[184] Similarly, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Assange knew Seth Rich could not have been his source for the hacked emails, because he continued corresponding with the Russian hackers after Rich's death.[178] On 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seemingly presenting ways to undercut Bernie Sanders and showing apparent favouritism towards Clinton, leading to the resignation of party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.[185][186] The New York Times reported that \"Assange accused Mrs. Clinton of having been among those pushing to indict him\u00a0...\" and that he had timed the release to coincide with the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[187] In an interview with Robert Peston of ITV News, Assange suggested that he saw Hillary Clinton as a personal foe.[166][188] On 4 October 2016, in a WikiLeaks anniversary meeting in Berlin with Assange teleconferencing from his refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, reporters spoke of a supposed promise to reveal further information against Clinton which would bring her candidacy down, calling this information \"The October Surprise\".[189] On 7 October, Assange posted a press release on WikiLeaks exposing a second batch of emails with over 2,000 mails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.[190] Cybersecurity experts and firms attributed the cyberattack to the Russian government.[19] The Central Intelligence Agency together with several other agencies concluded in a leaked secret report, that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the DNC servers, as well as the email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and leaked the stolen information to WikiLeaks to bolster Trump's chances of winning the presidency.[191] As result of the Special Counsel investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections 12 Russian military intelligence agents were indicted on 13 July 2018 for being behind the attack on the DNC mail-server. According to the special counsel's findings this group shared these mails using the pseudonym Guccifer 2.0 with other entities including Wikileaks.[192] The investigation also unearthed direct message exchanges between Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks, in which they coordinated the release of the shared material.[193] In interviews, Assange repeatedly denied that the Russian government was the source of the DNC and Podesta emails,[194][195][21] and accused the Clinton campaign of \"a kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria.\"[20] On the eve of the general presidential election, Assange wrote a press release addressing the criticism around publishing Clinton material on WikiLeaks, saying that WikiLeaks publishes \"material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere,\" that it had never received any information on Trump, Jill Stein, or Gary Johnson's campaign, and that therefore could not publish what it did not have.[196][197] According to Harvard political scientist Matthew Baum and College of the Canyons political scientist Phil Gussin, WikiLeaks strategically released emails related to the Clinton campaign whenever Clinton's lead expanded in the polls.[198] Assange was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Democratic National Committee in April 2018. The lawsuit alleged that WikiLeaks and Russian agents together engaged in a \"brazen attack on American democracy\" about the hacking and publication of its emails in 2016.[199] WikiLeaks sought to dismiss the suit, with its editor in chief Kristinn Hrafnsson calling the case \"a litmus test for press freedoms. The suit claimed that the scandalous emails of powerful political operatives are 'trade secrets' and cannot be published.\"[200] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that the lawsuit \"raises several important press freedom questions\" including the determination of what activities should \"implicate a journalist in a source's illegal behaviour.\"[201] The organisation cited several First Amendment experts who opined that the lawsuit, if successful, might undermine the Supreme Court's precedents that publishers of information \"are not responsible for the illegal acts of their sources,\" such as Bartnicki v. Vopper.[201] The suit was dismissed with prejudice in July 2019. In his judgement, Judge John Koeltl said that the defendants including Assange and Wikileaks \"did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place\" and were therefore within the law in publishing the information. He also said that the DNC case was \"entirely divorced\" from the facts. The suit could not be refiled due to its \"substantive legal defect\".[202] In September 2017, Assange released \"Spy Files Russia,\" revealing \"how a St. Petersburg-based technology company called Peter-Service helped Russian state entities gather detailed data on Russian cellphone users, part of a national system of online surveillance called System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM).\" According to Moscow based journalist Fred Weir, \"experts say it casts a timely spotlight on the vast surveillance operations mounted by Russian security services.\"[203] The unexpected release of the material during the height of the Special Counsel investigation into the relationship between Wikileaks and Russia has drawn some criticism for not revealing anything groundbreaking and therefore looking more like an \"approved release direct from the Russian government\" as an attempt to detract from the investigation.[204][205] After WikiLeaks released the Manning material, United States authorities began investigating WikiLeaks and Assange personally to prosecute them under the Espionage Act of 1917.[206] In November 2010 US Attorney-General Eric Holder said there was \"an active, ongoing criminal investigation\" into WikiLeaks.[207] It emerged from legal documents leaked over the ensuing months that Assange and others were being investigated by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia.[208] In December 2011, prosecutors in the Chelsea Manning case revealed the existence of chat logs between Manning and an alleged WikiLeaks interlocutor they claimed to be Assange;[209][210] he denied this,[211][212][213] dismissing the alleged connection as \"absolute nonsense\".[214] The logs were presented as evidence during Manning's court-martial in June\u2013July 2013.[215] The prosecution argued that they showed WikiLeaks helping Manning reverse-engineer a password, but the evidence that the interlocutor was Assange was circumstantial, and Manning insisted she acted alone.[216] In 2013 US officials said that it was unlikely that the Justice Department would indict Assange for publishing classified documents because \"it would also have to prosecute the New York Times and other news organizations and writers who published classified material, including The Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper\".[217] Assange was being examined separately by \"several government agencies\" in addition to the grand jury, most notably the FBI.[218] Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that Assange was under \"active and ongoing\" investigation at that time.[219] Moreover, some Snowden documents published in 2014 show that the United States government put Assange on the \"2010 Manhunting Timeline\",[220] and in the same period they urged their allies to open criminal investigations into the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks.[221] In the same documents there was a proposal by the National Security Agency (NSA) to designate WikiLeaks as a \"malicious foreign actor\", thus increasing the surveillance against it.[220] In January 2015, WikiLeaks issued a statement saying that three members of the organisation had received notice from Google that Google had complied with a federal warrant by a US District Court to turn over their emails and metadata on 5 April 2012.[222] In July 2015 he called himself a \"wanted journalist\" in Le Monde, in an open letter to the French president.[48] In a December 2015 court submission, the US government confirmed its \"sensitive, ongoing law enforcement proceeding into the Wikileaks matter.\"[223] Under the Obama Administration the Department of Justice did not indict Assange because it was unable to find any evidence that his actions differed from those of a journalist.[224] When Mike Pompeo became CIA director, he and Jeff Sessions \"unleashed an aggressive campaign against Mr. Assange, reversing an Obama-era view of WikiLeaks as a journalistic entity\".[225] In April 2017, US officials were preparing to file formal charges against Assange.[226] In early 2019, individuals began to come forward with news of being questioned about Assange by prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia. Legal scholar Stephen Vladeck stated that the prosecutors, after refusing to unseal the indictment, accelerated the case in 2019 due to the impending statute of limitations on Assange's largest leaks.[227] Witnesses named in the investigation included Jacob Appelbaum, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, David House, Jason Katz and Chelsea Manning, all of whom condemned it as a form of government over-reach.[228] Assange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women.[10] He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was reopened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \"lesser-degree rape\" (Swedish: mindre grov v\u00e5ldt\u00e4kt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain.[11][229] On 20 November 2010, the Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant via Interpol for Assange. On 8 December 2010 Assange gave himself up to British police and attended his first extradition hearing where he was remanded in custody pending another hearing. On 16 December 2010 at the second hearing, he was granted bail by the High Court and released after his supporters paid \u00a3240,000 in cash and sureties. A further hearing on 24 February 2011 ruled that Assange should be extradited to Sweden. This decision was upheld by the High Court on 2 November and by the Supreme Court on 30 May the next year.[230] After previously stating that she could not question a suspect by video link or in the Swedish embassy, prosecutor Marianne Ny wrote to the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2013. Her letter advised that she intended to lift the detention order and withdraw the European arrest warrant as the actions were not proportionate to the costs and seriousness of the crime. In response the CPS tried to dissuade Ny from doing so.[231] In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, Ny changed her mind about interrogating Assange, who had taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[232] These interviews, which began on 14 November 2016, involved the police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials, and were eventually published online.[233] By that time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \"lesser degree rape\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020.[234][235][236][237] On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities suspended their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\", she said.[238][239][240] Following Assange's arrest on 11 April 2019, the case was reopened under prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson. In September 2019, she revealed that she had interviewed seven witnesses, two of whom had not been previously heard, but had yet to determine how to proceed in the case.[241] On 19 November, she announced that she had discontinued her investigation into Assange, stating that after a comprehensive assessment, \"the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment\". She added that although she was confident in the complainant, \"the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed\". Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson welcomed the decision.[242] On 19 June 2012, the Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, announced that Assange had applied for political asylum, that his government was considering the request, and that Assange was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[243][244][245][246] Assange breached bail conditions by staying in the embassy and faced arrest if he left. Assange's supporters, including journalist Jemima Goldsmith, journalist John Pilger, and film-maker Ken Loach, forfeited \u00a3293,500 in bail and sureties.[247][248] Goldsmith said she was surprised at his asylum bid and expected him to face the Swedish allegations.[249] Just before Assange was granted asylum, the UK government wrote to Pati\u00f1o stating that the police were entitled to enter the embassy and arrest Assange under UK law.[250] Pati\u00f1o criticised what he said was an implied threat, stating that \"such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna Convention\". Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service were stationed outside the building from June 2012 to October 2015 to arrest Assange for breaching the bail conditions and to compel him to attend court to face the extradition appeal hearing, should he leave the embassy. The police guard was withdrawn on grounds of cost in October 2015, but the police said they would still deploy \"several overt and covert tactics to arrest him\". The cost of the policing for the period was reported to have been \u00a312.6\u00a0 million.[251] Wikileaks insiders stated that Assange decided to seek asylum because he felt abandoned by the Australian government. The Australian attorney-general at the time, Nicola Roxon, had written a letter to Assange's legal representative, Jennifer Robinson, in which she wrote that Australia would not seek to involve itself in any international exchanges about Assange's future. She also wrote that \"should Mr Assange be convicted of any offence in the United States and a sentence of imprisonment imposed, he may apply for an international prisoner transfer to Australia\". Assange's lawyers described the letter as a \"declaration of abandonment\".[252] Assange and his supporters said he was not concerned about any proceedings in Sweden as such, but believed that his deportation to Sweden could lead to politically motivated deportation to the United States, where he could face severe penalties, up to the death sentence, for his activities related to WikiLeaks.[7] On 16 August 2012, Pati\u00f1o announced that Ecuador was granting Assange political asylum because of the threat represented by the United States secret investigation against him.[253][254][255][256] In its formal statement, Ecuador reasoned that \"as a consequence of Assange's determined defense to freedom of expression and freedom of press\u2026 in any given moment, a situation may come where his life, safety or personal integrity will be in danger\".[257] Latin American states expressed support for Ecuador.[258][259][260][261] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa confirmed on 18 August that Assange could stay at the embassy indefinitely,[262][263][264] and the following day Assange gave his first speech from the balcony.[265][266][267][268] An office converted into a studio apartment, equipped with a bed, telephone, sun lamp, computer, shower, treadmill, and kitchenette, became his home from then until 11 April 2019.[269][270][271] In April 2015, during a video conference to promote the documentary Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, Mar\u00eda Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013 after France, Spain and Italy denied access to their airspace. \"It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences\", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan \"was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result was caused by the United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened.\"[272] In an interview the following month with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, but Assange stated that \"the code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet\u00a0... and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn't think much more of it.\u00a0... We didn't think this was anything more than just distracting.\" Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.[273] On 3 July 2015, Paris newspaper Le Monde published an open letter from Assange to French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in which Assange urged the French government to grant him refugee status.[48] In response to this letter, the French President said: \"France cannot act on his request. The situation of Mr Assange does not present an immediate danger.\"[274] On 4 July 2015, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, head of Assange's legal team, said that Assange had sent the open letter to French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande; but Assange had only expressed his willingness \"to be hosted in France if and only if an initiative was taken by the competent authorities\".[275] In September 2016, Assange said he would agree to US prison in exchange for President Obama granting Chelsea Manning clemency.[276][277] Obama commuted Manning's sentence on 17 January 2017.[277] The next day, at his final presidential news conference, Obama stated, \"I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance.\"[278] The same day, Assange's US-based attorney Barry Pollack asserted (without saying when or where) that Assange \"had called for Chelsea Manning to receive clemency and be released immediately\". Accordingly, Pollack maintained, the commutation\u2014which specified Manning would be freed four months thence\u2014did not meet Assange's conditions.[279] On 17 May 2017, Manning was released from prison.[280] Two days later, Assange emerged on the embassy's balcony and told a crowd that, despite no longer facing a Swedish sex investigation, he would remain inside the embassy to avoid extradition to the United States.[281] On 17 October 2016, WikiLeaks announced that a \"state party\" had severed Assange's Internet connection at the Ecuadorian embassy.[282] The Ecuadorian government stated that it had \"temporarily\" severed Assange's Internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents \"impacting on the US election campaign\".[283] In an interview published on 29 December, Assange said, \"The Internet has been returned.\"[284] On 15 July 2019, CNN obtained documents from an Ecuadorian intelligence official which confirmed that Assange continued to publish Wikileaks material while in the Ecuadorian embassy.[285] The documents also revealed that during the 2016 election in the United States, Assange met with dozens of people within the Ecuadorian embassy. These included employees from RT, for which Assange regularly produced media content, and two German hackers.[285] On 6 June 2017, Assange tweeted his support for NSA leaker Reality Winner,[286] offering a $10,000 reward for information about a reporter for The Intercept who had allegedly helped the US government to identify Winner as the leaker.[287] Assange posted on Twitter: \"Reality Leight [sic] Winner is no Clapper or Petraeus with 'elite immunity'. She's a young woman against the wall for talking to the press.\"[288] Special counsel Robert Mueller's team had been investigating a meeting between former Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort and President Len\u00edn Moreno in Quito in 2017. Moreno talked with Manafort about removing Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and his extradition to the United States.[289] On 28 March 2018, Ecuador cut Assange's Internet connection at its London embassy \"to prevent any potential harm\". Officials said that Assange's recent social media posts denouncing the arrest of Catalonian separatist leader Carles Puigdemont \"put at risk\" Ecuador's relations with European nations. Assange then went silent on social media.[290] In May 2018, a team of Guardian journalists, including Luke Harding, reported that over a five-year span Ecuador had spent at least $5\u00a0million (\u00a33.7m) through a secret intelligence budget to protect Assange at its London embassy, \"employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police\". Visitors included \"individuals linked to the Kremlin\". Ecuadorian officials had reportedly also devised plans to help Assange escape should British authorities use force to enter the embassy and seize him. The Guardian also reported that documents and \"a source who wished to remain anonymous\" had indicated that, by 2014, Assange had \"compromised\" the embassy's communications system and arranged his satellite Internet hookup. \"By penetrating the embassy's firewall\", Assange was allegedly able to \"access and intercept the official and personal communications of staff\". According to The Guardian, this claim was denied by WikiLeaks as an \"anonymous libel aligned with the current UK\u2013US government onslaught against Mr Assange\".[291] On 21 July 2018, Glenn Greenwald reported that the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry was finalising an agreement to release Assange into the custody of the British government.[292] In a press conference the following week, President Len\u00edn Moreno confirmed that he wanted Assange out of the embassy but also \"for his life not to be in danger\".[293] This prompted wide speculation that Moreno aimed to strengthen Ecuador's relations with the United States and assist their extradition efforts.[294] In September 2018, Reuters reported that Ecuador had, in December 2017, granted Assange a \"special designation\" diplomatic post in Russia \u2013 and the cover to leave the embassy and England \u2013 but the British Foreign Office did not recognise diplomatic immunity for Assange and the effort was dropped.[295][296] On 14 October 2018, ITV News reported that Assange's communications had been partially restored following a meeting between two senior UN officials and Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno.[297] On 16 October 2018, congressmen from the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote an open letter to President Moreno which described Assange as a dangerous criminal and stated that progress between the US and Ecuador in the areas of economic co-operation, counternarcotics assistance and the return of a USAID mission to Ecuador depended on Assange being \"handed over to the proper authorities\".[298][299] On 19 October 2018, BBC News reported that Assange was starting legal action against the government of Ecuador, accusing it of violating his \"fundamental rights and freedoms\".[300] Later that month, an Ecuadorian judge ruled against him, saying that a requirement for Assange to pay for his Internet use and clean up after his cat did not violate his right to asylum.[301] In November 2018, Pamela Anderson, a close friend and regular visitor of Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy, gave an interview with 60 Minutes in Australia in which she asked the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to \"defend your friend, and get Julian his passport back, and take him back to Australia and be proud of him\".[302] Morrison rejected the request but his response was described as \"smutty\" and \"lewd\" by Anderson who wrote in an open letter to Morrison that \"[y]ou trivialised and laughed about the suffering of an Australian and his family. You followed it with smutty, unnecessary comments about a woman voicing her political opinion.\" She further advised Morrison that \"[r]ather than making lewd suggestions about me, perhaps you should instead think about what you are going to say to millions of Australians when one of their own is marched in an orange jumpsuit to Guantanamo Bay \u2013 for publishing the truth. You can prevent this.\"[303] In December 2018, President Moreno reached an agreement to have Assange leave the embassy in what he called \"near liberty\". According to a radio interview by Moreno, British sources told him that Assange would be free to live in the United Kingdom without extradition after serving a prison sentence of at most six months. The formal offer was less explicit, simply stating that he would not be extradited to a country with the death penalty. Assange's lawyers declined, citing a need for further protection.[304] In February 2019, the parliament of Geneva passed a motion demanding that the Swiss government extend asylum to Assange. The move was proposed by the Swiss People's Party and supported by the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland.[305] In the same month, it was revealed that Assange was issued with a new Australian passport in September 2018. His previous passport had expired several years ago.[306] In 2015, la Repubblica lodged Freedom of Information requests in Australia, England, the United States and Sweden, seeking information about Assange. It said it was trying to discover whether US authorities told their UK counterparts in 2010 that they\u00a0intended to extradite Assange and also whether the Swedish investigation was used as a way of trying to extradite him to the US. la Repubblica said that its FOI requests had been hindered and delayed in all jurisdictions. However it said it was able to obtain evidence of the UK's role via the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in creating the \"legal and diplomatic quagmire\" which prevented Assange from leaving the Ecuadorian embassy. la Repubblica sued the CPS in 2017 to obtain further information but its case was rejected with the judge saying \"the need\u00a0for the British authorities\u00a0to protect the confidentiality of\u00a0the extradition process\u00a0outweighs\u00a0the public interest of the press to know\".[307] A further appeal was rejected in September 2019.[307][308] The Ecuadorian government of Rafael Correa requested an advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the issue of \"the Institution of Asylum and its Recognition as a Human Right in the Inter-American System,\" and the court issued its advisory opinion in May 2018, upholding the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits signatories of the American Convention on Human Rights from deporting foreign individuals when such a deportation would likely lead to their persecution.[309] According to Doughty Street, the ruling was made shortly after US Vice-President Mike Pence raised the issue of Ecuador's grant of asylum to Assange while on a visit to Ecuador.[310] On 5 February 2016, the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Assange had been subject to arbitrary detention by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison, on conditional bail and in the Ecuadorian embassy. According to the group, Assange should be allowed to walk free and be given compensation.[311][312] The UK and Swedish governments rejected the claim.[313] UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Hammond, said the claim was \"ridiculous\" and that the group was \"made up of lay people\", and called Assange a \"fugitive from justice\" who \"can come out any time he chooses\".[314] UK and Swedish prosecutors called the group's claims irrelevant.[315][316] The UK said it would arrest Assange should he leave the Ecuadorian embassy.[317] Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association, stated that the finding is \"not binding on British law\".[318] Noah Feldman, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, described the UN Working Group's conclusion as astonishing, summarising the conclusion as \"Assange might be charged with a crime in the US. Ecuador thinks charging him with violating national security law would amount to \"political persecution\" or worse. Therefore Sweden must give up on its claims to try him for rape, and Britain must ignore the Swedes' arrest warrant and let him leave the country.\"[319] The Working Group again urged the UK to let Assange leave the Ecuador embassy in London freely. In a statement on 21 December 2018, the organisation asserted that the \"Swedish investigations have been closed for over 18 months now, and the only ground remaining for Mr Assange's continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK, which is, objectively, a minor offence that cannot post-facto justify the more than six years' confinement that he has been subjected to\".[320] In 2019, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights rejected a complaint submitted by Assange, requesting that the Ecuadorian government \"ease the conditions it has imposed on his residence\" at the Ecuadorian embassy in London by monitoring him and restricting his visitors, and not allow him to be extradited to the United States.[321] In 2019, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Prof. Nils Melzer stated that Assange had been subjected to mental torture [322] and demanded his release. He has repeatedly warned about Assange's deteriorating state of health. [323] In April, Ecuador's president Lenin Moreno stated that Assange had violated the terms of his asylum, after photos surfaced on the internet linking Moreno to a corruption scandal.[324][325] WikiLeaks denied that it had acquired any of the published material, and stated that it merely reported on a corruption investigation against Moreno by Ecuador's legislature.[325] WikiLeaks subsequently wrote on Twitter that according to a source within the Ecuadorian government, an agreement had been reached to expel Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy and place him in the custody of UK police.[326][327] The source stated that the expulsion from the embassy would occur in retaliation against WikiLeaks' tweet noting corruption charges against Moreno.[326] Ecuador's Foreign Ministry denied the existence of any planned expulsion.[326][327] On 11 April 2019, the Metropolitan Police were invited into the Ecuadorian embassy and arrested Assange in connection with his failure to surrender to the court in June 2012 for extradition to Sweden.[328] Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno stated that Ecuador withdrew Assange's asylum after he repeatedly violated international conventions regarding domestic interference.[329][330] Moreno referred to Assange as a \"spoiled brat\" and \"miserable hacker\".[331] British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the Ecuadorean president, Lenin Moreno, for co-operation and the British prime minister, Theresa May, said that \"no one is above the law\".[332] The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that Assange is \"not going to be given special treatment\u00a0... It has got nothing to do with [Australia], it is a matter for the US.\"[333] Hours after Assange's arrest, programmer Ola Bini was arrested (but not charged) in Ecuador and interrogated about an alleged plot by unnamed Russian hackers to release compromising information about Moreno in retaliation. Bini had previously met with Assange at the embassy, posted a link to a news article about the plot to Twitter,[334] describing it as a \"witch hunt\", before leaving on a trip to Japan.[335] On the afternoon of the day of his arrest Assange was charged with breaching the Bail Act 1976 and was found guilty after a short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.[336] Judge Michael Snow said Assange was \"a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest\" and he had \"not come close to establishing reasonable excuse\".[337] Assange was remanded to HM Prison Belmarsh, and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court to 50 weeks imprisonment.[23] The judge said he would be released after serving half his sentence, subject to other proceedings and conditioned upon committing no further offences.[338] The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued a statement through the website of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights that the verdict contravened \"principles of necessity and proportionality\" for what it considered a \"minor violation\".[339][340] Assange appealed his sentence, but dropped his appeal in July.[341] On 10 April 2019, WikiLeaks said it had uncovered an extensive surveillance operation against Assange from within the Ecuadorian embassy, asserting that videotapes of Assange taken at the embassy constituted an invasion of privacy. WikiLeaks said that \"material including video, audio, copies of private legal documents and a medical report\" had surfaced in Spain and that unnamed individuals in Madrid had made an extortion attempt.[342][343] On 26 September 2019 the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that the Spanish defence and security company Undercover Global S.L. (UC Global) had spied on Assange for the CIA during his time in the Ecuadorian embassy. UC Global had been contracted to protect the embassy during this time. According to the report UC Global's owner David Morales had provided the CIA with audio and video of meetings Assange held with his lawyers and colleagues. Morales also arranged for the US to have direct access to the stream from video cameras installed in the embassy at the beginning of December 2017. The evidence is part of a secret investigation by Spain's High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, into Morales and his relationship with US intelligence. The investigation was precipitated by a complaint by Assange that accused UC Global of violating his privacy and client-attorney privileges as well as committing misappropriation, bribery and money laundering.[344] Morales was arrested in September on charges involving violations of privacy and client-attorney privileges, as well as misappropriation, bribery, money laundering and criminal possession of weapons. He was released on bail. On 25 September, Spanish Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata sent British authorities a European Investigation Order (EIO) asking for permission to question Assange by videoconference as a witness in the case against Morales. The United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA), which is in charge of processing and responding to EIOs in the UK, provisionally denied De la Mata's request to question Assange, raised a number of objections to the request, and asked for more details. De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK. He said that the crimes were partially committed on Spanish territory because the microphones used to spy on Assange were bought in Spain, and the information obtained was sent and uploaded to servers at UC Global S. L.'s headquarters in Spain.[345] Spanish judicial bodies were upset at having their EIO request denied by UKCA and believed the British justice system is concerned by the effect the Spanish case may have on the process to extradite Assange to the US.[345] In a November 2019 article Stefania Maurizi said she had access to some of the videos, audios and photos from the embassy showing a medical examination of Assange, a meeting between Ecuadorian ambassador Carlos Abad Ortiz and his staff, a meeting between Assange, Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda and lunch between Assange and British rapper M.I.A. Microphones had been placed in the women's toilets to capture meetings between Assange and his lawyers. Phones belonging to some of the embassy's visitors were compromised. Spanish lawyer Aitor Martinez, who is part of Assange's legal team, said videos were taken of meetings between Assange and his legal defence team. Maurizi concluded that, based on statements from former employees of UC Global, internal UC Global emails and the type of information collected, it was clear that the surveillance was conducted on behalf of the US government and the information gathered would be used by the US to assist in its case for extraditing Assange.[346] In late November 2019 Britain agreed to allow Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata to interview Assange at Westminster Magistrates Court via video link on 20 December.[347] According to his lawyer, Assange testified that he was unaware that cameras installed by Undercover Global were also capturing audio and suggested the surveillance likely targeted his legal team.[348] In 2012 and 2013, US officials indicated that Assange was not named in a sealed indictment.[349][350] On 6 March 2018, a federal grand jury for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a sealed indictment against Assange.[351] In November 2018, US prosecutors accidentally revealed that Assange had been indicted under seal in US federal court; the revelation came as a result of an error in a different court filing, unrelated to Assange.[352][353][354][355][356] On 11 April 2019, the day of Assange's arrest in London, the indictment against him was unsealed.[357] He was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion (i.e. hacking into a government computer), a relatively minor crime that carries a maximum 5-year sentence if found guilty.[358][359] The charges stem from the allegation that Assange attempted and failed to crack a password hash so that Chelsea Manning could use a different username to download classified documents and avoid detection.[224] This information had been known since 2011 and was a component of Manning's trial; the indictment did not reveal any new information about Assange.[224][360] On 23 May, Assange was indicted on 17 new charges relating to the Espionage Act of 1917 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.[361] The Espionage Act charges carry a maximum sentence of 170 years in prison.[362] The Obama administration had debated charging Assange under the Espionage Act but decided against it out of fear that it would have a negative effect on investigative journalism and could be unconstitutional. The new charges relate to obtaining and publishing the secret documents. Most of these charges relate to obtaining the secret documents. The three charges related to publication concern documents which revealed the names of sources in dangerous places putting them \"at a grave and imminent risk\" of harm or detention. The New York Times commented that it and other news organisations obtained the same documents as WikiLeaks also without government authorisation. It also said it is not clear how WikiLeaks's publications are legally different from other publications of classified information.[363][364] Most cases brought under the Espionage Act have been against government employees who accessed sensitive information and leaked it to journalists and others.[365] Prosecuting people for acts related to receiving and publishing information has not previously been tested in court.[363] In 1975, the Justice Department decided after consideration not to charge journalist Seymour Hersh for reporting on US surveillance of the Soviet Union.[365] Two lobbyists for a pro-Israel group were charged in 2005 with receiving and sharing classified information about American policy toward Iran. The charges however did not relate to the publication of the documents and the case was dropped by the Justice Department in 2009 prior to judgement.[363][365] Assistant Attorney General John Demers said \"Julian Assange is no journalist\".[366] The US allegation that Assange's publication of these secrets was illegal was deemed controversial by Australia's Seven News as well as CNN.[364][367] The Cato Institute also questioned the US government's position which attempts to position Assange as not a journalist.[368] The Associated Press said Assange's indictment presented media freedom issues, as Assange's solicitation and publication of classified information is a routine job journalists perform.[369] Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, stated that what Assange is accused of doing is factually different from but legally similar to what professional journalists do.[370] Vladeck also said the Espionage Act charges could provide Assange with an argument against extradition under the US-UK treaty as there is an exemption in the treaty for political offences.[364] Forbes magazine stated that the US government created outcry among journalists in its indictment of Assange as the US sought to debate if Assange was a journalist or not.[371] Suzanne Nossel of PEN America said it was immaterial if Assange was a journalist or publisher and pointed instead to first amendment concerns.[372] Several jurists, politicians, associations, academics and campaigners consider that the arrest of Assange constitutes an attack on freedom of the press and international law.[373][374][375] The Reporters Without Borders said Assange's arrest could \"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistle-blowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future.\"[376] Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, wrote that Assange's prosecution for publishing leaked documents is \"a major threat to global media freedom\".[377] Independent United Nations rights experts such as Agnes Callamard said \"the arrest of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange by police in the United Kingdom, after the Ecuadorian Government decided to stop granting him asylum in their London embassy, exposed him to the risk of serious human rights violations, if extradited to the United States\".[378] WikiLeaks was recognised as a \"media organisation\" in 2017 by a UK tribunal, contradicting public assertions to the contrary by some US officials, and possibly supporting Assange's efforts to oppose his extradition to the United States.[379][380][381][382] This is why the Dutch senator Tiny Kox asked the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatovic, whether the arrest of Assange and his possible extradition to the US are in line with the criteria of the European Convention on Human Rights, because Assange can benefit from the protection of the right to freedom of expression and information according the Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.[383] British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed \"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and his extradition to the United States \"should be opposed by the British government\".[376] Eva Joly, magistrate and MEP, said that \"the arrest of Julian Assange is an attack on freedom of expression, international law and right to asylum\".[384] Sevim Dagdelen, a German Bundestag MP who specialises in international law and press law, describes Assange's arrest as \"an attack on independent journalism\" and says that he \"is today seriously endangered\".[385][386] Dick Marty, a former state prosecutor of Ticino and rapporteur on the CIA's secret prisons for the Council of Europe, considers the arrest of whistleblowers \"very shocking\".[387][388] Several well-known Swiss jurists have asked the Federal Council to grant asylum to the founder of Wikileaks because he is threatened with extradition to the United States, which in the past \"silenced whistleblowers\".[389][390] The French Union of Journalists (Syndicat national des journalistes (CGT)\u00a0[fr]), said that \"the dissemination of documents or information of public interest\" could not be considered a legal offence. The union called on Britain \"to refuse the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States and to release him.\"[391] In a letter, several French Union of Journalists (Syndicat national des journalistes (CGT)\u00a0[fr]) and (Syndicat national des journalistes (CFDT)\u00a0[fr]) ask to Emmanuel Macron to enforce Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights . According them, \"Faced with threats to Julian Assange's health and at the risk of seeing him sentenced to life imprisonment, we are saying loud and clear, with the IFJ (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale des journalistes) that \"journalism is not a crime\". They add \"Julian Assange denounced in his publications war crimes condemned by the Geneva Convention. Today, he is the one we would like to imprison, we would like to silence. ..... We consider this case one of the most serious attacks on the freedom of the press, against public freedoms within the EU. The IFJ, the French unions and their Australian counterparts have launched a motion to seize this serious case the UN Human Rights Council and the European Parliament and the Council of Europe\".[392] The yellow vests movement called for Assange's release.[393][394][395] While some US politicians supported the arrest and indictment of Julian Assange, several non-governmental organisations of press freedom condemned it. Mark Warner, vice-chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, welcomed the arrest of Assange, saying that Assange was \"a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security\".[396] The president of the Center for American Progress and former Obama aide Neera Tanden also welcomed the arrest and condemned Assange's leftist supporters, tweeting that \"the Assange cultists are the worst. Assange was the agent of a proto-fascist state, Russia, to undermine democracy. That is fascist behaviour. Anyone on the left should abhor what he did.\"[396] The deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Robert Mahoney, said \"With this prosecution of Julian Assange, the US government could set out broad legal arguments about journalists soliciting information or interacting with sources that could have chilling consequences for investigative reporting and the publication of information of public interest.[375] According Yochai Benkler, a Harvard law professor, the charge sheet contained some \"very dangerous elements that pose significant risk to national security reporting. Sections of the indictment are vastly overbroad and could have a significant chilling effect \u2013 they ought to be rejected.\"[375] Carrie DeCell, staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the charges \"risk having a chill on journalism\".[375] She added,\"Many of the allegations fall absolutely within the first amendment's protections of journalistic activity. That's very troubling to us.\"[375] Ben Wizner from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) speculated that if authorities were to prosecute Assange \"for violating US secrecy laws [it] would set an especially dangerous precedent for US journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\"[397][398][397][398] NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg condemned the indictment.[399][400] Snowden tweeted that \"Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom.\"[401] Daniel Ellsberg said \"Forty-eight years ago, I was the first journalistic source to be indicted. There have been perhaps a dozen since then, nine under President Obama. But Julian Assange is the first journalist to be indicted. If he is extradited to the U.S. and convicted, he will not be the last. The First Amendment is a pillar of our democracy and this is an assault on it. If freedom of speech is violated to this extent, our republic is in danger. Unauthorized disclosures are the lifeblood of the republic.\"[402][403] According to Ron Paul, Assange should receive the same kind of protections as the mainstream media when it comes to releasing information. He said \"In a free society we're supposed to know the truth\u00a0 ... In a society where truth becomes treason, then we're in big trouble. And now, people who are revealing the truth are getting into trouble for it.\" He added \"This is media, isn't it? I mean, why don't we prosecute The New York Times or anybody that releases this?\"[404] In October 2019 former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce called for the Federal Government to take action to stop Assange being extradited from the United Kingdom to the US. Later in October, the cross-party \"Bring Assange Home Parliamentary Working Group\" was established. Its co-chairs are independent MP Andrew Wilkie and North Queensland politician George Christensen. Its members include Greens Richard Di Natale, Adam Bandt and Peter Whish-Wilson, Centre Alliance MPs Rebekha Sharkie and Rex Patrick and independent MP Zali Steggall. The working group will request to visit Assange to determine what support they can provide.[405] Former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa condemned Assange's arrest.[406] Bolivian President Evo Morales also condemned it.[332] Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the indictment.[407][332] In January 2020, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted to oppose Assange\u2019s extradition to the US.[408] Since his arrest at the embassy, Assange has been incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh in London.[23] After examining Assange on 9 May 2019, United Nations special rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Nils Melzer concluded, \"in addition to physical ailments, Mr Assange showed all symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma.\"[409] The British government said it supported the important work of the rapporteur's mandate but disagreed with some of his observations.[410] In a later interview Melzer criticised the \"secretive grand jury indictment in the United States\", the \"abusive manner in which Swedish prosecutors disseminated, re-cycled and perpetuated their 'preliminary investigation' into alleged sexual offences\", the \"termination by Ecuador of Mr Assange's asylum status and citizenship without any form of due process\", and the \"overt bias against Mr Assange being shown by British judges since his arrest\". He said the United States, UK, Sweden and Ecuador were trying to make an example of Assange. He also accused journalists of \"spreading abusive and deliberately distorted narratives\".[411] Shortly after Melzer's visit, Assange was transferred to the prison's health care unit.[412] On 13 September, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that Assange would not be released on 22 September when his prison term ended, because he was a flight risk and his lawyer had not applied for bail.[413] She said when his sentence came to an end, his status would change from a serving prisoner to a person facing extradition.[413] On 1 November 2019, Melzer said Assange's health had continued to deteriorate and his life was now at risk.[414][412] He said that the UK government had not acted on the issue.\"[414][412] In November 2019, an open letter signed by more than 60 doctors said Assange's health was declining to an extent that he could die in prison.[415] On 30 December 2019, Melzer accused the UK government of torturing Julian Assange. He said Assange's \"continued exposure to severe mental and emotional suffering ... clearly amounts to psychological torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"[416][417] On 2 May 2019, the first hearing was held in London into the United States request for Assange's extradition. When asked by the judge whether he consented to the extradition, Assange replied \"I do not wish to surrender myself for extradition for doing journalism that has won many, many awards and protected many people\".[418] On 13 June, British Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he had signed the US extradition order.[419] On 14 June, a procedural hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court decided that a full extradition hearing should begin in February 2020.[420] On 21 October 2019, Assange appeared at the court for a case management hearing. Judge Vanessa Baraitser denied Assange's defence lawyers' request for a three-month delay so that they could gather evidence. Government prosecutor James Lewis QC and the US opposed any delay.[421][422][423] When the judge asked about his understanding of the proceedings Assange replied: \"I don't understand how this is equitable. This superpower had 10 years to prepare for this case and I can't access my writings. It's very difficult where I am to do anything but these people have unlimited resources. They are saying journalists and whistleblowers are enemies of the people. They have unfair advantages dealing with documents. They [know] the interior of my life with my psychologist. They steal my children's DNA. This is not equitable what is happening here\".[421]In January 2020, both sides of the case asked for more time to prepare. The judge reluctantly agreed, scheduling one week of hearings from 24 February and another three weeks from 18 May.[424] Assange describes himself as an advocate of information transparency and market libertarianism.[425] He has written a few short pieces, including \"State and terrorist conspiracies\" (2006),[426] \"Conspiracy as governance\" (2006),[427] \"The hidden curse of Thomas Paine\" (2008),[428] \"What's new about WikiLeaks?\" (2011),[429] and the foreword to Cypherpunks (2012).[144] Cypherpunks is primarily a transcript of the World Tomorrow episode eight two-part interview between Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn, and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmermann. In the foreword, Assange said, \"the Internet, our greatest tool for emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen\".[144] He also contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997),[51] and received a co-writer credit for the Calle 13 song \"Multi_Viral\" (2013). Assange's book, When Google Met WikiLeaks, was published by OR Books on 18 September 2014.[430] The book recounts when Google CEO Eric Schmidt requested a meeting with Assange, while he was on bail in rural Norfolk, UK. Schmidt was accompanied by Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas; Lisa Shields, vice-president of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Scott Malcomson, the communications director for the International Crisis Group. Excerpts were published on the Newsweek website, while Assange participated in a Q&A event that was facilitated by the Reddit website and agreed to an interview with Vogue magazine.[431][432][433] In her 2017 documentary on Assange, Laura Poitras included a scene of him calling the Swedish sexual assault allegations a \"radical feminist conspiracy\"\u2014a comment which she says led them to part ways.[434] In 2011, Assange criticised a Private Eye article for portraying WikiLeaks contributor Israel Shamir as anti-Semitic. According to editor Ian Hislop, Assange called the article \"an obvious attempt to deprive [WikiLeaks] of Jewish support and donations\" and went on to point out that several journalists involved were Jewish. On 1 March 2011, Assange released a statement in which he said, \"Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase. In particular, 'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and word. It is serious and upsetting. We treasure our strong Jewish support and staff, just as we treasure the support from pan-Arab democracy activists and others who share our hope for a just world.\"[435][436]",

WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010),[6][7] the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.[8]\nIn November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange,[9] after questioning him months earlier about allegations of sexual assault.[10][11] Assange denied the allegations, and said they were just a pretext for him to be extradited from Sweden to the United States because of his role in publishing secret American documents.[12][13] Assange surrendered to UK police on 7 December 2010 but was released on bail within ten days. Having been unsuccessful in his challenge to the extradition proceedings, he breached his \u00a3340,000 bail[14] in June 2012 to seek asylum from Ecuador.[15] In August 2012, Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador due to fears of political persecution and possible extradition to the United States.[16] In January 2018, he was granted Ecuadorian citizenship; however it was suspended in April 2019.[1] Assange remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for almost seven years.[17]\nDuring the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by candidate Hillary Clinton from her private email server when she was Secretary of State.[18] The U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as a Special Counsel investigation, concluded that the Russian government carried out a hacking campaign as part of broader efforts of interference in the 2016 United States elections. In 2018, twelve Russian intelligence officers, mostly affiliated with the GRU, were indicted on criminal charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; the indictment charged the Russians with carrying out the computer hacking and working with WikiLeaks and other organisations to spread the stolen documents. Assange consistently denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia in relation to the leaks, and accused the Clinton campaign of stoking \"a neo-McCarthy hysteria\".[19][20][21]\nOn 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy, and he was arrested.[22] Later that day he was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison in the United Kingdom.[23] On the same day, the United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange for alleged computer intrusion, related to the leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Times criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act.[24][25] Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation in May 2019,[26] but in November closed it again, saying that the evidence had weakened over time.[27] Assange is incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh, reportedly in ill health.\nAssange was born Julian Paul Hawkins on 3 July 1971 in Townsville, Queensland,[28][29][30] to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951),[31] a visual artist,[32]:34 and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder.[33] The couple separated before their son was born.[33]\nWhen Julian was a year old, his mother married Brett Assange,[34][35][36] an actor with whom she ran a small theatre company and whom Julian regards as his father (choosing Assange as his surname).[37] Christine had a house in Nelly Bay on Magnetic Island, where they lived from time to time until it was destroyed by fire.[29]\nChristine and Brett Assange divorced about 1979. Christine then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, and they had a son before breaking up in 1982.[28][38][32]:37\u201338 Julian had a nomadic childhood, living in over 30[39][40] Australian towns and cities by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne.[34][41]\nAssange attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979\u20131983)[37] and Townsville State High School in Queensland[42] as well as being schooled at home.[35] He studied programming, mathematics and physics at Central Queensland University (1994)[43] and the University of Melbourne (2003\u20132006),[34][44] but did not complete a degree.[45]\nWhile in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa. In 1989 they had a son, Daniel, now a software designer.[34][45][46] The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child.[35] At this time, Julian's brown hair turned white.[28] Julian was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood.[47] Julian has other children; in an open letter to then-French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, he stated that his youngest child lives in France with his mother. He also said his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.[48]\nIn 90's Assange visited Russia and developed interest for Russian literature, mentioning Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak and Dostoyevski as his favorite authors, as well Soviet children cartoons.[49] Between 1996 and 1998, he started traveling worldwide, visiting Germany, Poland, Russia and China, meeting \"like-minded young people\", including Chaos Computer Club in Germany.[50]\nIn 1987, aged 16, Assange began hacking under the name Mendax[35][51] (Latin for \"liar\"[52]). He and two others\u2014known as \"Trax\" and \"Prime Suspect\"\u2014formed a hacking group they called \"the International Subversives\".[35] He is thought to have been involved in the WANK (Worms Against Nuclear Killers) hack at NASA in 1989, but he does not acknowledge this.[53][32]:42\nIn September 1991, Assange was discovered hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel, a Canadian multinational telecommunications corporation.[35] The Australian Federal Police tapped Assange's phone line (he was using a modem), raided his home at the end of October[54] and eventually charged him in 1994 with 31 counts of hacking and related crimes.[35] In December 1996, he pleaded guilty to 24 charges (the others were dropped) and was ordered to pay reparations of A$2,100 and released on a good behaviour bond.[53][55] The perceived absence of malicious or mercenary intent and his disrupted childhood were cited to justify his lenient penalty.[55][56][57][58]\nIn 1993, Assange gave technical advice to the Victoria Police Child Exploitation Unit that assisted in prosecutions.[59][60] In the same year, he was involved in starting one of the first public Internet service providers in Australia, Suburbia Public Access Network.[34][61] He began programming in 1994, authoring or co-authoring the TCP port scanner Strobe (1995),[62][63] patches to the open-source database PostgreSQL (1996),[64][65] the Usenet caching software NNTPCache (1996),[66] the Rubberhose deniable encryption system (1997)[67][68] (which reflected his growing interest in cryptography),[69] and Surfraw, a command-line interface for web-based search engines (2000).[70] During this period, he also moderated the AUCRYPTO forum,[69] ran Best of Security, a website \"giving advice on computer security\" that had 5,000 subscribers in 1996,[32]:45 and contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997), a book about Australian hackers, including the International Subversives.[51][71] In 1998, he co-founded the company Earthmen Technology.[58]\nAssange stated that he registered the domain leaks.org in 1999, but \"didn't do anything with it\".[58] He did publicise a patent granted to the National Security Agency in August 1999, for voice-data harvesting technology: \"This patent should worry people. Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived in the bowels of an unaccountable foreign spy agency.\"[69]\nAssange and others established WikiLeaks in 2006. Assange became a member of the organisation's advisory board[72] and described himself as the editor-in-chief.[73] From 2007 to 2010, Assange travelled continuously on WikiLeaks business, visiting Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.[35][40][74][75][76]\nWikiLeaks published internet censorship lists, leaks,[77] and classified media from anonymous sources, including revelations about drone strikes in Yemen, corruption across the Arab world,[78] extrajudicial executions by Kenyan police,[79] 2008 Tibetan unrest in China,[80] the \"Petrogate\" oil scandal in Peru.[81]\nWikiLeaks first came to international prominence in 2008,[82] when \"most of the US fourth estate\" filed an amicus curiae brief\u2014through the organisational efforts of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP)\u2014to defend Wikileaks against a DMCA request from the Swiss bank Julius Baer, which had initially been granted.[83]\nLater documents included leaked emails from the Turkish government published at the height of Erdo\u011fan's post-coup purges in Turkey in December 2016,[84][85] &amp; the collection of more than two million emails from Syrian political figures, government ministries and companies. Assange said of the Syria Files that \"it helps us not merely to criticise one group or another, but to understand their interests, actions and thoughts. It is only through understanding this conflict that we can hope to resolve it.\"[86]\nBy 2015, WikiLeaks had published more than ten million documents and associated analyses, and was described by Assange as \"a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents.\"[87]\nThe material WikiLeaks published between 2006 and 2009 attracted various degrees of international attention,[88] but after it began publishing documents supplied by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley), WikiLeaks became a household name. The Manning material included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010)[6] which showed United States soldiers fatally shooting 18 people from a helicopter in Iraq, including journalists Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh.[7] This material also included the Afghanistan War logs (July 2010),[89] the Iraq War logs (October 2010),[90] and the Guant\u00e1namo files (April 2011).[91]\nControversy surrounding WikiLeaks reached its greatest intensity after Assange published a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic cables,[92] known as the \"Cablegate\" files, in November 2010, initially working with established Western media organisations, and later with smaller regional media organisations, while also publishing the cables upon which their reporting was based.[93][94] The files showed United States espionage against United Nations and other world leaders,[95][96][97] revealed tensions between the U.S. and its allies, and exposed corruption in countries throughout the world as documented by U.S. diplomats, helping to spark the Arab Spring.[98][99] The Cablegate and Iraq and Afghan War releases impacted diplomacy and public opinion globally, with responses varying by region.[94]\nOpinions of Assange at this time were divided. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard described his activities as \"illegal\",[100] but the police said he had not broken Australian law.[101] United States Vice-President Joe Biden and others called him a \"terrorist\".[102][103][104][105][106] Some called for his assassination or execution.[107][108][109][110][111] Support for Assange came from Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva,[112] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa,[113] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,[114][115] British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (then a backbench MP),[116] Spanish Podemos party leader Pablo Iglesias,[117] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay,[118] and Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro.[119] He also garnered support from many leading activists and celebrities, including Tariq Ali,[120] John Perry Barlow,[121] Daniel Ellsberg,[122][123] Mary Kostakidis,[124] John Pilger,[125][126] Ai Weiwei,[127] Michael Moore,[128] Noam Chomsky,[127] Vaughan Smith,[129][130] and Oliver Stone.[131]\nThe year 2010 culminated with the Sam Adams Award, which Assange accepted in October,[132] and a string of distinctions in December\u2014the Le Monde readers' choice award for person of the year,[133][134] the Time readers' choice award for person of the year (he was also a runner-up in Time's overall person of the year award),[135][136] a deal for his autobiography worth at least US$1.3\u00a0million,[137][138][139] and selection by the Italian edition of Rolling Stone as \"rockstar of the year\".[140]\nIn 2011 the Walkley Foundation awarded WikiLeaks the Walkley Award for \"Most outstanding contribution to journalism\".[141] It commended WikiLeaks and Assange for their \"brave, determined and independent stand for freedom of speech and transparency that has empowered people all over the world\".\nAssange announced that he would run for the Australian Senate in March 2012 under the new WikiLeaks Party,[142][143] and Cypherpunks[144] was published in November. In 2012, Assange hosted a television show on RT, a network funded by the Russian government.[145] In the same year, he analysed the Kissinger cables held at the US National Archives and released them in searchable form.[146] On 15 September 2014, he appeared via remote video link on Kim Dotcom's Moment of Truth town hall meeting held in Auckland.[147]\nThe following February, he won the Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal for Peace with Justice, previously awarded to only three people\u2014Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, and Buddhist spiritual leader Daisaku Ikeda.[148] Two weeks later, he filed for the trademark \"Julian Assange\" in Europe, which was to be used for \"Public speaking services; news reporter services; journalism; publication of texts other than publicity texts; education services; entertainment services.\"[149][150][151] For several years a member of the Australian journalists' union and still an honorary member,[152][153][154] he was awarded the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in June,[155][156] having earlier won the Amnesty International UK Media Award (New Media) in 2009.[157]\nOn 25 November 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and internal documents that provided details on the US military operations in Yemen from 2009 to March 2015.[158][159] In a statement accompanying release of \"Yemen Files\", Assange said about the US involvement in the Yemen war: \"The war in Yemen has produced 3.15\u00a0million internally displaced persons. Although the United States government has provided most of the bombs and is deeply involved in the conduct of the war itself reportage on the war in English is conspicuously rare.\"[159]\nIn April 2017, then CIA director Mike Pompeo, in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, called WikiLeaks \"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia\".[160] Pompeo's accusation followed a series of \"damaging leaks\" of confidential documents, codenamed Vault 7, that included details on the CIA's hacking capabilities.[161] Assange accused the CIA of trying to \"subvert\" his First Amendment rights, saying that \"History shows the danger of allowing the CIA or any intelligence agency, whose very modus operandi includes misdirection and lying, to be the sole arbiter of what is true or what is prudent. Otherwise, every day might see a repeat of the many foolish CIA actions which have led to death, displacement, dictatorship and terrorism.\"[162]\nIn August 2017, in the midst of the Qatar diplomatic crisis, Saudi-owned newspaper Al Arabiya, based in Dubai, said that Assange \"has seven cables about Qatar and only five were published\" after Qatar negotiated with WikiLeaks. Assange responded that \"The Al Arabiya network (HQ in UAE) has been publishing increasingly absurd fabrications as the UAE v Qatar dispute continues.\"[163]\nA 2017 article in Foreign Policy asserted that in mid 2016 WikiLeaks turned down leaks on the Russian government during the US presidential campaign, stating \"the leak organization ignored damaging information on the Kremlin to focus on Hillary Clinton and election-related hacks\".[164] This was disputed by Wikileaks which said that as far as it could recall the material was \"already public\".[164] The cache had previously been reported on by the BBC and other news outlets to reveal details about Russian military and intelligence involvement in Ukraine.[164] The Foreign Policy article also argued that Assange's position on Russia had evolved. Assange's relationship with Russia \"started as adversarial\" as in he had in October 2010 \"teased a massive dump of documents that would expose wrongdoing in the Kremlin, teaming up with a Russian news site for the rollout\".[164] However, Assange by 2012 \"had his own show on the RT network and in 2016 Assange publicly criticised Novaya Gazeta's coverage of the Panama Papers, suggesting that \"reporters had \"cherry-picked\" the documents to publish for optimal 'Putin bashing, North Korea bashing, sanctions bashing, etc.' while giving Western figures a pass.\"[164] Russian investigative reporter Roman Shleynov said in an interview with the New York Times that it was a surprise for him to hear that \"Mr Assange was repeating the same excuse that our officials, even back in Soviet days, used to say \u2013 that it's all some conspiracy from abroad.\"[164]\nAssange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: \"I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgment and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ...\u00a0she certainly should not become president of the United States.\"[165] On 25 July, following the Republican National Convention (RNC), during an interview by Amy Goodman, Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. \"Personally, I would prefer neither.\"[166][167][168] WikiLeaks editor, Sarah Harrison, has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.[169] In an Election Day statement, Assange criticised both Clinton and Trump, saying that \"The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers.\"[170]\nIt was revealed in October 2017 that during the 2016 presidential election, Cambridge Analytica funder and substantial Republican donor Rebekah Mercer had proposed creating a searchable database for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain and then forwarded this suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who personally emailed a request to Assange for Clinton's emails.[171][172] Assange responded to the report by saying he denied Nix's request.[173]\nIn a July 2016 interview, Assange implied that Seth Rich, a DNC staffer who was murdered by an unknown assailant earlier that year, was the source behind the DNC emails that WikiLeaks published and that Seth Rich was killed for doing so. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's murder. Assange spoke about sources bringing information to WikiLeaks in the context of Seth Rich, and stated that whistle-blowers are at risk. When an interviewer said that Rich died as a result of \"just a robbery\", Assange said \"No. There's no finding.\"[174][175][176][177] Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election said that Assange \"falsely implied\" that Rich was the source to obscure that Russia was the actual source.[178][179][180]\nAssange's claims were highlighted by Fox News, The Washington Times and conspiracy website InfoWars.[181][182] According to a study by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, Assange's claims set off a spike in attention to the Seth Rich murder. According to the scholars, Assange's claims lent credibility and visibility to what had at that point been a conspiracy theory in the fringe parts of the Internet.[183] According to the Associated Press, the July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian officers by Special Counsel Robert Mueller undermined the idea that Seth Rich was the source for the DNC emails.[184] Similarly, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Assange knew Seth Rich could not have been his source for the hacked emails, because he continued corresponding with the Russian hackers after Rich's death.[178]\nOn 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seemingly presenting ways to undercut Bernie Sanders and showing apparent favouritism towards Clinton, leading to the resignation of party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.[185][186] The New York Times reported that \"Assange accused Mrs. Clinton of having been among those pushing to indict him\u00a0...\" and that he had timed the release to coincide with the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[187] In an interview with Robert Peston of ITV News, Assange suggested that he saw Hillary Clinton as a personal foe.[166][188] On 4 October 2016, in a WikiLeaks anniversary meeting in Berlin with Assange teleconferencing from his refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, reporters spoke of a supposed promise to reveal further information against Clinton which would bring her candidacy down, calling this information \"The October Surprise\".[189] On 7 October, Assange posted a press release on WikiLeaks exposing a second batch of emails with over 2,000 mails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.[190]\nCybersecurity experts and firms attributed the cyberattack to the Russian government.[19] The Central Intelligence Agency together with several other agencies concluded in a leaked secret report, that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the DNC servers, as well as the email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and leaked the stolen information to WikiLeaks to bolster Trump's chances of winning the presidency.[191] As result of the Special Counsel investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections 12 Russian military intelligence agents were indicted on 13 July 2018 for being behind the attack on the DNC mail-server. According to the special counsel's findings this group shared these mails using the pseudonym Guccifer 2.0 with other entities including Wikileaks.[192] The investigation also unearthed direct message exchanges between Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks, in which they coordinated the release of the shared material.[193] In interviews, Assange repeatedly denied that the Russian government was the source of the DNC and Podesta emails,[194][195][21] and accused the Clinton campaign of \"a kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria.\"[20] On the eve of the general presidential election, Assange wrote a press release addressing the criticism around publishing Clinton material on WikiLeaks, saying that WikiLeaks publishes \"material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere,\" that it had never received any information on Trump, Jill Stein, or Gary Johnson's campaign, and that therefore could not publish what it did not have.[196][197]\nAccording to Harvard political scientist Matthew Baum and College of the Canyons political scientist Phil Gussin, WikiLeaks strategically released emails related to the Clinton campaign whenever Clinton's lead expanded in the polls.[198]\nAssange was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Democratic National Committee in April 2018. The lawsuit alleged that WikiLeaks and Russian agents together engaged in a \"brazen attack on American democracy\" about the hacking and publication of its emails in 2016.[199] WikiLeaks sought to dismiss the suit, with its editor in chief Kristinn Hrafnsson calling the case \"a litmus test for press freedoms. The suit claimed that the scandalous emails of powerful political operatives are 'trade secrets' and cannot be published.\"[200]\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that the lawsuit \"raises several important press freedom questions\" including the determination of what activities should \"implicate a journalist in a source's illegal behaviour.\"[201] The organisation cited several First Amendment experts who opined that the lawsuit, if successful, might undermine the Supreme Court's precedents that publishers of information \"are not responsible for the illegal acts of their sources,\" such as Bartnicki v. Vopper.[201]\nThe suit was dismissed with prejudice in July 2019. In his judgement, Judge John Koeltl said that the defendants including Assange and Wikileaks \"did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place\" and were therefore within the law in publishing the information. He also said that the DNC case was \"entirely divorced\" from the facts. The suit could not be refiled due to its \"substantive legal defect\".[202]\nIn September 2017, Assange released \"Spy Files Russia,\" revealing \"how a St. Petersburg-based technology company called Peter-Service helped Russian state entities gather detailed data on Russian cellphone users, part of a national system of online surveillance called System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM).\" According to Moscow based journalist Fred Weir, \"experts say it casts a timely spotlight on the vast surveillance operations mounted by Russian security services.\"[203] The unexpected release of the material during the height of the Special Counsel investigation into the relationship between Wikileaks and Russia has drawn some criticism for not revealing anything groundbreaking and therefore looking more like an \"approved release direct from the Russian government\" as an attempt to detract from the investigation.[204][205]\nAfter WikiLeaks released the Manning material, United States authorities began investigating WikiLeaks and Assange personally to prosecute them under the Espionage Act of 1917.[206] In November 2010 US Attorney-General Eric Holder said there was \"an active, ongoing criminal investigation\" into WikiLeaks.[207] It emerged from legal documents leaked over the ensuing months that Assange and others were being investigated by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia.[208]\nIn December 2011, prosecutors in the Chelsea Manning case revealed the existence of chat logs between Manning and an alleged WikiLeaks interlocutor they claimed to be Assange;[209][210] he denied this,[211][212][213] dismissing the alleged connection as \"absolute nonsense\".[214] The logs were presented as evidence during Manning's court-martial in June\u2013July 2013.[215] The prosecution argued that they showed WikiLeaks helping Manning reverse-engineer a password, but the evidence that the interlocutor was Assange was circumstantial, and Manning insisted she acted alone.[216]\nIn 2013 US officials said that it was unlikely that the Justice Department would indict Assange for publishing classified documents because \"it would also have to prosecute the New York Times and other news organizations and writers who published classified material, including The Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper\".[217]\nAssange was being examined separately by \"several government agencies\" in addition to the grand jury, most notably the FBI.[218] Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that Assange was under \"active and ongoing\" investigation at that time.[219]\nMoreover, some Snowden documents published in 2014 show that the United States government put Assange on the \"2010 Manhunting Timeline\",[220] and in the same period they urged their allies to open criminal investigations into the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks.[221] In the same documents there was a proposal by the National Security Agency (NSA) to designate WikiLeaks as a \"malicious foreign actor\", thus increasing the surveillance against it.[220]\nIn January 2015, WikiLeaks issued a statement saying that three members of the organisation had received notice from Google that Google had complied with a federal warrant by a US District Court to turn over their emails and metadata on 5 April 2012.[222] In July 2015 he called himself a \"wanted journalist\" in Le Monde, in an open letter to the French president.[48] In a December 2015 court submission, the US government confirmed its \"sensitive, ongoing law enforcement proceeding into the Wikileaks matter.\"[223]\nUnder the Obama Administration the Department of Justice did not indict Assange because it was unable to find any evidence that his actions differed from those of a journalist.[224]\nWhen Mike Pompeo became CIA director, he and Jeff Sessions \"unleashed an aggressive campaign against Mr. Assange, reversing an Obama-era view of WikiLeaks as a journalistic entity\".[225]\nIn April 2017, US officials were preparing to file formal charges against Assange.[226] \nIn early 2019, individuals began to come forward with news of being questioned about Assange by prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia. Legal scholar Stephen Vladeck stated that the prosecutors, after refusing to unseal the indictment, accelerated the case in 2019 due to the impending statute of limitations on Assange's largest leaks.[227] Witnesses named in the investigation included Jacob Appelbaum, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, David House, Jason Katz and Chelsea Manning, all of whom condemned it as a form of government over-reach.[228]\nAssange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women.[10] He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was reopened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \"lesser-degree rape\" (Swedish: mindre grov v\u00e5ldt\u00e4kt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain.[11][229]\nOn 20 November 2010, the Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant via Interpol for Assange. On 8 December 2010 Assange gave himself up to British police and attended his first extradition hearing where he was remanded in custody pending another hearing. On 16 December 2010 at the second hearing, he was granted bail by the High Court and released after his supporters paid \u00a3240,000 in cash and sureties. A further hearing on 24 February 2011 ruled that Assange should be extradited to Sweden. This decision was upheld by the High Court on 2 November and by the Supreme Court on 30 May the next year.[230]\nAfter previously stating that she could not question a suspect by video link or in the Swedish embassy, prosecutor Marianne Ny wrote to the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2013. Her letter advised that she intended to lift the detention order and withdraw the European arrest warrant as the actions were not proportionate to the costs and seriousness of the crime. In response the CPS tried to dissuade Ny from doing so.[231]\nIn March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, Ny changed her mind about interrogating Assange, who had taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[232] These interviews, which began on 14 November 2016, involved the police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials, and were eventually published online.[233] By that time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \"lesser degree rape\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020.[234][235][236][237]\nOn 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities suspended their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\", she said.[238][239][240]\nFollowing Assange's arrest on 11 April 2019, the case was reopened under prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson. In September 2019, she revealed that she had interviewed seven witnesses, two of whom had not been previously heard, but had yet to determine how to proceed in the case.[241] On 19 November, she announced that she had discontinued her investigation into Assange, stating that after a comprehensive assessment, \"the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment\". She added that although she was confident in the complainant, \"the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed\". Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson welcomed the decision.[242]\nOn 19 June 2012, the Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, announced that Assange had applied for political asylum, that his government was considering the request, and that Assange was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[243][244][245][246]\nAssange breached bail conditions by staying in the embassy and faced arrest if he left. Assange's supporters, including journalist Jemima Goldsmith, journalist John Pilger, and film-maker Ken Loach, forfeited \u00a3293,500 in bail and sureties.[247][248] Goldsmith said she was surprised at his asylum bid and expected him to face the Swedish allegations.[249]\nJust before Assange was granted asylum, the UK government wrote to Pati\u00f1o stating that the police were entitled to enter the embassy and arrest Assange under UK law.[250] Pati\u00f1o criticised what he said was an implied threat, stating that \"such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna Convention\". Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service were stationed outside the building from June 2012 to October 2015 to arrest Assange for breaching the bail conditions and to compel him to attend court to face the extradition appeal hearing, should he leave the embassy. The police guard was withdrawn on grounds of cost in October 2015, but the police said they would still deploy \"several overt and covert tactics to arrest him\". The cost of the policing for the period was reported to have been \u00a312.6\u00a0 million.[251]\nWikileaks insiders stated that Assange decided to seek asylum because he felt abandoned by the Australian government. The Australian attorney-general at the time, Nicola Roxon, had written a letter to Assange's legal representative, Jennifer Robinson, in which she wrote that Australia would not seek to involve itself in any international exchanges about Assange's future. She also wrote that \"should Mr Assange be convicted of any offence in the United States and a sentence of imprisonment imposed, he may apply for an international prisoner transfer to Australia\". Assange's lawyers described the letter as a \"declaration of abandonment\".[252]\nAssange and his supporters said he was not concerned about any proceedings in Sweden as such, but believed that his deportation to Sweden could lead to politically motivated deportation to the United States, where he could face severe penalties, up to the death sentence, for his activities related to WikiLeaks.[7]\nOn 16 August 2012, Pati\u00f1o announced that Ecuador was granting Assange political asylum because of the threat represented by the United States secret investigation against him.[253][254][255][256] In its formal statement, Ecuador reasoned that \"as a consequence of Assange's determined defense to freedom of expression and freedom of press\u2026 in any given moment, a situation may come where his life, safety or personal integrity will be in danger\".[257] Latin American states expressed support for Ecuador.[258][259][260][261] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa confirmed on 18 August that Assange could stay at the embassy indefinitely,[262][263][264] and the following day Assange gave his first speech from the balcony.[265][266][267][268] An office converted into a studio apartment, equipped with a bed, telephone, sun lamp, computer, shower, treadmill, and kitchenette, became his home from then until 11 April 2019.[269][270][271]\nIn April 2015, during a video conference to promote the documentary Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, Mar\u00eda Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013 after France, Spain and Italy denied access to their airspace. \"It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences\", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan \"was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result was caused by the United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened.\"[272]\nIn an interview the following month with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, but Assange stated that \"the code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet\u00a0... and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn't think much more of it.\u00a0... We didn't think this was anything more than just distracting.\" Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.[273]\nOn 3 July 2015, Paris newspaper Le Monde published an open letter from Assange to French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in which Assange urged the French government to grant him refugee status.[48] In response to this letter, the French President said: \"France cannot act on his request. The situation of Mr Assange does not present an immediate danger.\"[274] On 4 July 2015, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, head of Assange's legal team, said that Assange had sent the open letter to French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande; but Assange had only expressed his willingness \"to be hosted in France if and only if an initiative was taken by the competent authorities\".[275]\nIn September 2016, Assange said he would agree to US prison in exchange for President Obama granting Chelsea Manning clemency.[276][277] Obama commuted Manning's sentence on 17 January 2017.[277] The next day, at his final presidential news conference, Obama stated, \"I don't pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance.\"[278] The same day, Assange's US-based attorney Barry Pollack asserted (without saying when or where) that Assange \"had called for Chelsea Manning to receive clemency and be released immediately\". Accordingly, Pollack maintained, the commutation\u2014which specified Manning would be freed four months thence\u2014did not meet Assange's conditions.[279] On 17 May 2017, Manning was released from prison.[280] Two days later, Assange emerged on the embassy's balcony and told a crowd that, despite no longer facing a Swedish sex investigation, he would remain inside the embassy to avoid extradition to the United States.[281]\nOn 17 October 2016, WikiLeaks announced that a \"state party\" had severed Assange's Internet connection at the Ecuadorian embassy.[282] The Ecuadorian government stated that it had \"temporarily\" severed Assange's Internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents \"impacting on the US election campaign\".[283] In an interview published on 29 December, Assange said, \"The Internet has been returned.\"[284]\nOn 15 July 2019, CNN obtained documents from an Ecuadorian intelligence official which confirmed that Assange continued to publish Wikileaks material while in the Ecuadorian embassy.[285] The documents also revealed that during the 2016 election in the United States, Assange met with dozens of people within the Ecuadorian embassy. These included employees from RT, for which Assange regularly produced media content, and two German hackers.[285]\nOn 6 June 2017, Assange tweeted his support for NSA leaker Reality Winner,[286] offering a $10,000 reward for information about a reporter for The Intercept who had allegedly helped the US government to identify Winner as the leaker.[287] Assange posted on Twitter: \"Reality Leight [sic] Winner is no Clapper or Petraeus with 'elite immunity'. She's a young woman against the wall for talking to the press.\"[288]\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's team had been investigating a meeting between former Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort and President Len\u00edn Moreno in Quito in 2017. Moreno talked with Manafort about removing Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and his extradition to the United States.[289]\nOn 28 March 2018, Ecuador cut Assange's Internet connection at its London embassy \"to prevent any potential harm\". Officials said that Assange's recent social media posts denouncing the arrest of Catalonian separatist leader Carles Puigdemont \"put at risk\" Ecuador's relations with European nations. Assange then went silent on social media.[290]\nIn May 2018, a team of Guardian journalists, including Luke Harding, reported that over a five-year span Ecuador had spent at least $5\u00a0million (\u00a33.7m) through a secret intelligence budget to protect Assange at its London embassy, \"employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police\". Visitors included \"individuals linked to the Kremlin\". Ecuadorian officials had reportedly also devised plans to help Assange escape should British authorities use force to enter the embassy and seize him. The Guardian also reported that documents and \"a source who wished to remain anonymous\" had indicated that, by 2014, Assange had \"compromised\" the embassy's communications system and arranged his satellite Internet hookup. \"By penetrating the embassy's firewall\", Assange was allegedly able to \"access and intercept the official and personal communications of staff\". According to The Guardian, this claim was denied by WikiLeaks as an \"anonymous libel aligned with the current UK\u2013US government onslaught against Mr Assange\".[291]\nOn 21 July 2018, Glenn Greenwald reported that the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry was finalising an agreement to release Assange into the custody of the British government.[292] In a press conference the following week, President Len\u00edn Moreno confirmed that he wanted Assange out of the embassy but also \"for his life not to be in danger\".[293] This prompted wide speculation that Moreno aimed to strengthen Ecuador's relations with the United States and assist their extradition efforts.[294]\nIn September 2018, Reuters reported that Ecuador had, in December 2017, granted Assange a \"special designation\" diplomatic post in Russia \u2013 and the cover to leave the embassy and England \u2013 but the British Foreign Office did not recognise diplomatic immunity for Assange and the effort was dropped.[295][296]\nOn 14 October 2018, ITV News reported that Assange's communications had been partially restored following a meeting between two senior UN officials and Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno.[297]\nOn 16 October 2018, congressmen from the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote an open letter to President Moreno which described Assange as a dangerous criminal and stated that progress between the US and Ecuador in the areas of economic co-operation, counternarcotics assistance and the return of a USAID mission to Ecuador depended on Assange being \"handed over to the proper authorities\".[298][299]\nOn 19 October 2018, BBC News reported that Assange was starting legal action against the government of Ecuador, accusing it of violating his \"fundamental rights and freedoms\".[300] Later that month, an Ecuadorian judge ruled against him, saying that a requirement for Assange to pay for his Internet use and clean up after his cat did not violate his right to asylum.[301]\nIn November 2018, Pamela Anderson, a close friend and regular visitor of Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy, gave an interview with 60 Minutes in Australia in which she asked the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to \"defend your friend, and get Julian his passport back, and take him back to Australia and be proud of him\".[302] Morrison rejected the request but his response was described as \"smutty\" and \"lewd\" by Anderson who wrote in an open letter to Morrison that \"[y]ou trivialised and laughed about the suffering of an Australian and his family. You followed it with smutty, unnecessary comments about a woman voicing her political opinion.\" She further advised Morrison that \"[r]ather than making lewd suggestions about me, perhaps you should instead think about what you are going to say to millions of Australians when one of their own is marched in an orange jumpsuit to Guantanamo Bay \u2013 for publishing the truth. You can prevent this.\"[303]\nIn December 2018, President Moreno reached an agreement to have Assange leave the embassy in what he called \"near liberty\". According to a radio interview by Moreno, British sources told him that Assange would be free to live in the United Kingdom without extradition after serving a prison sentence of at most six months. The formal offer was less explicit, simply stating that he would not be extradited to a country with the death penalty. Assange's lawyers declined, citing a need for further protection.[304]\nIn February 2019, the parliament of Geneva passed a motion demanding that the Swiss government extend asylum to Assange. The move was proposed by the Swiss People's Party and supported by the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland.[305] In the same month, it was revealed that Assange was issued with a new Australian passport in September 2018. His previous passport had expired several years ago.[306]\nIn 2015, la Repubblica lodged Freedom of Information requests in Australia, England, the United States and Sweden, seeking information about Assange. It said it was trying to discover whether US authorities told their UK counterparts in 2010 that they\u00a0intended to extradite Assange and also whether the Swedish investigation was used as a way of trying to extradite him to the US. la Repubblica said that its FOI requests had been hindered and delayed in all jurisdictions. However it said it was able to obtain evidence of the UK's role via the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in creating the \"legal and diplomatic quagmire\" which prevented Assange from leaving the Ecuadorian embassy. la Repubblica sued the CPS in 2017 to obtain further information but its case was rejected with the judge saying \"the need\u00a0for the British authorities\u00a0to protect the confidentiality of\u00a0the extradition process\u00a0outweighs\u00a0the public interest of the press to know\".[307] A further appeal was rejected in September 2019.[307][308]\nThe Ecuadorian government of Rafael Correa requested an advisory opinion from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the issue of \"the Institution of Asylum and its Recognition as a Human Right in the Inter-American System,\" and the court issued its advisory opinion in May 2018, upholding the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits signatories of the American Convention on Human Rights from deporting foreign individuals when such a deportation would likely lead to their persecution.[309] According to Doughty Street, the ruling was made shortly after US Vice-President Mike Pence raised the issue of Ecuador's grant of asylum to Assange while on a visit to Ecuador.[310]\nOn 5 February 2016, the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Assange had been subject to arbitrary detention by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison, on conditional bail and in the Ecuadorian embassy. According to the group, Assange should be allowed to walk free and be given compensation.[311][312] The UK and Swedish governments rejected the claim.[313] UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Hammond, said the claim was \"ridiculous\" and that the group was \"made up of lay people\", and called Assange a \"fugitive from justice\" who \"can come out any time he chooses\".[314] UK and Swedish prosecutors called the group's claims irrelevant.[315][316] The UK said it would arrest Assange should he leave the Ecuadorian embassy.[317] Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association, stated that the finding is \"not binding on British law\".[318] Noah Feldman, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, described the UN Working Group's conclusion as astonishing, summarising the conclusion as \"Assange might be charged with a crime in the US. Ecuador thinks charging him with violating national security law would amount to \"political persecution\" or worse. Therefore Sweden must give up on its claims to try him for rape, and Britain must ignore the Swedes' arrest warrant and let him leave the country.\"[319]\nThe Working Group again urged the UK to let Assange leave the Ecuador embassy in London freely. In a statement on 21 December 2018, the organisation asserted that the \"Swedish investigations have been closed for over 18 months now, and the only ground remaining for Mr Assange's continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK, which is, objectively, a minor offence that cannot post-facto justify the more than six years' confinement that he has been subjected to\".[320]\nIn 2019, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights rejected a complaint submitted by Assange, requesting that the Ecuadorian government \"ease the conditions it has imposed on his residence\" at the Ecuadorian embassy in London by monitoring him and restricting his visitors, and not allow him to be extradited to the United States.[321]\nIn 2019, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Prof. Nils Melzer stated that Assange had been subjected to mental torture [322] and demanded his release. He has repeatedly warned about Assange's deteriorating state of health. [323]\nIn April, Ecuador's president Lenin Moreno stated that Assange had violated the terms of his asylum, after photos surfaced on the internet linking Moreno to a corruption scandal.[324][325] WikiLeaks denied that it had acquired any of the published material, and stated that it merely reported on a corruption investigation against Moreno by Ecuador's legislature.[325] WikiLeaks subsequently wrote on Twitter that according to a source within the Ecuadorian government, an agreement had been reached to expel Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy and place him in the custody of UK police.[326][327] The source stated that the expulsion from the embassy would occur in retaliation against WikiLeaks' tweet noting corruption charges against Moreno.[326] Ecuador's Foreign Ministry denied the existence of any planned expulsion.[326][327]\nOn 11 April 2019, the Metropolitan Police were invited into the Ecuadorian embassy and arrested Assange in connection with his failure to surrender to the court in June 2012 for extradition to Sweden.[328] Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno stated that Ecuador withdrew Assange's asylum after he repeatedly violated international conventions regarding domestic interference.[329][330] Moreno referred to Assange as a \"spoiled brat\" and \"miserable hacker\".[331] British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the Ecuadorean president, Lenin Moreno, for co-operation and the British prime minister, Theresa May, said that \"no one is above the law\".[332] The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that Assange is \"not going to be given special treatment\u00a0... It has got nothing to do with [Australia], it is a matter for the US.\"[333]\nHours after Assange's arrest, programmer Ola Bini was arrested (but not charged) in Ecuador and interrogated about an alleged plot by unnamed Russian hackers to release compromising information about Moreno in retaliation. Bini had previously met with Assange at the embassy, posted a link to a news article about the plot to Twitter,[334] describing it as a \"witch hunt\", before leaving on a trip to Japan.[335]\nOn the afternoon of the day of his arrest Assange was charged with breaching the Bail Act 1976 and was found guilty after a short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.[336] Judge Michael Snow said Assange was \"a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest\" and he had \"not come close to establishing reasonable excuse\".[337] Assange was remanded to HM Prison Belmarsh, and on 1 May 2019 he was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court to 50 weeks imprisonment.[23] The judge said he would be released after serving half his sentence, subject to other proceedings and conditioned upon committing no further offences.[338] The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued a statement through the website of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights that the verdict contravened \"principles of necessity and proportionality\" for what it considered a \"minor violation\".[339][340] Assange appealed his sentence, but dropped his appeal in July.[341]\nOn 10 April 2019, WikiLeaks said it had uncovered an extensive surveillance operation against Assange from within the Ecuadorian embassy, asserting that videotapes of Assange taken at the embassy constituted an invasion of privacy. WikiLeaks said that \"material including video, audio, copies of private legal documents and a medical report\" had surfaced in Spain and that unnamed individuals in Madrid had made an extortion attempt.[342][343]\nOn 26 September 2019 the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that the Spanish defence and security company Undercover Global S.L. (UC Global) had spied on Assange for the CIA during his time in the Ecuadorian embassy. UC Global had been contracted to protect the embassy during this time. According to the report UC Global's owner David Morales had provided the CIA with audio and video of meetings Assange held with his lawyers and colleagues. Morales also arranged for the US to have direct access to the stream from video cameras installed in the embassy at the beginning of December 2017. The evidence is part of a secret investigation by Spain's High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, into Morales and his relationship with US intelligence. The investigation was precipitated by a complaint by Assange that accused UC Global of violating his privacy and client-attorney privileges as well as committing misappropriation, bribery and money laundering.[344]\nMorales was arrested in September on charges involving violations of privacy and client-attorney privileges, as well as misappropriation, bribery, money laundering and criminal possession of weapons. He was released on bail. On 25 September, Spanish Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata sent British authorities a European Investigation Order (EIO) asking for permission to question Assange by videoconference as a witness in the case against Morales. The United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA), which is in charge of processing and responding to EIOs in the UK, provisionally denied De la Mata's request to question Assange, raised a number of objections to the request, and asked for more details. De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK. He said that the crimes were partially committed on Spanish territory because the microphones used to spy on Assange were bought in Spain, and the information obtained was sent and uploaded to servers at UC Global S. L.'s headquarters in Spain.[345]\nSpanish judicial bodies were upset at having their EIO request denied by UKCA and believed the British justice system is concerned by the effect the Spanish case may have on the process to extradite Assange to the US.[345]\nIn a November 2019 article Stefania Maurizi said she had access to some of the videos, audios and photos from the embassy showing a medical examination of Assange, a meeting between Ecuadorian ambassador Carlos Abad Ortiz and his staff, a meeting between Assange, Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda and lunch between Assange and British rapper M.I.A. Microphones had been placed in the women's toilets to capture meetings between Assange and his lawyers. Phones belonging to some of the embassy's visitors were compromised. Spanish lawyer Aitor Martinez, who is part of Assange's legal team, said videos were taken of meetings between Assange and his legal defence team.  Maurizi concluded that, based on statements from former employees of UC Global, internal UC Global emails and the type of information collected, it was clear that the surveillance was conducted on behalf of the US government and the information gathered would be used by the US to assist in its case for extraditing Assange.[346]\nIn late November 2019 Britain agreed to allow Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata to interview Assange at Westminster Magistrates Court via video link on 20 December.[347] According to his lawyer, Assange testified that he was unaware that cameras installed by Undercover Global were also capturing audio and suggested the surveillance likely targeted his legal team.[348]\nIn 2012 and 2013, US officials indicated that Assange was not named in a sealed indictment.[349][350] On 6 March 2018, a federal grand jury for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a sealed indictment against Assange.[351]\nIn November 2018, US prosecutors accidentally revealed that Assange had been indicted under seal in US federal court; the revelation came as a result of an error in a different court filing, unrelated to Assange.[352][353][354][355][356]\nOn 11 April 2019, the day of Assange's arrest in London, the indictment against him was unsealed.[357] He was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion (i.e. hacking into a government computer), a relatively minor crime that carries a maximum 5-year sentence if found guilty.[358][359] The charges stem from the allegation that Assange attempted and failed to crack a password hash so that Chelsea Manning could use a different username to download classified documents and avoid detection.[224] This information had been known since 2011 and was a component of Manning's trial; the indictment did not reveal any new information about Assange.[224][360]\nOn 23 May, Assange was indicted on 17 new charges relating to the Espionage Act of 1917 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.[361] The Espionage Act charges carry a maximum sentence of 170 years in prison.[362] The Obama administration had debated charging Assange under the Espionage Act but decided against it out of fear that it would have a negative effect on investigative journalism and could be unconstitutional. The new charges relate to obtaining and publishing the secret documents. Most of these charges relate to obtaining the secret documents. The three charges related to publication concern documents which revealed the names of sources in dangerous places putting them \"at a grave and imminent risk\" of harm or detention. The New York Times commented that it and other news organisations obtained the same documents as WikiLeaks also without government authorisation. It also said it is not clear how WikiLeaks's publications are legally different from other publications of classified information.[363][364]\nMost cases brought under the Espionage Act have been against government employees who accessed sensitive information and leaked it to journalists and others.[365] Prosecuting people for acts related to receiving and publishing information has not previously been tested in court.[363] In 1975, the Justice Department decided after consideration not to charge journalist Seymour Hersh for reporting on US surveillance of the Soviet Union.[365] Two lobbyists for a pro-Israel group were charged in 2005 with receiving and sharing classified information about American policy toward Iran. The charges however did not relate to the publication of the documents and the case was dropped by the Justice Department in 2009 prior to judgement.[363][365]\nAssistant Attorney General John Demers said \"Julian Assange is no journalist\".[366] The US allegation that Assange's publication of these secrets was illegal was deemed controversial by Australia's Seven News as well as CNN.[364][367] The Cato Institute also questioned the US government's position which attempts to position Assange as not a journalist.[368] The Associated Press said Assange's indictment presented media freedom issues, as Assange's solicitation and publication of classified information is a routine job journalists perform.[369]\nStephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, stated that what Assange is accused of doing is factually different from but legally similar to what professional journalists do.[370] Vladeck also said the Espionage Act charges could provide Assange with an argument against extradition under the US-UK treaty as there is an exemption in the treaty for political offences.[364] Forbes magazine stated that the US government created outcry among journalists in its indictment of Assange as the US sought to debate if Assange was a journalist or not.[371] Suzanne Nossel of PEN America said it was immaterial if Assange was a journalist or publisher and pointed instead to first amendment concerns.[372]\nSeveral jurists, politicians, associations, academics and campaigners consider that the arrest of Assange constitutes an attack on freedom of the press and international law.[373][374][375] The Reporters Without Borders said Assange's arrest could \"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistle-blowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future.\"[376] Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, wrote that Assange's prosecution for publishing leaked documents is \"a major threat to global media freedom\".[377] Independent United Nations rights experts such as Agnes Callamard said \"the arrest of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange by police in the United Kingdom, after the Ecuadorian Government decided to stop granting him asylum in their London embassy, exposed him to the risk of serious human rights violations, if extradited to the United States\".[378]\nWikiLeaks was recognised as a \"media organisation\" in 2017 by a UK tribunal, contradicting public assertions to the contrary by some US officials, and possibly supporting Assange's efforts to oppose his extradition to the United States.[379][380][381][382] This is why the Dutch senator Tiny Kox asked the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatovic, whether the arrest of Assange and his possible extradition to the US are in line with the criteria of the European Convention on Human Rights, because Assange can benefit from the protection of the right to freedom of expression and information according the Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.[383]\nBritish Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed \"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and his extradition to the United States \"should be opposed by the British government\".[376]\nEva Joly, magistrate and MEP, said that \"the arrest of Julian Assange is an attack on freedom of expression, international law and right to asylum\".[384] Sevim Dagdelen, a German Bundestag MP who specialises in international law and press law, describes Assange's arrest as \"an attack on independent journalism\" and says that he \"is today seriously endangered\".[385][386] Dick Marty, a former state prosecutor of Ticino and rapporteur on the CIA's secret prisons for the Council of Europe, considers the arrest of whistleblowers \"very shocking\".[387][388] Several well-known Swiss jurists have asked the Federal Council to grant asylum to the founder of Wikileaks because he is threatened with extradition to the United States, which in the past \"silenced whistleblowers\".[389][390]\nThe French Union of Journalists (Syndicat national des journalistes (CGT)\u00a0[fr]), said that \"the dissemination of documents or information of public interest\" could not be considered a legal offence. The union called on Britain \"to refuse the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States and to release him.\"[391]\nIn a letter, several French Union of Journalists (Syndicat national des journalistes (CGT)\u00a0[fr]) and (Syndicat national des journalistes (CFDT)\u00a0[fr]) ask to Emmanuel Macron to enforce Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights . According them, \"Faced with threats to Julian Assange's health and at the risk of seeing him sentenced to life imprisonment, we are saying loud and clear, with the IFJ (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale des journalistes) that \"journalism is not a crime\". They add \"Julian Assange denounced in his publications war crimes condemned by the Geneva Convention. Today, he is the one we would like to imprison, we would like to silence. ..... We consider this case one of the most serious attacks on the freedom of the press, against public freedoms within the EU. The IFJ, the French unions and their Australian counterparts have launched a motion to seize this serious case the UN Human Rights Council and the European Parliament and the Council of Europe\".[392]\nThe yellow vests movement called for Assange's release.[393][394][395]\nWhile some US politicians supported the arrest and indictment of Julian Assange, several non-governmental organisations of press freedom condemned it.\nMark Warner, vice-chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, welcomed the arrest of Assange, saying that Assange was \"a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security\".[396] The president of the Center for American Progress and former Obama aide Neera Tanden also welcomed the arrest and condemned Assange's leftist supporters, tweeting that \"the Assange cultists are the worst. Assange was the agent of a proto-fascist state, Russia, to undermine democracy. That is fascist behaviour. Anyone on the left should abhor what he did.\"[396]\nThe deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Robert Mahoney, said \"With this prosecution of Julian Assange, the US government could set out broad legal arguments about journalists soliciting information or interacting with sources that could have chilling consequences for investigative reporting and the publication of information of public interest.[375] According Yochai Benkler, a Harvard law professor, the charge sheet contained some \"very dangerous elements that pose significant risk to national security reporting. Sections of the indictment are vastly overbroad and could have a significant chilling effect \u2013 they ought to be rejected.\"[375] Carrie DeCell, staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the charges \"risk having a chill on journalism\".[375] She added,\"Many of the allegations fall absolutely within the first amendment's protections of journalistic activity. That's very troubling to us.\"[375]\nBen Wizner from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) speculated that if authorities were to prosecute Assange \"for violating US secrecy laws [it] would set an especially dangerous precedent for US journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\"[397][398][397][398]\nNSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg condemned the indictment.[399][400] Snowden tweeted that \"Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom.\"[401] Daniel Ellsberg said \"Forty-eight years ago, I was the first journalistic source to be indicted. There have been perhaps a dozen since then, nine under President Obama. But Julian Assange is the first journalist to be indicted. If he is extradited to the U.S. and convicted, he will not be the last.  The First Amendment is a pillar of our democracy and this is an assault on it. If freedom of speech is violated to this extent, our republic is in danger. Unauthorized disclosures are the lifeblood of the republic.\"[402][403]\nAccording to Ron Paul, Assange should receive the same kind of protections as the mainstream media when it comes to releasing information. He said \"In a free society we're supposed to know the truth\u00a0 ... In a society where truth becomes treason, then we're in big trouble. And now, people who are revealing the truth are getting into trouble for it.\" He added \"This is media, isn't it? I mean, why don't we prosecute The New York Times or anybody that releases this?\"[404]\nIn October 2019 former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce called for the Federal Government to take action to stop Assange being extradited from the United Kingdom to the US. Later in October, the cross-party \"Bring Assange Home Parliamentary Working Group\" was established. Its co-chairs are independent MP Andrew Wilkie and North Queensland politician George Christensen. Its members include Greens Richard Di Natale, Adam Bandt and Peter Whish-Wilson, Centre Alliance MPs Rebekha Sharkie and Rex Patrick and independent MP Zali Steggall. The working group will request to visit Assange to determine what support they can provide.[405]\nFormer Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa condemned Assange's arrest.[406] Bolivian President Evo Morales also condemned it.[332] Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the indictment.[407][332] In January 2020, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted to oppose Assange\u2019s extradition to the US.[408]\nSince his arrest at the embassy, Assange has been incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh in London.[23]\nAfter examining Assange on 9 May 2019, United Nations special rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Nils Melzer concluded, \"in addition to physical ailments, Mr Assange showed all symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma.\"[409] The British government said it supported the important work of the rapporteur's mandate but disagreed with some of his observations.[410] In a later interview Melzer criticised the \"secretive grand jury indictment in the United States\", the \"abusive manner in which Swedish prosecutors disseminated, re-cycled and perpetuated their 'preliminary investigation' into alleged sexual offences\", the \"termination by Ecuador of Mr Assange's asylum status and citizenship without any form of due process\", and the \"overt bias against Mr Assange being shown by British judges since his arrest\". He said the United States, UK, Sweden and Ecuador were trying to make an example of Assange. He also accused journalists of \"spreading abusive and deliberately distorted narratives\".[411] Shortly after Melzer's visit, Assange was transferred to the prison's health care unit.[412]\nOn 13 September, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that Assange would not be released on 22 September when his prison term ended, because he was a flight risk and his lawyer had not applied for bail.[413] She said when his sentence came to an end, his status would change from a serving prisoner to a person facing extradition.[413]\nOn 1 November 2019, Melzer said Assange's health had continued to deteriorate and his life was now at risk.[414][412] He said that the UK government had not acted on the issue.\"[414][412] In November 2019, an open letter signed by more than 60 doctors said Assange's health was declining to an extent that he could die in prison.[415] On 30 December 2019, Melzer accused the UK government of torturing Julian Assange. He said Assange's \"continued exposure to severe mental and emotional suffering ... clearly amounts to psychological torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"[416][417]\nOn 2 May 2019, the first hearing was held in London into the United States request for Assange's extradition. When asked by the judge whether he consented to the extradition, Assange replied \"I do not wish to surrender myself for extradition for doing journalism that has won many, many awards and protected many people\".[418]\nOn 13 June, British Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he had signed the US extradition order.[419] On 14 June, a procedural hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court decided that a full extradition hearing should begin in February 2020.[420]\nOn 21 October 2019, Assange appeared at the court for a case management hearing. Judge Vanessa Baraitser denied Assange's defence lawyers' request for a three-month delay so that they could gather evidence. Government prosecutor James Lewis QC and the US opposed any delay.[421][422][423] When the judge asked about his understanding of the proceedings Assange replied:\n\"I don't understand how this is equitable. This superpower had 10 years to prepare for this case and I can't access my writings. It's very difficult where I am to do anything but these people have unlimited resources. They are saying journalists and whistleblowers are enemies of the people. They have unfair advantages dealing with documents. They [know] the interior of my life with my psychologist. They steal my children's DNA. This is not equitable what is happening here\".[421]In January 2020, both sides of the case asked for more time to prepare. The judge reluctantly agreed, scheduling one week of hearings from 24 February and another three weeks from 18 May.[424]\nAssange describes himself as an advocate of information transparency and market libertarianism.[425] He has written a few short pieces, including \"State and terrorist conspiracies\" (2006),[426] \"Conspiracy as governance\" (2006),[427] \"The hidden curse of Thomas Paine\" (2008),[428] \"What's new about WikiLeaks?\" (2011),[429] and the foreword to Cypherpunks (2012).[144] Cypherpunks is primarily a transcript of the World Tomorrow episode eight two-part interview between Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn, and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmermann. In the foreword, Assange said, \"the Internet, our greatest tool for emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen\".[144] He also contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997),[51] and received a co-writer credit for the Calle 13 song \"Multi_Viral\" (2013).\nAssange's book, When Google Met WikiLeaks, was published by OR Books on 18 September 2014.[430] The book recounts when Google CEO Eric Schmidt requested a meeting with Assange, while he was on bail in rural Norfolk, UK. Schmidt was accompanied by Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas; Lisa Shields, vice-president of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Scott Malcomson, the communications director for the International Crisis Group. Excerpts were published on the Newsweek website, while Assange participated in a Q&amp;A event that was facilitated by the Reddit website and agreed to an interview with Vogue magazine.[431][432][433]\nIn her 2017 documentary on Assange, Laura Poitras included a scene of him calling the Swedish sexual assault allegations a \"radical feminist conspiracy\"\u2014a comment which she says led them to part ways.[434] In 2011, Assange criticised a Private Eye article for portraying WikiLeaks contributor Israel Shamir as anti-Semitic. According to editor Ian Hislop, Assange called the article \"an obvious attempt to deprive [WikiLeaks] of Jewish support and donations\" and went on to point out that several journalists involved were Jewish. On 1 March 2011, Assange released a statement in which he said, \"Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase. In particular, 'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and word. It is serious and upsetting. We treasure our strong Jewish support and staff, just as we treasure the support from pan-Arab democracy activists and others who share our hope for a just world.\"[435][436]\n</body></html>"

A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the 27th District Attorney of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011 and 32nd Attorney General of California from 2011 until 2017. She ran as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 election, before dropping out on December 3, 2019.[2] Harris was born in Oakland, California, and is a graduate of Howard University and University of California, Hastings College of the Law. In the 1990s, she worked in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and the City Attorney of San Francisco's office. In 2004, she was elected District Attorney of San Francisco. Harris won the election as California's Attorney General in 2010 and was reelected in 2014 by a wide margin. On November 8, 2016, she defeated Loretta Sanchez in the 2016 Senate election to succeed outgoing Senator Barbara Boxer, becoming California's third female U.S. Senator, and the first of either Jamaican or Indian ancestry.[3] Since becoming a Senator, she has supported single-payer healthcare, federal descheduling of cannabis, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the DREAM Act, a ban on assault rifles, and lowering the tax burden for the working and middle classes while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest one percent of Americans. Kamala Devi Harris was born on October 20, 1964 in Oakland, California. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a Tamil Indian breast-cancer scientist who immigrated to the United States from Madras, India, in 1960 to pursue a doctorate in endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley).[4][5] Her father, Donald Harris, is a Stanford University economics professor who emigrated from Jamaica in 1961 for graduate study in economics at UC Berkeley.[6][7] Harris has one younger sister, Maya Harris.[8][9] Her mother chose to give them both Sanskrit names derived from Hindu mythology to help preserve their cultural identity.[10] She is also a descendant of a slave owner from Jamaica.[11] She identifies as black[12] and Indian, but sees her experience primarily as American.[13] Harris was raised in Berkeley, California.[14] She grew up attending both a Black Baptist church, where she and her sister sang in the choir, and a Hindu temple.[15][16] Her mother was an upper class Brahmin[17] from the Besant Nagar neighborhood of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, whose \"Gopalan\" bloodline can be traced over 1,000 years.[18] Shyamala was described as a \"feminist concerned that the women who did her laundry were the victims of domestic violence.\"[17] As a child, Harris used to visit her extended family in Chennai and was reportedly quite close to her maternal grandfather P. V. Gopalan, who was an Indian diplomat.[5][19] Harris began kindergarten during the second year of Berkeley's school desegregation busing program, which adopted the extensive use of busing to attempt to bring racial balance to each of the city's public schools; a bus drove her to a school which, two years prior, had been 95% white.[20][21] Harris' parents divorced when she was seven, and her mother was granted custody of Harris and her sister.[14][11] After the divorce, when she and her sister would visit their father in Palo Alto on the weekends, she stated that neighbors' kids were not allowed to play with them because they were black.[15] When Harris was 12, she and her sister moved with their mother to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where she had accepted a position doing research at Jewish General Hospital and teaching at McGill University.[22][23][24] She was a popular student at Westmount High School in Westmount, Quebec.[25] As a teenager, Harris co-founded a small dance troupe of six dancers that played at community centres and fundraisers.[26] Harris graduated from high school in 1981.[27][28] She went on to Howard University in Washington, D.C. where she double-majored in political science and economics, was elected to the liberal-arts student council, was on the debate team, organized mentor programs for local youth, demonstrated against apartheid, and joined Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.[29][30][29][17] Harris returned to California, where in 1989 she earned her Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.[7][31] She was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1990. Believing the world needed \"more socially aware prosecutors,\"[17] Harris decided to seek a career in law enforcement because she wanted to be \"at the table where decisions are made\".[7][32] In 1990, Harris was hired as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California where she was noted as being \"an able prosecutor on the way up.\"[33] She specialized in child sexual abuse trials, which she observed were a difficult type of prosecution, given juries are more inclined to accept the word of an adult over the word of a child.[17] \"Harris has a good courtroom presence, a high success rate. She is a genuinely good person and her social values will work well in San Francisco.\"[17] \u2013\u2013 Tom Orloff, Alameda District Attorney During this time, Harris also taught advocacy skills at Stanford and University of San Francisco.[34] Harris dated then-California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown from 1994 to 1995.[35][36][37] Brown began introducing Harris to his political network, resulting in Harris being increasingly featured in local newspapers and society columns. According to Jack Davis, the manager of Brown's campaign for mayor of San Francisco, \"'Brown [was] the darling of the well-to-do set... And she was the girlfriend, and so she met, you know, everybody who\u2019s anybody, as a result of being his girl.'\"[37] In 1994, Harris took leave of her position in Alameda County when Brown appointed her to the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board.[38][34][37] The position paid $100,000 per year.[35] Harris served on the board for six months. Then, during a lame-duck session, Brown appointed her to a three-year term on the California Medical Assistance Commission, overseeing Medi-Cal service contracts.[39][40] The Commission reportedly met about once per month and paid commission members over $70,000 per year.[38][39][34][17] Regarding these patronage positions, Harris has said: \"These jobs were created before I was born. Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work. I worked hard to keep St. Luke's Hospital open. I brought a level of life knowledge and common sense to the jobs. I mean, if you were asked to be on a board that regulated medical care, would you say no?\u201d[17] Harris ended her relationship with Brown shortly after his mayoral inauguration.[17] In 2003, she expressed frustration at being linked to Brown in the media; referring to him as an \"albatross hanging around my neck,\" she said, \"I have no doubt that I am independent of him\u2013\u2013and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me. His career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.\"[17] In 2015, she referred to Brown as \"a mentor and friend.\"[15] In February 1998, San Francisco District Attorney, Terence Hallinan, appointed Harris as an Assistant District Attorney.[41] She became the chief of the Career Criminal Division, supervising five other attorneys,[17] where she prosecuted homicide, burglary, robbery and sexual assault cases \u2013\u2013 particularly Three-Strikes cases.[17] Harris was noted as having been \"an excellent mentor\" in the office, and had been active in Hallinan's 1999 re-election campaign through his December election. However, eight months later, Harris quit.[33][42] Harris reportedly clashed with Hallinan's new chief assistant, Darrell Salomon \u2013\u2013 a former personal attorney to Senator Dianne Feinstein with connections to City Hall, but no criminal prosecuting experience.[33][43] Salomon was appointed in January after the previous chief, Richard Iglehart, was appointed to become a Superior Court Judge.[44]Salomon's appointment coincided with the introduction of a state ballot measure \u2013\u2013 Prop 21 \u2013\u2013 which would be voted on in an election held in three months.[42] The proposition would grant prosecutors the option of trying juvenile defendants in Superior Court rather than juvenile courts. This authority was usually only granted to judges and could have had a big impact in San Francisco where drug violations accounted for nearly 70% of prosecuted crimes.[42] Harris opposed the measure, as did Hallinan, who was the only District Attorney in the state to oppose the measure.[42] However, Harris, concerned about the possibility of nearly 40,000 kids per year \u2013\u2013 mostly minority \u2013\u2013 being tried in adult court, became very involved in campaigning against the measure, including attending rallies as a speaker, writing position papers and volunteering for the \"No-On-21\" campaign on weekends.[42] Her knowledge and commitment to the issue was such that the District Attorney's Public Information Officer at the time, Fred Gardner, would give reporters the option to interview both Harris and Hallinan. However, doing so reportedly made Hallinan suspicious that Harris was trying to usurp him in preparation of challenging him for the next election (in 2003).[42] Salomon approached Gardner and allegedly accused him of helping Harris: \"You're trying to make a star out of Kamala Harris.\"[42] Gardner dismissed the accusation, noting that \"she [Harris] is already a star,\" and was then reportedly told by Salomon to stop directing Prop 21 media inquiries to Harris as he believed Harris had \"an agenda\" given she was \"Willie Brown's protege.\"[42] Gardner confronted Harris and inquired if she was planning to run in 2003. She reportedly replied that it would be \"unprofessional\" to run against Hallinan if he decided to run for a third term.[42] Gardner relayed Harris' response to Hallinan. However, Gardner stated that Hallinan \"did not believe her.\"[42] Hallinan then ordered that all calls from reporters, not only those pertaining to Prop 21, go directly to him: \"I'm the elected official. I'm the D.A. It's my office. Except for my spokesman, I don't want anybody going to the media.\"[42] Hallinan then reassigned Harris, which Harris believed to be a de facto demotion, and set a canary trap to test her loyalty by divulging supposedly confidential information to her and watching to see if was leaked to the media.[42] It was, but the leaker turned out to be Hallinan himself, not Harris.[42] Shortly after her reassignment, Harris was a part of a group of supervisors who confronted Hallinan about Salomon, seeking to \"overthrow\" him.[17] However, when their attempt failed, Harris then filed a complaint against Salomon and quit.[33][17] The spokesman for the District Attorney's office called Harris' defection \"a sad day [because Harris was] a good lawyer, well-liked and brilliant.\"[33] Salomon resigned two weeks after Harris left.[43] He reportedly blamed Harris for \"stirring up resentment towards him.\"[42] In August 2000, Harris took a new job at San Francisco City Hall, working for elected City Attorney, Louise Renne.[33] Renne hired Harris to take the place of Katherine Feinstein, after Feinstein was appointed as a Superior Court Judge.[33][45][33] Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division representing child abuse and neglect cases, domestic violence, building code enforcement, and public health matters.[17][33] Renne said of Harris: \"She will make the best DA this city has seen in years.\"[17] Harris was reportedly so angry about the discontent in Terence Hallinan's office that she decided to run against him.[17] She began \"methodically gathering support\" by attending political events, volunteering on other campaigns, assuming board memberships on nonprofits, being seen at exclusive parties, and presenting herself as an alternative to a \"political has-been.\"[17] In mid-2002, Harris called Mark Buell, the stepfather of her friend, Summer Tompkins Walker, and told him of her intention to run for District Attorney against the two-term incumbent \u2013\u2013 and her former boss.[37] Buell was married to major Democratic megadonor, Susie Tompkins Buell. He was doubtful of Harris' candidacy as he had only thought of her as \"a socialite with a law degree\" However, Buell, impressed by Harris, offered to be her finance chair.[37] Buell advised that to beat an incumbent, Harris would need to raise more than $150,000, the highest amount ever raised to campaign for the position. He and Harris organized a finance committee composed mostly of Harris' friends, who were \"young socialite ladies\".[37] The committee included Vanessa Getty and Susan Swig. While Harris, saying that the black community was \"her base\",[17] set up her campaign office in Bayview \u2013\u2013 the \"most isolated neighborhood\" in San Francisco[37] \u2013\u2013 the committee arranged for her to \"routinely\" raise money in the exclusive neighborhood of Pacific Heights, with 25% of her donations coming from Pacific Heights alone: \"The crowd seems fascinated by Harris, an intelligent woman of color who speaks their language, who knows their first names, and who understands that as liberals, they want to maintain law and order \u2013\u2013 but with a certain San Francisco\u00adstyle noblesse oblige.\"[17] Harris was also seeking to run a campaign that disrupted negative stereotypes of black women:[17] \u201c...Black female candidates have to fight the perception that black women are not competent. When whites look at black women they see [them] as servants, maids or cooks...Being able to cross over into the white community is essential for any black, female or male, to succeed as a political figure. [They should] lay the groundwork by looking to become active on the boards of social, cultural and, charitable institutions like symphonies, museums, and hospitals. It\u2019s the way to get respect from a world that otherwise is content to eschew or label you.\"[46] \u2013\u2013 Willie Brown When Harris announced her candidacy, she had served on the board of trustees of the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco, had been a member of San Francisco Jazz Organization, was a patron dinner chair for the San Francisco Symphony's Black & White Ball, was the executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, led the board of directors of Partners Ending Domestic Abuse, and was a board member of nonprofit, Women Count. Harris was also documented attending exclusive events, dressing in luxury clothing such as Burberry, and dining with the heirs of billionaires:[37] \"...people wanted to be able to say they\u2019d met her and were supporting her because of this quasi-social network that we started with, and the more she raised, and the more she got traction, the more everybody else wanted to say they heard her, they talked to her and were supportive...but they were kind of professional socialites, and they wanted to help her. They saw it as a two-way street.\"[37] \u2013\u2013 Sharon Owsley, Socialite and Attorney In 2003, Harris entered the election, running against two-term incumbent and former boss, Terence Hallinan, and defense attorney, Bill Fazio.[47][48] Harris was the least known candidate among the three, but noted to be \"whip-smart, hard-working, and well-credentialed.\"[48][17] Hallinan and Fazio sought to link Harris to Willie Brown, who was openly campaigning and fundraising for Harris, through a PAC \u2013\u2013 California Voter Project \u2013\u2013 though reportedly without her consent.[17] Harris denied financially benefitting from Brown. However, Mark Buell later admitted that he met with Brown for lunch and Brown volunteered a campaign tactic to him.[17] Buell also admitted that Brown personally donated $500 \u2013\u2013 the individual donation maximum \u2013\u2013 to Harris after Summer Tompkins Walker reportedly asked Brown to donate while at a restaurant.[17] \"How can Harris root out corruption if she has Willie supporting her behind the scenes? I do not care that they had a relationship, but there are legitimate questions whether or not there is payback there.\"[17] \u2013\u2013 Bill Fazio However, Harris supporters said that statements used to tie her to Willie Brown were misogynistic. Harris' sister, Maya, asked: \u201cWhen a woman dates an accomplished man, why are people so willing to assume it's only because of him that the woman is successful?\" [17] Harris' mother stated: \"What has Willie Brown done for her? Introduce her to society people when they dated? If they did not like Kamala on her own right, they would have dropped her after she dropped Willie. Kamala is comfortable in all kinds of social scenes. She can pull it off in high society, too. She has the manners, the eating habits.\"[17] Harris' campaign later successfully lobbied the 24-member Central Committee \u2013\u2013 including U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and then-House Majority leader Nancy Pelosi \u2013\u2013 of the statewide Democratic party to deny their influential endorsement to either of Harris' competitors.[17] It was the first time the Central Committee had withheld its endorsement from an incumbent. Harris was found to be guilty, by the city's Ethics Commission, of violating campaign spending limit of $211,000, of which Harris had agreed to abide by before the campaign commenced.[48] Harris had overspent the pledged amount by nearly $100,000. The Commission's own staff was later accused of abusing its discretion, and favoring Harris, when it retroactively lifted the campaign spending limit after Harris' campaign had spent over the limit, and when Harris' campaign said that it was recognizing the Commission as the authority of the limit's forms rather than the Department of Elections.[48] The Commission denied the accusations, saying that its staff acted with its authority under local law.[48] Harris' supporters said her campaign mistakenly violated the spending cap due to a \"misinterpretation of confusing law changes\" on the forms.[48] They also argued that the cap put lesser-known candidates at a disadvantage, which was unfair since Harris had to spend more to increase her profile. However, critics charged that the forms were straightforward for any attorney to understand. Critics were also adamant that Harris willfully violated the spending cap and argued that, even if Harris mistakenly overspent the cap, that doing so was indefensible under the law.[48] Harris ran a \"Notice to Voters\" in newspapers stating that she never agreed to limit her campaign spending, but said her failure to file the form (to decline the campaign spending cap) on time on was \"due to errors by her campaign.\"[49] Harris' campaign lawyer also argued that the spending cap violated the First Amendment. Harris' campaign was questioned on why she would agree to the spending limit if it was, in fact, unconstitutional. Harris' campaign responded that political candidates face political pressure \"to accept rules that hinder their constitutional rights.\"[48] Harris was fined nearly $35,000 by the Commission and ordered to alert voters, in her mailers, that she had violated the spending limit. The mailers, subsequently produced by her campaign, were said to have displayed her spending violation with \"the smallest font in America.\"[48] Harris, who the San Francisco Examiner called \"a relative unknown\", went on to spend nearly $625,000 throughout the campaign while Hallinan spent just over $285,000.[50] It was more than four times more than any candidate had raised in the history of running for the office.[37] Harris garnered negative press from the campaign spending violation, but was said to have run a \"forceful\" campaign, assisted with the political and personal backing of former boyfriend, mayor Willie Brown, and connections to the city's high society.[50][37] Harris secured \"an impressive array\" of endorsements, including from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Sheriff Michael Hennessey, writer and cartoonist Aaron McGruder (who Harris noted was a close friend), and comedians Eddie Griffin and Chris Rock.[50][51][52] Bill Fazio had been eliminated from the election after initial voting. Hallinan and Harris, who garnered 37% and 33% of the vote, respectively, would have a runoff.[53] In the runoff, Harris sought to differentiate her policy positions from those of Hallinan, as it was a \"problem\" that they ideologically agreed on key issues such as being against the use of the death penalty.[17] Harris ran on making the sexual abuse of children her top issue.[54] She charged that, though she worked for Hallinan for two years, she left his office because it was \"dysfunctional,\" technologically inept and was \"a mess.\" She attacked Hallinan for promoting people in his office without merit, for his \"abysmal\" conviction rate for serious crimes (at just under 65%) \u2013\u2013 over 10 percent lower than his predecessor's rate \u2013\u2013 lowering office morale, and for his willingness to accept plea bargains in cases of domestic violence:[50][54][17] \"It is not progressive to be soft on crime.\"[17] \u2013\u2013 Kamala Harris, 2003 Hallinan refuted that Harris was misrepresenting his office. For example, he stated the decrease in conviction rate was not due to the performance of his office, but because of a diversion program that he created for criminals.[17] Harris was lauded for her campaigning skills, particularly for \"listen[ing] carefully to the concerns of ordinary people.\"[17] She was rumored to have worked 16 hours per day on her campaign, but was charged by critics as being a \"machine\" candidate more concerned with conviction rates than the people who were actually convicted:[54][17] \"It's not the tradition in San Francisco to favor punishment over rehabilitation. We are not concerned with the conviction rate, we don't want to come down hard on people accused of crimes, we don't want to nail them to the cross.\u201d[17] \u2013\u2013 Jeff Adachi, Public Defender, 2003 Harris also accrued negative publicity. Being upper middle class she was portrayed as being out of touch with her self-described \"black base.\"[17] She reportedly told a group of affluent blacks at Yerba Buena Gardens, along with affluent whites in Pacific Heights, \"The most victimized people do not vote, so you have to act on their behalf.\u201d[17] Also, while talking to three black men, outside of a Sunnydale housing project, who planned to protest the Muni transit system for not honoring its promise to hire young blacks to work on a new light-rail system, Harris suggested they \"ask a police captain to conduct a protest training [so] you can protest safely.\" The organizer of the protest, Harold Kyer, was reportedly embarrassed to have to explain to Harris that her suggestion was naive: \"Our community is not police-friendly, Ms. Harris. They will not come to a meeting if the police show up.\"[17] Harris faced additional criticism. Her support of Proposition M, which would increase criminal penalties for panhandling without providing funds for housing or health services for the homeless, conflicted with her liberal platform. However, the stance aligned her with Mayoral candidate, Gavin Newsom, whose campaign was supporting the initiative. Harris was also criticized, near the end of the campaign, for holding a press conference in which she vocalized a case about a woman who was tortured by her boyfriend with a hot iron, in order to attack Hallinan's record on domestic violence.[55] Harris did not talk to, or consult with, the victim prior to citing the case. However, Hallinan did speak with the victim and her family. The victim subsequently praised Hallinan for \"respect[ing] her desire not to have the case become a media spectacle.\" Harris was accused of politicizing the victim.[55] Harris won with 56.33% of the vote and became the first woman to lead the District Attorney's Office of San Francisco.[50] In April 2004, San Francisco Police Department Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty. Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the death penalty, angering the San Francisco Police Officers Association. During Espinoza's funeral at St. Mary's Cathedral, U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance. Harris still refused. Espinoza's killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.[7] In 2004, as district attorney, Harris started the Back On Track initiative, a reentry program.[7] Initiative participants (who are nonviolent, first-time drug offenders whose crimes were not weapon- or gang-related) plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a year-long period. Participants who succeed in obtaining a high-school-equivalency diploma, maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests have their records cleared.[56][57] Over eight years, the program produced fewer than 300 graduates, but achieved a very low recidivism rate.[7] In 2009, a state law (the Back on Track Reentry Act, Assembly Bill 750) was enacted, encouraging other counties to start programs around a similar model. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill into law.[58][59] The program met some controversy because it initially included illegal immigrants, including one, Alexander Izaguirre, who was later arrested for assault.[60] She later said allowing persons not eligible to work in the United States was a mistake,[60] and modified the program to bar anyone who could not legally be employed in the United States.[61] Harris was re-elected in 2007 when she ran unopposed.[62] A 2008 New York Times article listing women who might have the potential to become president of the United States listed then-District Attorney Harris, suggesting she had a reputation as a \"tough fighter.\"[63] In 2009, Harris's book Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer was published by Chronicle Books.[56] In the book, she touted her Back On Track initiative and argued for what she referred to as \"a smarter approach when it comes to combating nonviolent crime\" emphasizing crime prevention, truancy prevention, and the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in children.[56][57] The book discusses a series of \"myths\" surrounding the criminal justice system and presents proposals to reduce and prevent crime.[57] Recognized by The Los Angeles Daily Journal as one of the top 100 lawyers in California, she served on the board of the California District Attorneys Association and was vice president of the National District Attorneys Association.[64] In 2013, the San Francisco Weekly reported that the San Francisco Police Department and Harris's office shielded Abraham H. Guerra Sr., a high-ranking member of the Norte\u00f1o gang, from returning to prison due to parole violations because Guerra was an informant who provided authorities with information.[65] While Harris was the San Francisco District Attorney, the overall felony conviction rate rose from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade; there was an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and convictions of drug dealers increased from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.[66] In addition to trial convictions, she also closed many cases via plea bargains. When Harris took office, she cleared part of the murder caseload from the previous administration. She stated that the records from that administration were less than ideal, and worked to get convictions on what she could. Out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, over 40% of them took deals for lesser charges, such as manslaughter, pleaded to other crimes, such as assault or burglary while the murder charges were dismissed.[67] In 2004, Harris pushed for higher bail for criminal defendants involved in gun-related crimes. She argued that low bail encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco. Officers within the SFPD credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past. However, they also accused her of being too deliberate in her prosecution of murder suspects.[68] In 2009, Harris' prosecutors won a lower percentage of their felony jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California. Her at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76 percent, down 12 percent from the previous year, was more than 5 percent under the statewide average.[69] In 2012, Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that Harris's office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a San Francisco Police Department crime lab technician, that Harris' office had ignored a constitutional obligation to turn over to defense attorneys the criminal histories of police testifying at trial, and that Harris' office was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings.[70][71] In the 1970s, Joey Piscitelli was repeatedly raped by the principal of his Catholic High School, Father Stephen Whelan.[72] In 2004, he was pursuing a civil case against the church that oversaw his high school and seeking help to strengthen his case. Piscitelli had previously gone to the District Attorney's office when Terrance Hallinan was the D.A. and received the assistance he requested. Hallinan's office provided Piscitelli with access to files it had obtained in 2002 after Hallinan directed investigators to try to build a case against the archdiocese and forced the archdiocese to turn over 75 years of its own records.[72] The files implicated high-level church officials and detailed how they internally handled pedophile priests.[73][71] The files had been successfully used to indict a priest, Father Austin Peter Keegan.[72] Piscitelli intended to use the files in a similar manner, seeking any information that could be helpful in his civil suit against the church that oversaw his high school. At the time, a civil trial was the only avenue for restitution available to victims following a Supreme Court decision overturning a California law that retroactively eliminated the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution of child molestation cases.[72] Many sexual abusers who were facing criminal charges prior to the ruling were set free, including Keegan.[72][74] However, in 2003, California passed a state law that allowed victims to file civil lawsuits against their alleged abusers if they could prove that the employers of the abusers knew of the misconduct and did nothing to stop it.[72] Piscitelli's civil suit was already underway when he contacted Harris, shortly after she defeated Hallinan. Piscitelli says Harris's office did not respond to his letters or calls, and would not allow him to access the files. In response, Piscitelli and his family and friends began mounting posters across the city to force Harris to respond. He sought help from the media, which requested access to the files under California's Public Records Act, but Harris's deputy, Paul Henderson, denied the request, stating that Harris's investigative files \"were not subject to California's government transparency laws.\"[71] In 2005, when San Francisco Weekly writer Ron Russell attempted the request again, a Harris spokesperson told him: \"If we did it [granted access to files] for you, we would have to do it for everybody. Where do you stop, and where do you start?\"[71] Repeated attempts by reporters to access the files were similarly denied over the years, with Harris's spokesperson, Erica Derryck, not responding to calls or emails from reporters. Eventually, in 2010, Harris's office released a statement: \"District Attorney Harris focuses her efforts on putting child molesters in prison. We're not interested in selling out our victims to look good in the paper. When this case was brought under Terence Hallinan, prosecutors took the utmost care to protect the identity and dignity of the victims. That was the right thing to do then and it's the right thing to do now.\"[71] Critics charged that the statement was \"dangerous,\" as not exposing predators could endanger more children.[71] They argued that releasing such records was not only \"routine,\" but also cruel, in that it further burdened victims with having to resort to costly litigation if they wanted to obtain records that documented the crimes that happened against them.[71] Critics also charged that the statement implied that the district attorney's office was incapable of simply redacting victims' names from the released material.[71][72] They speculated that Harris, considering her political future, gave deference to the Catholic Church, noted to be a major political influence in San Francisco.[72] Supporters of Harris maintain she did the right thing in not releasing the documents: \"I don\u2019t think a district attorney should float that out there if a person can\u2019t defend themselves. It\u2019s a very serious charge, a sex crime.\"[72] \u2013\u2013 Elliot Beckelman, Former San Francisco Assistant District Attorney In 2006, Piscitelli won his civil case, doing so without the help of Harris's office.[75] During her seven years as District Attorney, Harris did not bring charges or proactively assist in civil cases against any sexual abusers in the church.[72] Critics charge that her failure to do so conflicts with her campaign promise to make the sexual abuse of children her top issue.[54][72] As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created a special Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the \"gay-transgender panic defense\", which has been used to justify violent hate crimes.[76] She supports same-sex marriage in California and opposed both Proposition 22 and Proposition 8.[77] In 2004, The National Urban League honored Harris as a \"Woman of Power\". In 2005, she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she received the endorsements of many groups including EMILY's List, California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, the National Women's Political Caucus, Mexican American Bar Association, and South Asians for Opportunity.[78] On November 12, 2008, Harris announced her candidacy for California Attorney General. Both of California's United States Senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, endorsed her during the Democratic Party primary.[79] In the June 8, 2010, primary, she was nominated with 33.6% of the vote, defeating Alberto Torrico (who received 15.6% of the vote) and Chris Kelly (who received 15.5%).[80] In her campaign for California Attorney General, Harris received the endorsements of United Farm Workers cofounder Dolores Huerta, United Educators of San Francisco, and San Francisco Firefighters Local 798.[78] She also received the endorsement of Antonio Villaraigosa, Mayor of Los Angeles.[81] In the general election, she faced Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley. On election night, November 2, 2010, Cooley prematurely declared victory, but many ballots remained uncounted. On November 24, as the count advanced, Harris was leading by more than 55,000 votes, and Cooley conceded.[82] On January 3, 2011, she became the first female,[64] Jamaican-American,[81][83] and Indian-American attorney general in California.[84][85] Harris announced her intention to run for re-election in February 2014 and filed paperwork to run on February 12. According to the office of California Secretary of State Debra Bowen, Harris had raised the money for her campaign during the previous year in 2013.[86] The Sacramento Bee,[87] Los Angeles Daily News,[88] and Los Angeles Times endorsed her for reelection.[89] On November 4, 2014, Harris was re-elected against Republican Ronald Gold.[90] In 2012, Harris participated in the National Mortgage Settlement against five banks, securing $12 billion of debt reduction for the state's homeowners and $26 billion overall.[91][92] She introduced the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights in the California State Legislature, a set of laws which took effect on January 1, 2013, banning the practices of \"dual-tracking\" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and robo-signing, and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution. It also gave the California Attorney General more power to investigate and prosecute financial fraud and to convene special grand juries to prosecute multi-county crimes instead of prosecuting a single crime county by county.[93][94] After the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Plata (2011) declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted cruel and unusual punishment, Harris fought federal court supervision, explaining \"I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client.\"[7] After California failed to fully implement the court's order to reduce crowding, and was ordered to implement new parole programs, the State of California appealed the decision, and in court filings the AG's office argued that if forced to release these inmates early, prisons would lose an important source of labor,[95] such as for fighting wildfires.[96] Prisoners in California earn between 8 and 37 cents per hour in maintenance and kitchen jobs;[95] prisoner firefighters receive higher pay, at $1 per hour.[96] She later backed away from her office's argument in the prison-litigation case, telling the website ThinkProgress: \"The way that argument played out in court does not reflect my priorities... The idea that we incarcerate people to have indentured servants is one of the worst possible perceptions. I feel very strongly about that. It evokes images of chain gangs.\"[96][97] In 2017, she introduced legislation to \"reform or replace the practice of money bail.\"[98] Harris refused to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives Proposition 36 (2012) and Proposition 47 (2014), arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.[7] Former California Attorney General John Van de Kamp considered her explanation \"baloney.\"[7] Harris has prosecuted many financial crimes, such as predatory lending.[99] In 2011, while serving as Attorney General of California, she created the Mortgage Fraud Strike Force which had a mandate to eliminate mortgage foreclosure fraud. The task force has been criticized for not filing as many foreclosure cases as in states with smaller populations.[100] In 2013, Harris did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin's bank OneWest despite evidence \"suggestive of widespread misconduct\" according to a leaked memo from the Department of Justice.[101][102] In 2017, she said that her office's decision not to prosecute Mnuchin was based on \"following the facts and the evidence...like any other case\".[103] In 2016, Mnuchin donated $2,000 to her campaign,[104] making her the only 2016 Senate Democratic candidate to get cash from Mnuchin,[105] but as senator, she voted against the confirmation of Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury.[105][106] In 2012, Harris sent a letter to 100 mobile-app developers, asking them to comply with California law with respect to privacy issues.[107] If any developer of an application that could be used by a Californian does not display a privacy policy statement when the application is installed, California law is broken, with a possible fine of $2500 for every download. The law affects any developer anywhere in the world if the app is used by a Californian.[108] In February 2014, Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, a transgender woman incarcerated at California's Mule Creek State Prison, filed a federal lawsuit based on the state's failure to provide her with what she argued was medically necessary sex reassignment surgery (SRS).[109] In April 2015, a federal judge ordered the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to provide Norsworthy with SRS, finding that prison officials had been \"deliberately indifferent to her serious medical need.\"[110][111] Harris, representing CDCR, challenged the order in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.[112] She argued that \"Norsworthy has been receiving hormone therapy for her gender dysphoria since 2000, and continues to receive hormone therapy and other forms of treatment\" and that \"there is no evidence that Norsworthy is in serious, immediate physical or emotional danger.\"[113] In August 2015, while the state's appeal was pending, Norsworthy was released on parole, obviating the state's duty to provide her with inmate medical care[114] and rendering the case moot.[115] Harris maintained that the parole review process was independent of Norsworthy's legal case against CDCR, although the Ninth Circuit, in its opinion, said it was possible that Norsworthy's release on parole, ahead of her scheduled SRS, may have been influenced by CDCR officials.[115] On February 12, 2015, Harris announced that she would start a new agency called the Bureau of Children's Justice. The bureau would work on issues such as foster care, the juvenile justice system, school truancy, and childhood trauma. She appointed special assistant attorney general Jill Habig to head the agency.[116] In 2015, Harris defended convictions obtained by county prosecutors who had inserted a false confession into an interrogation transcript, committed perjury, and withheld evidence.[7] Federal appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski threw out the convictions, telling lawyers, \"Talk to the attorney general and make sure she understands the gravity of the situation.\"[7] In March 2015, a California superior courts judge ordered Harris to take over a criminal case after Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas was revealed to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.[7] She refused, appealing the order and defending Rackauckas.[7] Harris appealed the dismissal of an indictment when it was discovered a Kern County prosecutor perjured in submitting a falsified confession as court evidence. In the case, she argued that only abject physical brutality would warrant a finding of prosecutorial misconduct and the dismissal of an indictment, and that perjury alone was not enough.[117][118] After an oil spill from a pipeline caused damage to the California coastline in May 2015, Harris toured the coastline and directed her office's resources and attorneys to investigate possible criminal violations.[119] The investigations led to dozens of indictments.[120] In June 2016, she issued subpoenas to Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, Phillips 66, Valero Energy, and Tesoro relating to an investigation into possible price-fixing.[121] Mitrice Richardson was a 24-year-old African American woman who was released from the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department in the middle of the night without any means of fending for herself. Her body was later found in an isolated canyon, leaving the family with many unanswered questions. In 2016, the Attorney General opened a criminal investigation into the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's handling of the Mitrice Richardson case. The AG's Office had originally declined the request of the Richardson family to investigate the case, but reversed course after the family and supporters submitted almost 500 pages of evidence to Harris's office in the hope of prompting an investigation.[122][123][124] In December 2016, the California Attorney General's Office closed the investigation, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support criminal prosecution of anyone involved in the handling of the Richardson case.[125] In October 2016, Harris announced the arrest of Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer on felony charges of pimping a minor, pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping. The arrest warrant alleged that 99% of Backpage's revenue was directly attributable to prostitution-related ads, many of which involved victims of sex trafficking, including children under the age of 18.[126] The pimping charge against Ferrer was dismissed by the California courts in 2016 on the grounds of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but in 2018 Ferrer ultimately pleaded guilty in California to money laundering and agreed to give evidence against the former co-owners of Backpage, Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.[127] Ferrer simultaneously pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and conspiracy to facilitate prostitution in Texas state court and Arizona federal court.[127][128][129] In January 2017, following government pressure, Backpage announced that it was removing its adult section from all of its sites in the United States.[130] Harris welcomed the move, saying \"I look forward to them shutting down completely.\"[131] The investigations continued after she became a senator and in April 2018, Backpage and affiliated sites were seized by federal law enforcement around the same time as Ferrer's guilty plea.[128] During Obama's presidency, Harris was mentioned as a possible nominee for the United States Supreme Court[132][133] or U.S. Attorney General,[134] but she was not nominated to either office.[135] After 24 years as California's junior senator, Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced her intention to retire from the United States Senate at the end of her term in 2016. Harris was the first candidate to declare her intention to run for Boxer's senate seat. Media outlets reported that she would run for senate on the same day that Gavin Newsom, California's Lieutenant Governor and a close political ally of Harris, announced he would not seek to succeed Boxer.[136] Harris officially announced the launch of her campaign on January 13, 2015.[137] Harris hosted fundraisers in California and Washington, D.C., raising $2.5 million for her campaign.[138] In December 2015, the National Journal reported that Harris' campaign spending rate contributed to her cash on hand being closer to that of another candidate, Loretta Sanchez, who had just $1.6 million.[139][140] In 2016, Harris was the only Democratic candidate for the Senate to receive a campaign contribution from Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin donated $2,000 to Harris' campaign.[141] Harris was criticized for accepting the donation because Mnuchin profited from the subprime mortgage crisis and when Harris was the Attorney General of California, she declined, without explanation, to prosecute OneWest Bank \u2013\u2013 which Mnuchin founded and ran \u2013\u2013 over foreclosures the bank executed while incurring over 1,000 violations to California foreclosure laws (and despite the recommendations of investigators in her own office to file a civil enforcement action against the bank), and because Harris was afforded a vote in Mnuchin's 2017 confirmation to become United States Secretary of the Treasury.[141][142][102] The Intercept said of Harris' fundraising: \"Harris\u2019s prodigious fundraising also raises questions about how attentive she is to the needs of campaign contributors.\"[102] Harris was a frontrunner from the beginning of her campaign. In January 2015, weeks after she announced her campaign, a survey by Public Policy Polling showed her leading in a hypothetical match-up against Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, 41% to 16%, respectively.[143] Four months later, a Field Poll showed that though nearly 60% of likely voters did not have a favored candidate, at nearly 20%, she was most preferred candidate of the field.[144] Five months later, she led another Field Poll, at 30%, besting fellow Democratic candidate, Loretta Sanchez, by nearly 15 percentage points. Harris increased her support despite The Sacramento Bee noting she had not been active in campaigning since appearing at the California Democratic Party's convention.[145] In February 2016, the California Democratic Party voted at its convention to endorse Harris, who received nearly 80% of the vote, with only 60% needed to secure the endorsement.[146][147] Three months later, Governor Jerry Brown endorsed her.[148] On July 19, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Harris.[149] All candidates participated in a primary election in June 2016, after which the top two candidates from any party would advance to the general election.[147] Harris entered the debates against the other major candidates as the front-runner.[150][151] On the June 7 primary, she came in first place with 40% of the votes, winning in over 80% of California's 58 counties \u2013\u2013 including seven counties where she won more than 50% of the vote.[152][153] Following the primary, Harris faced Congresswoman, and fellow Democrat, Loretta Sanchez, in the general election.[154] It was the first time a Republican did not appear in a general election for the Senate since California began directly electing senators in 1914.[155] In the November 2016 election, Harris defeated Sanchez, capturing over 60% of the vote, carrying all but four counties.[156] Following her victory, she promised to protect immigrants from the policies of President-elect Donald Trump.[157] Following her election to the United States Senate, Harris announced her intention to remain California's Attorney General through the end of 2016 and resign shortly before being sworn in as Senator on January 3, 2017.[158] Governor Jerry Brown announced his intention to nominate Congressman Xavier Becerra as her successor.[159] On January 28, after Trump signed Executive Order 13769, barring citizens from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, she condemned the order and was one of many to describe it as a \"Muslim ban\".[160][161] When John F. Kelly was White House Chief of Staff, she called him at home to gather information and push back against the contentious executive order.[162] In early February, Harris spoke in opposition to Trump's cabinet picks Betsy DeVos, for Secretary of Education,[163] and Jeff Sessions, for United States Attorney General.[164] Later that month, in her first speech on the senate floor, she spent 12 minutes critiquing Trump's immigration policies.[165] In early March, she called on Attorney General Sessions to resign, after it was reported that Sessions spoke twice with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.[166] On March 14, she argued that repealing the Affordable Care Act would send the message of health care's being a \"privilege\" rather than a \"civil right\".[167]On June 7, 2017, Harris garnered media attention for her questioning of Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, over the role he played in the May 2017 firing of James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[168] The prosecutorial nature of her questioning caused Senator John McCain, an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman, to interrupt her and request that she be more respectful of the witness;[168] other Democrats on the committee pointed out that they had asked similarly tough questions, but had not been interrupted.[168] On June 13, she questioned Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, on the same topic;[169] She was again interrupted by McCain and Burr.[169] Sessions stated that her mode of questioning \"makes me nervous\";[169] other Democratic members of the committee again pointed out that she was the only senator whose questioning was interrupted with an admonishment from the chairman.[169] Burr's singling out of Harris sparked suggestion in the news media that his behavior was sexist, with commentators arguing that Burr would not treat a male Senate colleague in a similar manner.[170] In addition, when CNN pundit Jason Miller described her as \"hysterical\", Kirsten Powers, who was taking part in the same on-air segment, told Miller that his use of the term to describe Harris was sexist, and that he would not describe male senators in the same manner.[171] In July 2017, Harris voted in favor of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea.[172] In a January 2018 hearing, Harris questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for favoring Norwegian immigrants over others and claiming to be unaware that Norway is a predominantly white country.[173] In an April 2018 hearing, Harris questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for Facebook's misuse of users' data.[174] In response to the administration's family separation policy, Harris visited one of the detention facilities near the border in June 2018.[175] In the September and October 2018 Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Harris participated in questioning the FBI Director's limited scope of the investigation on Kavanaugh.[176] Harris was one of the targets of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts.[177] In February 2019, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted, \"It's all about the Benjamins baby\" in reference to American politicians' support for Israel and invoked the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). A number of Democratic leaders\u00a0\u2013 including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0\u2013 condemned the tweet, which was interpreted as implying that money was fueling American politicians' support of Israel.[178] Harris defended Ilhan Omar, saying that \"We should be having a sound, respectful discussion about policy. You can both support Israel and be loyal to our country. I also believe there is a difference between criticism of policy or political leaders, and anti-Semitism.\"[179] Source: Los Angeles Times Harris had been considered a top contender and potential frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination for President.[183][184][185] In June 2018, she was quoted as \"not ruling it out.\"[186] In July 2018, it was announced that she would publish a memoir, a sign of a possible run.[187] As of that month, she was spending more on Facebook advertising than any other senator.[188] She also stumped for candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.[189][190][191] On January 21, 2019, Harris officially announced her candidacy for President of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election.[192] In the first 24 hours after her candidacy announcement, she tied a record set by Bernie Sanders in 2016 for the most donations raised in the day following an announcement.[193] However, Sanders later broke this record after announcing his own 2020 presidential campaign.[194] Over 20,000 people attended her formal campaign launch event in her hometown of Oakland, California on January 27, according to a police estimate.[195] During the first Democratic presidential debate in June 2019, Harris scolded former vice president Joe Biden for having opposed mandatory school bussing. Her widely quoted comment was, \"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.\"[196][197] Harris's support rose by between 6 and 9 points in polls following that debate.[198][199] In the second debate in August, Harris was confronted by Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard over her record as Attorney General, notably her past positions on marijuana, cash bail, and parole reform.[200] Harris fell in the polls following that debate.[201] Over the next few months her poll numbers fell to the low single digits.[202] On December 3, 2019, Harris withdrew from seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination,[203][204][205] citing a shortage of funds to continue her campaign.[206] In 2013, when she was California Attorney General, Harris allowed the Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian to cease the availability of elective abortions, after it entered a partnership with Catholic chain, St. Joseph Health System.[207] The ban was made due to St. Joseph's \"sensitivity\" about abortion. As the Attorney General, Harris had legal authority to decide on any such change, as a condition of her approving a major transaction involving any non-profit medical institution in the state.[207] The ban would not be able to go into affect without her knowledge or approval.[207] Harris did set conditions on the ban, requiring the hospital to \"take steps to ensure that alternative providers are available and accessible to all women, especially low-income women for direct abortions\" in the hospital's serviceable area.[207] Critics voiced concern that by imposing Catholic doctrine on its operations, St. Joseph was reducing the availability of reproductive services while receiving millions of dollars from taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and a legal status that allowed it to be tax-exempt while taking tax deductions.[207] In July 2015, an organization called \"The Center for Medical Progress\" (dba \"Biomax\"), a registered California non-profit corporation posted five videos, shot in Texas, as evidence of proof that Planned Parenthood was \"illegally trafficking aborted fetal parts.\"[208] The videos were found to be manipulated \u2013\u2013 propaganda produced by anti-abortion activists who used fake California identification to establish a ghost California non-profit corporation.[209] Within two months of the videos' posting, a Texas grand jury indicted the two activists responsible for producing them. However, as of March 2016, Harris had yet to make any determination on the matter: \"In July, our politically ambitious attorney general, Kamala Harris, vowed to 'carefully review' the 'Center for Medical Progress...what is [she] waiting for?'[209] While a spokesperson for Harris said that \"the office does not comment on investigations, or even confirm whether an investigation exists,\" abortion rights advocates began to speculate that Harris' senatorial campaign to replace Barbara Boxer might have contributed to Harris' \"lack of urgency\" on the case.[209] However, in September 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed \"Assembly Bill 1671\" into law, which was reportedly drafted by Harris, with input from Planned Parenthood \u2013\u2013 which sponsored the bill \u2013\u2013 making it a criminal offense to intentionally distribute, or to help with the dissemination of, unlawfully obtained confidential communications.[210][211] Libertarians, filmmakers and news organizations vehemently opposed the bill which was signed into law after late amendments were added to it.[212] Since her election to the Senate, Harris has maintained a 100% rating by the abortion rights advocacy group, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and a 0% rating by the anti-abortion group, National Right to Life Committee.[213] She was also endorsed by Emily's List in 2015 during her Senatorial Campaign.[214] Harris's 2020 campaign has disavowed most corporate donations, and has committed to rejecting money from corporate political action committees for her presidential campaign, in favor of relying on small and large individual donors.[215][216][217] \"Our campaign is not taking a dime from corporate PACs or lobbyists \u2013\u2013 and that was a very deliberate choice.\"[218] However, in April 2019, after the FEC released donation information, Harris was found to have accepted more donations from registered lobbyists among all the Democratic Presidential Nominees who vowed to not do so,[218] receiving such donations from federal, state, municipal and corporate lobbyists who represent entities such as Verizon, Airbnb, AT&T, Novartis, Visa, Pfizer, Cigna, IBM, Google, along with lobbyists that represent industries such as charter schools, construction, and real estate.[218] Harris, along with candidates Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Marianne Williamson, has explicitly discouraged single-candidate super PACs from operating on her behalf, though she cannot prevent them from doing so.[219] In the first quarter of 2019, nearly 40% of Harris's donations came from small donors (donations of less than $200), while over 60% of her donations came from large donors (donations of $200 or more).[220] Harris did not initially support the legalization of recreational marijuana, but later moved to support legalization.[215] In 2010, while campaigning for Attorney General of California, she opposed Proposition 19, the first failed attempt to legalize recreational marijuana in California, on the grounds that selling drugs harms communities.[221] In 2015, she called for an end on the federal prohibition of medical marijuana.[222] In April 2018, following reports that the Justice Department was blocking the Drug Enforcement Administration from taking action on over two dozen requests to grow marijuana for use in research, Harris and Republican Orrin Hatch sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the necessity of marijuana research \"for evidence-based decision making\" and \"to resolve critical questions of public health and safety, such as learning the impacts of marijuana on developing brains and formulating methods to test marijuana impairment in drivers.\"[223] In May 2018, Harris announced she would co-sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act (originally introduced by Senator Cory Booker in August 2017) which would legalize cannabis at the federal level by removing it from the Controlled Substance Act. The bill would also require federal courts to automatically expunge earlier federal marijuana convictions related to use or possession and would penalize states that enforce cannabis laws in a disproportionate manner against minority or low-income individuals.[224][225] In July 2019, Harris and Representative Jerry Nadler introduced the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019, legislation that would legalize marijuana on the federal level in addition to expunging low-level marijuana possession convictions and authorizing grants to members of communities of color as part of an effort to reverse decades of damage cannabis criminalization had inflicted to those respective communities. In a statement, Harris cited the need to regulate marijuana and ensuring \"everyone \u2014 especially communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs \u2014 has a real opportunity to participate in this growing industry.\"[226] Harris is opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually.[227] Her position was questioned in April 2004, when SFPD Officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. She announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. The decision evoked protests from the San Francisco Police Officers Association, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others.[7] Those who supported her decision not to seek the death penalty included San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Sophie Maxwell, in whose district the murder occurred.[228] The jury found the convicted killer, David Hill, guilty of second-degree murder, although the prosecutor, Harry Dorfman, had sought a first-degree murder conviction.[229] The defense had argued that Hill thought Espinoza was a member of a rival gang, and that the murder was not premeditated. Hill was given the maximum sentence for the conviction, life without the possibility of parole.[229] Harris's position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.[60] On September 10, 2009, she announced she would seek life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case.[230] Harris has expressed the belief that life without possibility of parole is a better, and more cost-effective, punishment.[231] According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, the death penalty costs $137 million per year.[232] If the system were changed to life without possibility of parole, the annual costs would be approximately $12 million per year.[232] She noted that the resulting surplus could put 1,000 more police officers into service in San Francisco alone.[231] When in 2014, U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney declared capital punishment in California unconstitutional, Harris appealed the case.[7] On July 31, 2019, following Attorney General William Barr announcing that the United States federal government would resume the use of the death penalty for the first time in over twenty years, Harris was a cosponsor of a bill banning the death penalty.[233] In August 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sign a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency charging the agency with not assisting displaced homeowners in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria under the Individuals and Households program (IHP) at \"alarming rates.\"[234] Harris has argued for treating \"habitual and chronic truancy\" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children.[235] She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.[236][237] She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.[78] Harris opposed California's ban on affirmative action.[238] She asked the Supreme Court to \"reaffirm its decision that public colleges and universities may consider race as one factor in admissions decisions.\"[239][240] Harris filed legal papers in the Supreme Court case supporting race as an admissions factor at the University of Texas.[239] She also filed papers supporting affirmative action in a different Supreme Court case involving the University of Michigan.[241] Harris supports busing for desegregation of public schools, saying that \"the schools of America are as segregated, if not more segregated, today than when I was in elementary school.\"[242] Harris views busing as an option to be considered by school districts, rather than the responsibility of the federal government.[243] On December 21, 2017, Harris was one of six senators to introduce the \"Secure Elections Act\", legislation authorizing block grants for states that would update outdated voting technology. The act would also create a program for an independent panel of experts to develop cybersecurity guidelines for election systems that states could adopt if they choose, along with offering states resources to implement the recommendations.[244] In May 2019, Harris was a cosponsor of the Protecting American Votes and Elections (PAVE) Act, legislation granting the United States Department of Homeland Security the authority \"to set minimum cybersecurity standards for U.S. voting machines, authorize a one-time $500 million grant program for states to buy ballot-scanning machines to count paper ballots and require states to conduct risk-limiting audits of all federal elections in order to detect any cyber hacks.\"[245] During her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office[246] and prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably U-Haul, Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the Cosco Busan oil spill. She also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.[247] In October 2017, Harris was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt questioning Pruitt's decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan, asserting that the repeal's proposal used \"mathematical sleights of hand to over-state the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized\" and science denying and math fabricating would fail to \"satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing.\"[248] In September 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sponsor the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, a bill described by cosponsor Elizabeth Warren as using \"market forces to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy\u00a0\u2013 reducing the odds of an environmental and financial disaster without spending a dime of taxpayer money.\"[249] She stated that her goal would be achieving 100% of U.S. electricity from renewable energy sources, and that she supports a Green New Deal, an idea made popular by first term Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, because \"climate change is an existential threat to all of us.\"[250] In November 2018, Harris was one of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution specifying key findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action toward addressing climate change.[251] On July 29, 2019, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez introduced the Climate Equity Act, a bill that would lay out steps for Congress and the White House on how to go about guaranteeing policies that composed \"a future Green New Deal protect the health and economic wellbeing of all Americans for generations to come.\" Referring to climate change as \"an existential threat\", Harris noted cutting emissions and ending American reliance on fossil fuels were not enough and cited the need \"that communities already contending with unsafe drinking water, toxic air, and lack of economic opportunity are not left behind.\"[252] On September 4, 2019, Harris unveiled a $10 trillion climate change plan intended to move the United States to a 100 percent renewable energy-based power grid by 2030 in addition to transitioning all vehicles in America to the same energy sources by 2035. She pledged to rejoin the Paris Agreement and end U.S. support for international oil and natural gas extraction projects, furthering that as president she would \"hold polluters accountable for the damage they inflict upon our environment and set us on a path to a 100 percent clean economy that creates millions of good-paying jobs.\"[253] In April 2017, responding to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Harris charged Syrian president Bashar al-Assad with attacking Syrian children, and stated \"the clear fact that president Assad is not only a ruthless dictator brutalizing his own people \u2013 he is a war criminal the international community cannot ignore.\" She called on President Trump to work with Congress on his administration's \"lack of clear objectives in Syria and articulate a detailed strategy and path forward in partnership with our allies.\"[254] In 2017, Harris gave a public address to AIPAC attendees. She said: \"I believe Israel should never be a partisan issue, and as long as I'm a United States senator, I will do everything in my power to ensure broad and bipartisan support for Israel's security and right to self-defense.\"[255] She has opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel.[256] She was a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[257][258][256] At the AIPAC conference, she said that \"the first resolution I co-sponsored as a United States senator was to combat anti-Israel bias at the United Nations\".[257] She also supported a Senate resolution celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.[259][260] In late 2017, she traveled to Israel, where she met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[257] In October 2017, Harris condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[261] In February 2018, Harris was one of 18 Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump stating that he lacked the authority to launch a preemptive strike against North Korea without authorization from Congress. The letter stated: \"Without congressional authority, a preventative or preemptive U.S. military strike would lack either a constitutional basis or legal authority.\"[262] In 2018, after Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Harris released a statement saying the decision \"jeopardizes our national security and isolates us from our closest allies\" while calling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \"the best existing tool we have to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and avoid a disastrous military conflict in the Middle East.\"[263] In late 2018, she voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. She also backed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul.[264] Harris supported the Iran nuclear deal to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.[256] In December 2018, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, she was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration \"now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries\" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.[265] Harris voted in favor of a $675 billion defense budget bill for 2019.[266] She said that North Korea is \"one of the most serious security threats\".[267] In February 2019, after former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe claimed that President Trump believed the claims of President of Russia Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies' reports on the subject of North Korea's missile capabilities, she told reporters, \"The idea that the president of the U.S. would take the word of the head of Russia over the intel community is the height of irresponsibility and shameful.\"[268] In an August 2019 interview with the Council on Foreign Relations, when asked if she as president would sign an agreement with North Korea granting partial sanctions relief in exchange for some denuclearization, Harris replied that President Trump had given \"Kim one PR victory after the next, all without securing any real concessions\" and that she would \"consider targeted sanctions relief to improve the lives of the North Korean people if the regime were to take serious, verifiable steps to roll back its nuclear program.\"[269] Harris criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which critics say gave Turkey the green light to launch the military offensive against Syrian Kurds.[270] Harris earned an \"F\" rating from the National Rifle Association for her consistent efforts supporting gun control.[271] While serving as district attorney in San Francisco Harris, along with other district attorneys, filed an amicus brief in District of Columbia v. Heller arguing that the Washington, D.C. gun law at issue did not violate the Second Amendment.[272] In her second term as district attorney, she said that getting guns off the streets was a priority.[273] During her run for Senate, Harris was endorsed by former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, who had been shot in Tucson in 2011. She was also endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.[274] In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Harris supported the call for more gun control. Saying that she believed that thoughts and prayers are inadequate answers to the shooting, she stated that \"...we must also commit ourselves to action. Another moment of silence won't suffice.\"[275][276] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer in August 2019, Harris stated that congressional action on gun control rested in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and that she \"would hope and pray that he understands that he actually has the power to do the right thing here and that he will do the right thing.\"[277] On August 14, 2019, Harris unveiled a plan that would address domestic terrorism while prioritizing increasing the difficulty for suspected individuals to either obtain or keep firearms through the formation of domestic terrorism prevention orders meant to empower law enforcement officers and family members with the ability to petition federal court for a temporary restriction on a person's access to firearms in the event that they \"exhibit clear evidence of dangerousness.\" Harris stated that in the US \"loaded guns should not be a few clicks away for any domestic terrorist with a laptop or smartphone\u201d and cited the \"need to take action to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and stop violent, hate-fueled attacks before they happen.\"[278] Harris owns a gun for \"personal safety\", as she was a career prosecutor.[279] On August 30, 2017, Harris announced at a town hall in Oakland that she would co-sponsor fellow Senator Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" bill, supporting single-payer healthcare.[280][215] In April 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sponsor the Choose Medicare Act, an expanded public option for health insurance that also increased ObamaCare subsidies and rendered individuals with higher income levels eligible for its assistance.[281] In December 2018, Harris was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \"increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\" The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress.\"[282] On July 29, 2019, Harris unveiled a health plan that would expand coverage while preserving a role for private insurance companies, the plan calling for transitioning to a Medicare for All system over a period of ten years that would be concurrent with infants and the uninsured automatically being placed into the system while other individuals would have the option to buy into the health care plan backed by the government.[283] The plan has been met with some criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.[284] Harris has expressed support for San Francisco's sanctuary city policy of not inquiring about immigration status in the process of a criminal investigation.[285] She argued that it is important that immigrants be able to talk with law enforcement without fear.[286] On October 25, 2017, Harris stated she would not support a spending bill until Congress addressed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in a way that clarified \"what we are going to do to protect and take care of our DACA young people in this country.\"[287] She did not support a February 2018 proposal by some Democrats to provide President Trump with $25 billion in funding for a border wall in exchange for giving DREAMers a pathway to citizenship.[288] In a January 2018 interview, when asked by Hiram Soto about her ideal version of a bipartisan deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Harris stated the need to focus on comprehensive immigration reform and \"pass a clean DREAM Act.\"[289] In January 2018, Harris and three other Democratic senators were cosponsors of the Border and Port Security Act, legislation that would mandate U.S. Customs and Border Protection \"hire, train and assign at least 500 officers per year until the number of needed positions the model identifies is filled\" in addition to requiring the commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection to determine potential equipment and infrastructure improvements that could be used for ports of entry.[290] In April 2018, Harris was one of five senators to send a letter to acting director of ICE Thomas Homan on standards used by the agency when determining how to detain a pregnant woman, requesting that pregnant women not be held in custody unless under extraordinary standards after reports \"that ICE has failed to provide critical medical care to pregnant women in immigration detention\u00a0\u2013 resulting in miscarriages and other negative health outcomes\".[291] In July 2018, the Trump administration falsely accused Harris of \"supporting the animals of MS-13.\"[292][293] She responded, \"As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.\"[292] In July 2018, Harris was one of 22 senators to sponsor the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act, which if enacted would prohibit immigration officers from detaining pregnant women in a majority of circumstances and improve conditions of care for individuals in custody.[294] In August 2018, Harris led fifteen Democrats and Bernie Sanders in a letter to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying \"trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.\"[295] In November 2018, Harris was one of eleven senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis concerning \"the overt politicization of the military\" with the Trump administration's deployment of 5,800 troops to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, and requesting a briefing and written justification from the U.S. Northern Command for troop deployment, while urging Mattis to \"curb the unprecedented escalation of DOD involvement in immigration enforcement.\"[296] In January 2019, Harris was one of twenty senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill imposing a ban on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from passing information collected on DACA recipients to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Justice, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies being investigated.[297] In June 2019, following the Housing and Urban Development Department's confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federal backed loans, Harris and eleven other senators introduced The Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to the immigration status of an applicant.[298] In July 2019, along with Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar, Harris sent a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement asserting that the agency \"should be prioritizing reunification of every child as soon as possible, but instead it has been responsible for policies that are forcing longer stays in government custody for children\" and that it was mandatory that the office \"ensure that the custody and processing of [unaccompanied migrant children] is meeting the minimum standards required by domestic and international law.\"[299] In July 2019, Harris and fifteen other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor ahead of engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations with the exception of special circumstances and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to report annually regarding enforcement actions in those locations.[300] In August 2019, after the Trump administration released a new regulation imposing the possibility that any green card and visa applicants could be turned down in the event they have low incomes or little education and have used benefits such as food stamps and housing vouchers at some point, Harris referred to the regulation as part of President Trump's ongoing campaign \"to vilify a whole group of people\" and cited Trump's sending of service members to the southern border and building a border wall as part of his goal to distract \"from the fact that he has betrayed so many people and has actually done very little that has been productive in the best interest of American families.\"[301] During her tenure as California Attorney General, Harris declined to defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage in court. She supported the Obama administration's guidance supporting transgender students. Following the Supreme Court's overturning of the ban on same-sex marriage, she proceeded to conduct California's first same-sex marriage.[302] Later on in 2015, she argued in court to withhold gender reassignment surgery from two transgender inmates who were prescribed the procedure while serving the sentences. This stance disappointed some LGBT rights advocates; she later stated that she only took that stance in court because her job required her to do so.[303] As a member of the U.S. Senate, she co-sponsored the Equality Act.[303] On October 7, 2019, Harris unveiled a six months paid family and medical leave plan that included forming a new Office of Paid Family and Medical Leave that would oversee, determine eligibility and authorize benefit payments. Harris's paid leave program would be funded through general revenue and payroll contributions and establish a federal Bureau of Children and Family Justice. In a statement, Harris said the US will be brought \"closer to economic justice for workers and ensures newborn children or children who are sick can get the care they need from a parent without thrusting the family into upheaval\" via a six-month paid leave guarantee.[304] In September 2017, Harris was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai that charged the FCC with failing \"to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to comment on the tens of thousands of filed complaints that directly shed light on proposed changes to existing net neutrality protections.\"[305] In March 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Jeff Merkley lambasting a proposal from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai that would curb the scope of benefits from the Lifeline program during a period where roughly 6.5 million people in poor communities relied on Lifeline to receive access to high-speed internet, citing that it was Pai's \"obligation to the American public, as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to improve the Lifeline program and ensure that more Americans can afford access, and have means of access, to broadband and phone service.\" The senators also advocated for insuring \"Lifeline reaches more Americans in need of access to communication services.\"[306] In a September 2019 letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Harris called for the creation of a task force to investigate allegations against Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and look into whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress during his testimony the previous year as a Supreme Court nominee.[307] In October 2019, when asked whether she thought a president undergoing impeachment inquiries should be authorized to nominate Supreme Court justices, Harris replied, \"That's a great question. I think he should be put on a timeout across the board.\"[308] Harris opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and has called for a repeal of the bill's tax cuts for wealthy Americans.[309] In 2018, she proposed a tax cut for the majority of working- and middle-class Americans. An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would reduce federal revenue by $2.8 trillion over a decade. She proposed to pay for the tax cuts by repealing tax cuts for wealthy Americans and by increasing taxes on corporations.[216][309][310] In May 2019, Harris stated she would not have voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) due to her belief that \"we can do a better job to protect American workers\" and called for the United States to do \"a better job in terms of thinking about the priorities that should be more apparent now than perhaps they were then, which are issues like the climate crisis and what we need to build into these trade agreements.\"[311] In May 2019, Harris attributed the 2018 gubernatorial losses of Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, in both Georgia and Florida to voter suppression.[312] Harris is married to California attorney Douglas Emhoff,[313] who was at one time partner-in-charge at Venable LLP's Los Angeles office.[314] Emhoff is Jewish.[315] They married on August 22, 2014, in Santa Barbara, California.[313] The couple do not have children together, but Harris is stepmother to Cole and Ella, Emhoff's two children from his previous marriage.[316][317][318] Her sister is Maya Harris, an MSNBC political analyst, and her brother-in-law is Tony West, general counsel of Uber and a former United States Department of Justice senior official.[8][9] From 1994 to 1995, Harris dated then-California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown.[35][36][37] Brown is 30 years older than Harris and was separated from his wife during their relationship.[17] Harris has said that she met Brown because their social circles overlapped: \"Black people who go to college have about two degrees of separation with other black professionals, and those who go to law school have even less. The networks of black lawyers in California are small\".[17] Harris ended the relationship.[17] Harris has received honorary degrees from Howard University and from the University of Southern California.[319][320] Harris is a Baptist.[321] The Washington Post reported the 2018 income of Harris and Emhoff as $1.9 million.[322][323][324] As of August 2019, Harris and her husband have a net worth of $5.8 million.[325] They own homes in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San Francisco.[325] Harris has written two non-fiction books and one children's book.[326][327] She also wrote the entry for Christine Blasey Ford when Ford was named one of the Time 100 people in 2019.[328]",

A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the 27th District Attorney of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011 and 32nd Attorney General of California from 2011 until 2017. She ran as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 election, before dropping out on December 3, 2019.[2]\nHarris was born in Oakland, California, and is a graduate of Howard University and University of California, Hastings College of the Law. In the 1990s, she worked in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and the City Attorney of San Francisco's office. In 2004, she was elected District Attorney of San Francisco.\nHarris won the election as California's Attorney General in 2010 and was reelected in 2014 by a wide margin. On November 8, 2016, she defeated Loretta Sanchez in the 2016 Senate election to succeed outgoing Senator Barbara Boxer, becoming California's third female U.S. Senator, and the first of either Jamaican or  Indian ancestry.[3] Since becoming a Senator, she has supported single-payer healthcare, federal descheduling of cannabis, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the DREAM Act, a ban on assault rifles, and lowering the tax burden for the working and middle classes while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest one percent of Americans.\nKamala Devi Harris was born on October 20, 1964 in Oakland, California. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a Tamil Indian breast-cancer scientist who immigrated to the United States from Madras, India, in 1960 to pursue a doctorate in endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley).[4][5] Her father, Donald Harris, is a Stanford University economics professor who emigrated from Jamaica in 1961 for graduate study in economics at UC Berkeley.[6][7] Harris has one younger sister, Maya Harris.[8][9] Her mother chose to give them both Sanskrit names derived from Hindu mythology to help preserve their cultural identity.[10] She is also a descendant of a slave owner from Jamaica.[11]\nShe identifies as black[12] and Indian, but sees her experience primarily as American.[13] Harris was raised in Berkeley, California.[14] She grew up attending both a Black Baptist church, where she and her sister sang in the choir, and a Hindu temple.[15][16]\nHer mother was an upper class Brahmin[17] from the Besant Nagar neighborhood of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, whose \"Gopalan\" bloodline can be traced over 1,000 years.[18] Shyamala was described as a \"feminist concerned that the women who did her laundry were the victims of domestic violence.\"[17] As a child, Harris used to visit her extended family in Chennai and was reportedly quite close to her maternal grandfather P. V. Gopalan, who was an Indian diplomat.[5][19]\nHarris began kindergarten during the second year of Berkeley's school desegregation busing program, which adopted the extensive use of busing to attempt to bring racial balance to each of the city's public schools; a bus drove her to a school which, two years prior, had been 95% white.[20][21]\nHarris' parents divorced when she was seven, and her mother was granted custody of Harris and her sister.[14][11] After the divorce, when she and her sister would visit their father in Palo Alto on the weekends, she stated that neighbors' kids were not allowed to play with them because they were black.[15]\nWhen Harris was 12, she and her sister moved with their mother to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where she had accepted a position doing research at Jewish General Hospital and teaching at McGill University.[22][23][24] She was a popular student at Westmount High School in Westmount, Quebec.[25] As a teenager, Harris co-founded a small dance troupe of six dancers that played at community centres and fundraisers.[26]\nHarris graduated from high school in 1981.[27][28] She went on to Howard University in Washington, D.C. where she double-majored in political science and economics, was elected to the liberal-arts student council, was on the debate team, organized mentor programs for local youth, demonstrated against apartheid, and joined Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.[29][30][29][17]\nHarris returned to California, where in 1989 she earned her Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.[7][31]  She was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1990.  Believing the world needed \"more socially aware prosecutors,\"[17] Harris decided to seek a career in law enforcement because she wanted to be \"at the table where decisions are made\".[7][32]\nIn 1990, Harris was hired as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California where she was noted as being \"an able prosecutor on the way up.\"[33]  She specialized in child sexual abuse trials, which she observed were a difficult type of prosecution, given juries are more inclined to accept the word of an adult over the word of a child.[17]\n\"Harris has a good courtroom presence, a high success rate. She is a genuinely good person and her social values will work well in San Francisco.\"[17]  \u2013\u2013 Tom Orloff, Alameda District Attorney\nDuring this time, Harris also taught advocacy skills at Stanford and University of San Francisco.[34]\nHarris dated then-California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown from 1994 to 1995.[35][36][37] Brown began introducing Harris to his political network, resulting in Harris being increasingly featured in local newspapers and society columns. According to Jack Davis, the manager of Brown's campaign for mayor of San Francisco, \"'Brown [was] the darling of the well-to-do set... And she was the girlfriend, and so she met, you know, everybody who\u2019s anybody, as a result of being his girl.'\"[37]\nIn 1994, Harris took leave of her position in Alameda County when Brown appointed her to the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board.[38][34][37]  The position paid $100,000 per year.[35] Harris served on the board for six months.  Then, during a lame-duck session, Brown appointed her to a three-year term on the California Medical Assistance Commission, overseeing Medi-Cal service contracts.[39][40]  The Commission reportedly met about once per month and paid commission members over $70,000 per year.[38][39][34][17] Regarding these patronage positions, Harris has said:\n\"These jobs were created before I was born.  Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work. I worked hard to keep St. Luke's Hospital open. I brought a level of life knowledge and common sense to the jobs. I mean, if you were asked to be on a board that regulated medical care, would you say no?\u201d[17]\nHarris ended her relationship with Brown shortly after his mayoral inauguration.[17] In 2003, she expressed frustration at being linked to Brown in the media; referring to him as an \"albatross hanging around my neck,\" she said, \"I have no doubt that I am independent of him\u2013\u2013and that he would probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.  His career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.\"[17] In 2015, she referred to Brown as \"a mentor and friend.\"[15]\nIn February 1998, San Francisco District Attorney, Terence Hallinan, appointed Harris as an Assistant District Attorney.[41]  She became the chief of the Career Criminal Division, supervising five other attorneys,[17] where she prosecuted homicide, burglary, robbery and sexual assault cases \u2013\u2013 particularly Three-Strikes cases.[17]  Harris was noted as having been \"an excellent mentor\" in the office, and had been active in Hallinan's 1999 re-election campaign through his December election.  However, eight months later, Harris quit.[33][42]\n\nHarris reportedly clashed with Hallinan's new chief assistant, Darrell Salomon \u2013\u2013 a former personal attorney to Senator Dianne Feinstein with connections to City Hall, but no criminal prosecuting experience.[33][43] Salomon was appointed in January after the previous chief, Richard Iglehart, was appointed to become a Superior Court Judge.[44]Salomon's appointment coincided with the introduction of a state ballot measure \u2013\u2013 Prop 21 \u2013\u2013 which would be voted on in an election held in three months.[42]  The proposition would grant prosecutors the option of trying juvenile defendants in Superior Court rather than juvenile courts.  This authority was usually only granted to judges and could have had a big impact in San Francisco where drug violations accounted for nearly 70% of prosecuted crimes.[42]\nHarris opposed the measure, as did Hallinan, who was the only District Attorney in the state to oppose the measure.[42]  However, Harris, concerned about the possibility of nearly 40,000 kids per year \u2013\u2013 mostly minority \u2013\u2013 being tried in adult court, became very involved in campaigning against the measure, including attending rallies as a speaker, writing position papers and volunteering for the \"No-On-21\" campaign on weekends.[42]  Her knowledge and commitment to the issue was such that the District Attorney's Public Information Officer at the time, Fred Gardner, would give reporters the option to interview both Harris and Hallinan.  However, doing so reportedly made Hallinan suspicious that Harris was trying to usurp him in preparation of challenging him for the next election (in 2003).[42]  Salomon approached Gardner and allegedly accused him of helping Harris: \"You're trying to make a star out of Kamala Harris.\"[42] Gardner dismissed the accusation, noting that \"she [Harris] is already a star,\" and was then reportedly told by Salomon to stop directing Prop 21 media inquiries to Harris as he believed Harris had \"an agenda\" given she was \"Willie Brown's protege.\"[42]\nGardner confronted Harris and inquired if she was planning to run in 2003. She reportedly replied that it would be \"unprofessional\" to run against Hallinan if he decided to run for a third term.[42] Gardner relayed Harris' response to Hallinan.  However, Gardner stated that Hallinan \"did not believe her.\"[42]  Hallinan then ordered that all calls from reporters, not only those pertaining to Prop 21, go directly to him: \"I'm the elected official.  I'm the D.A. It's my office. Except for my spokesman, I don't want anybody going to the media.\"[42]\nHallinan then reassigned Harris, which Harris believed to be a de facto demotion, and set a canary trap to test her loyalty by divulging supposedly confidential information to her and watching to see if was leaked to the media.[42]  It was, but the leaker turned out to be Hallinan himself, not Harris.[42]\nShortly after her reassignment, Harris was a part of a group of supervisors who confronted Hallinan about Salomon, seeking to \"overthrow\" him.[17] However, when their attempt failed, Harris then filed a complaint against Salomon and quit.[33][17]\nThe spokesman for the District Attorney's office called Harris' defection \"a sad day [because Harris was] a good lawyer, well-liked and brilliant.\"[33]\nSalomon resigned two weeks after Harris left.[43]  He reportedly blamed Harris for \"stirring up resentment towards him.\"[42]\nIn August 2000, Harris took a new job at San Francisco City Hall, working for elected City Attorney, Louise Renne.[33] Renne hired Harris to take the place of Katherine Feinstein, after Feinstein was appointed as a Superior Court Judge.[33][45][33]  Harris ran the Family and Children's Services Division representing child abuse and neglect cases, domestic violence, building code enforcement, and public health matters.[17][33]  Renne said of Harris:\n\"She will make the best DA this city has seen in years.\"[17]\nHarris was reportedly so angry about the discontent in Terence Hallinan's office that she decided to run against him.[17]  She began \"methodically gathering support\" by attending political events, volunteering on other campaigns, assuming board memberships on nonprofits, being seen at exclusive parties, and presenting herself as an alternative to a \"political has-been.\"[17]\nIn mid-2002, Harris called Mark Buell, the stepfather of her friend, Summer Tompkins Walker, and told him of her intention to run for District Attorney against the two-term incumbent \u2013\u2013 and her former boss.[37]  Buell was married to major Democratic megadonor, Susie Tompkins Buell.  He was doubtful of Harris' candidacy as he had only thought of her as \"a socialite with a law degree\"  However, Buell, impressed by Harris, offered to be her finance chair.[37]\nBuell advised that to beat an incumbent, Harris would need to raise more than $150,000, the highest amount ever raised to campaign for the position.  He and Harris organized a finance committee composed mostly of Harris' friends, who were \"young socialite ladies\".[37]  The committee included Vanessa Getty and Susan Swig.  While Harris, saying that the black community was \"her base\",[17] set up her campaign office in Bayview \u2013\u2013 the \"most isolated neighborhood\" in San Francisco[37] \u2013\u2013 the committee arranged for her to \"routinely\" raise money in the exclusive neighborhood of Pacific Heights, with 25% of her donations coming from Pacific Heights alone:\n\"The crowd seems fascinated by Harris, an intelligent woman of color who speaks their language, who knows their first names, and who understands that as liberals, they want to maintain law and order \u2013\u2013 but with a certain San Francisco\u00adstyle noblesse oblige.\"[17]\nHarris was also seeking to run a campaign that disrupted negative stereotypes of black women:[17]\n\u201c...Black female candidates have to fight the perception that black women are not competent. When whites look at black women they see [them] as servants, maids or cooks...Being able to cross over into the white community is essential for any black, female or male, to succeed as a political figure. [They should] lay the groundwork by looking to become active on the boards of social, cultural and, charitable institutions like symphonies, museums, and hospitals. It\u2019s the way to get respect from a world that otherwise is content to eschew or label you.\"[46] \u2013\u2013 Willie Brown\nWhen Harris announced her candidacy, she had served on the board of trustees of the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco, had been a member of San Francisco Jazz Organization, was a patron dinner chair for the San Francisco Symphony's Black &amp; White Ball, was the executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, led the board of directors of Partners Ending Domestic Abuse, and was a board member of nonprofit, Women Count. Harris was also documented attending exclusive events, dressing in luxury clothing such as Burberry, and dining with the heirs of billionaires:[37]\n\"...people wanted to be able to say they\u2019d met her and were supporting her because of this quasi-social network that we started with, and the more she raised, and the more she got traction, the more everybody else wanted to say they heard her, they talked to her and were supportive...but they were kind of professional socialites, and they wanted to help her. They saw it as a two-way street.\"[37] \u2013\u2013 Sharon Owsley, Socialite and Attorney\nIn 2003, Harris entered the election, running against two-term incumbent and former boss, Terence Hallinan, and defense attorney, Bill Fazio.[47][48]  Harris was the least known candidate among the three, but noted to be \"whip-smart, hard-working, and well-credentialed.\"[48][17]\nHallinan and Fazio sought to link Harris to Willie Brown, who was openly campaigning and fundraising for Harris, through a PAC \u2013\u2013 California Voter Project \u2013\u2013 though reportedly without her consent.[17]  Harris denied financially benefitting from Brown.  However, Mark Buell later admitted that he met with Brown for lunch and Brown volunteered a campaign tactic to him.[17]  Buell also admitted that Brown personally donated $500 \u2013\u2013 the individual donation maximum \u2013\u2013 to Harris after Summer Tompkins Walker reportedly asked Brown to donate while at a restaurant.[17]\n\"How can Harris root out corruption if she has Willie supporting her behind the scenes?  I do not care that they had a relationship, but there are legitimate questions whether or not there is payback there.\"[17] \u2013\u2013 Bill Fazio\nHowever, Harris supporters said that statements used to tie her to Willie Brown were misogynistic. Harris' sister, Maya, asked: \u201cWhen a woman dates an accomplished man, why are people so willing to assume it's only because of him that the woman is successful?\" [17]  Harris' mother stated:\n\"What has Willie Brown done for her?  Introduce her to society people when they dated?  If they did not like Kamala on her own right, they would have dropped her after she dropped Willie.  Kamala is comfortable in all kinds of social scenes.  She can pull it off in high society, too. She has the manners, the eating habits.\"[17]\nHarris' campaign later successfully lobbied the 24-member Central Committee \u2013\u2013 including U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and then-House Majority leader Nancy Pelosi  \u2013\u2013 of the statewide Democratic party to deny their influential endorsement to either of Harris' competitors.[17]  It was the first time the Central Committee had withheld its endorsement from an incumbent.\nHarris was found to be guilty, by the city's Ethics Commission, of violating campaign spending limit of $211,000, of which Harris had agreed to abide by before the campaign commenced.[48]  Harris had overspent the pledged amount by nearly $100,000.  The Commission's own staff was later accused of abusing its discretion, and favoring Harris, when it retroactively lifted the campaign spending limit after Harris' campaign had spent over the limit, and when Harris' campaign said that it was recognizing the Commission as the authority of the limit's forms rather than the Department of Elections.[48]  The Commission denied the accusations, saying that its staff acted with its authority under local law.[48]\nHarris' supporters said her campaign mistakenly violated the spending cap due to a \"misinterpretation of confusing law changes\" on the forms.[48] They also argued that the cap put lesser-known candidates at a disadvantage, which was unfair since Harris had to spend more to increase her profile.  However, critics charged that the forms were straightforward for any attorney to understand.  Critics were also adamant that Harris willfully violated the spending cap and argued that, even if Harris mistakenly overspent the cap, that doing so was indefensible under the law.[48]\nHarris ran a \"Notice to Voters\" in newspapers stating that she never agreed to limit her campaign spending, but said her failure to file the form (to decline the campaign spending cap) on time on was \"due to errors by her campaign.\"[49]  Harris' campaign lawyer also argued that the spending cap violated the First Amendment.  Harris' campaign was questioned on why she would agree to the spending limit if it was, in fact, unconstitutional.  Harris' campaign responded that political candidates face political pressure \"to accept rules that hinder their constitutional rights.\"[48]\nHarris was fined nearly $35,000 by the Commission and ordered to alert voters, in her mailers, that she had violated the spending limit.  The mailers, subsequently produced by her campaign, were said to have displayed her spending violation with \"the smallest font in America.\"[48]\nHarris, who the San Francisco Examiner called \"a relative unknown\", went on to spend nearly $625,000 throughout the campaign while Hallinan spent just over $285,000.[50]  It was more than four times more than any candidate had raised in the history of running for the office.[37]\nHarris garnered negative press from the campaign spending violation, but was said to have run a \"forceful\" campaign, assisted with the political and personal backing of former boyfriend, mayor Willie Brown, and connections to the city's high society.[50][37] Harris secured \"an impressive array\" of endorsements, including from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Sheriff Michael Hennessey, writer and cartoonist Aaron McGruder (who Harris noted was a close friend), and comedians Eddie Griffin and Chris Rock.[50][51][52]\nBill Fazio had been eliminated from the election after initial voting. Hallinan and Harris, who garnered 37% and 33% of the vote, respectively, would have a runoff.[53]\nIn the runoff, Harris sought to differentiate her policy positions from those of Hallinan, as it was a \"problem\" that they ideologically agreed on key issues such as being against the use of the death penalty.[17]  Harris ran on making the sexual abuse of children her top issue.[54]  She charged that, though she worked for Hallinan for two years, she left his office because it was \"dysfunctional,\" technologically inept and was \"a mess.\"  She attacked Hallinan for promoting people in his office without merit, for his \"abysmal\" conviction rate for serious crimes (at just under 65%) \u2013\u2013 over 10 percent lower than his predecessor's rate \u2013\u2013 lowering office morale, and for his willingness to accept plea bargains in cases of domestic violence:[50][54][17]\n\"It is not progressive to be soft on crime.\"[17] \u2013\u2013 Kamala Harris, 2003\nHallinan refuted that Harris was misrepresenting his office.  For example, he stated the decrease in conviction rate was not due to the performance of his office, but because of a diversion program that he created for criminals.[17]\nHarris was lauded for her campaigning skills, particularly for \"listen[ing] carefully to the concerns of ordinary people.\"[17]  She was rumored to have worked 16 hours per day on her campaign, but was charged by critics as being a \"machine\" candidate more concerned with conviction rates than the people who were actually convicted:[54][17]\n\"It's not the tradition in San Francisco to favor punishment over rehabilitation. We are not concerned with the conviction rate, we don't want to come down hard on people accused of crimes, we don't want to nail them to the cross.\u201d[17] \u2013\u2013 Jeff Adachi, Public Defender, 2003\nHarris also accrued negative publicity.  Being upper middle class she was portrayed as being out of touch with her self-described \"black base.\"[17]  She reportedly told a group of affluent blacks at Yerba Buena Gardens, along with affluent whites in Pacific Heights, \"The most victimized people do not vote, so you have to act on their behalf.\u201d[17]  Also, while talking to three black men, outside of a Sunnydale housing project, who planned to protest the Muni transit system for not honoring its promise to hire young blacks to work on a new light-rail system, Harris suggested they \"ask a police captain to conduct a protest training [so] you can protest safely.\"  The organizer of the protest, Harold Kyer, was reportedly embarrassed to have to explain to Harris that her suggestion was naive:\n\"Our community is not police-friendly, Ms. Harris.  They will not come to a meeting if the police show up.\"[17]\nHarris faced additional criticism.  Her support of Proposition M, which would increase criminal penalties for panhandling without providing funds for housing or health services for the homeless, conflicted with her liberal platform. However, the stance aligned her with Mayoral candidate, Gavin Newsom, whose campaign was supporting the initiative. Harris was also criticized, near the end of the campaign, for holding a press conference in which she vocalized a case about a woman who was tortured by her boyfriend with a hot iron, in order to attack Hallinan's record on domestic violence.[55]  Harris did not talk to, or consult with, the victim prior to citing the case.  However, Hallinan did speak with the victim and her family.  The victim subsequently praised Hallinan for \"respect[ing] her desire not to have the case become a media spectacle.\"  Harris was accused of politicizing the victim.[55]\nHarris won with 56.33% of the vote and became the first woman to lead the District Attorney's Office of San Francisco.[50]\nIn April 2004, San Francisco Police Department Officer Isaac Espinoza was shot and killed in the line of duty. Three days later, Harris announced she would not seek the death penalty, angering the San Francisco Police Officers Association. During Espinoza's funeral at St. Mary's Cathedral, U.S. Senator and former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein rose to the pulpit and called on Harris, who was sitting in the front pew, to secure the death penalty, prompting a standing ovation from the 2,000 uniformed police officers in attendance. Harris still refused. Espinoza's killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.[7]\nIn 2004, as district attorney, Harris started the Back On Track initiative, a reentry program.[7] Initiative participants (who are nonviolent, first-time drug offenders whose crimes were not weapon- or gang-related) plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a year-long period. Participants who succeed in obtaining a high-school-equivalency diploma, maintaining steady employment, taking parenting classes, and passing drug tests have their records cleared.[56][57] Over eight years, the program produced fewer than 300 graduates, but achieved a very low recidivism rate.[7] In 2009, a state law (the Back on Track Reentry Act, Assembly Bill 750) was enacted, encouraging other counties to start programs around a similar model. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill into law.[58][59] The program met some controversy because it initially included illegal immigrants, including one, Alexander Izaguirre, who was later arrested for assault.[60] She later said allowing persons not eligible to work in the United States was a mistake,[60] and modified the program to bar anyone who could not legally be employed in the United States.[61]\nHarris was re-elected in 2007 when she ran unopposed.[62] A 2008 New York Times article listing women who might have the potential to become president of the United States listed then-District Attorney Harris, suggesting she had a reputation as a \"tough fighter.\"[63]\nIn 2009, Harris's book Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer was published by Chronicle Books.[56] In the book, she touted her Back On Track initiative and argued for what she referred to as \"a smarter approach when it comes to combating nonviolent crime\" emphasizing crime prevention, truancy prevention, and the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in children.[56][57] The book discusses a series of \"myths\" surrounding the criminal justice system and presents proposals to reduce and prevent crime.[57] Recognized by The Los Angeles Daily Journal as one of the top 100 lawyers in California, she served on the board of the California District Attorneys Association and was vice president of the National District Attorneys Association.[64]\nIn 2013, the San Francisco Weekly reported that the San Francisco Police Department and Harris's office shielded Abraham H. Guerra Sr., a high-ranking member of the Norte\u00f1o gang, from returning to prison due to parole violations because Guerra was an informant who provided authorities with information.[65]\nWhile Harris was the San Francisco District Attorney, the overall felony conviction rate rose from 52% in 2003 to 67% in 2006, the highest in a decade; there was an 85% conviction rate for homicides, and convictions of drug dealers increased from 56% in 2003 to 74% in 2006.[66] In addition to trial convictions, she also closed many cases via plea bargains.\nWhen Harris took office, she cleared part of the murder caseload from the previous administration. She stated that the records from that administration were less than ideal, and worked to get convictions on what she could. Out of the 73 homicide cases backlogged, over 40% of them took deals for lesser charges, such as manslaughter, pleaded to other crimes, such as assault or burglary while the murder charges were dismissed.[67]\nIn 2004, Harris pushed for higher bail for criminal defendants involved in gun-related crimes. She argued that low bail encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco.\nOfficers within the SFPD credited Harris with tightening loopholes in bail and drug programs that defendants had used in the past. However, they also accused her of being too deliberate in her prosecution of murder suspects.[68]\nIn 2009, Harris' prosecutors won a lower percentage of their felony jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California.  Her at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76 percent, down 12 percent from the previous year, was more than 5 percent under the statewide average.[69]\nIn 2012, Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo ruled that Harris's office violated defendants' rights by hiding damaging information about a San Francisco Police Department crime lab technician, that Harris' office had ignored a constitutional obligation to turn over to defense attorneys the criminal histories of police testifying at trial, and that Harris' office was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings.[70][71]\nIn the 1970s, Joey Piscitelli was repeatedly raped by the principal of his Catholic High School, Father Stephen Whelan.[72] In 2004, he was pursuing a civil case against the church that oversaw his high school and seeking help to strengthen his case.\nPiscitelli had previously gone to the District Attorney's office when Terrance Hallinan was the D.A. and received the assistance he requested. Hallinan's office provided Piscitelli with access to files it had obtained in 2002 after Hallinan directed investigators to try to build a case against the archdiocese and forced the archdiocese to turn over 75 years of its own records.[72] The files implicated high-level church officials and detailed how they internally handled pedophile priests.[73][71]  The files had been successfully used to indict a priest, Father Austin Peter Keegan.[72]\nPiscitelli intended to use the files in a similar manner, seeking any information that could be helpful in his civil suit against the church that oversaw his high school. At the time, a civil trial was the only avenue for restitution available to victims following a Supreme Court decision overturning a California law that retroactively eliminated the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution of child molestation cases.[72]  Many sexual abusers who were facing criminal charges prior to the ruling were set free, including Keegan.[72][74] However, in 2003, California passed a state law that allowed victims to file civil lawsuits against their alleged abusers if they could prove that the employers of the abusers knew of the misconduct and did nothing to stop it.[72] Piscitelli's civil suit was already underway when he contacted Harris, shortly after she defeated Hallinan.\nPiscitelli says Harris's office did not respond to his letters or calls, and would not allow him to access the files. In response, Piscitelli and his family and friends began mounting posters across the city to force Harris to respond. He sought help from the media, which requested access to the files under California's Public Records Act, but Harris's deputy, Paul Henderson, denied the request, stating that Harris's investigative files \"were not subject to California's government transparency laws.\"[71] In 2005, when San Francisco Weekly writer Ron Russell attempted the request again, a Harris spokesperson told him:\n\"If we did it [granted access to files] for you, we would have to do it for everybody. Where do you stop, and where do you start?\"[71]\nRepeated attempts by reporters to access the files were similarly denied over the years, with Harris's spokesperson, Erica Derryck, not responding to calls or emails from reporters. Eventually, in 2010, Harris's office released a statement:\n\"District Attorney Harris focuses her efforts on putting child molesters in prison. We're not interested in selling out our victims to look good in the paper. When this case was brought under Terence Hallinan, prosecutors took the utmost care to protect the identity and dignity of the victims. That was the right thing to do then and it's the right thing to do now.\"[71]\nCritics charged that the statement was \"dangerous,\" as not exposing predators could endanger more children.[71] They argued that releasing such records was not only \"routine,\" but also cruel, in that it further burdened victims with having to resort to costly litigation if they wanted to obtain records that documented the crimes that happened against them.[71] Critics also charged that the statement implied that the district attorney's office was incapable of simply redacting victims' names from the released material.[71][72] They speculated that Harris, considering her political future, gave deference to the Catholic Church, noted to be a major political influence in San Francisco.[72]\nSupporters of Harris maintain she did the right thing in not releasing the documents:\n\"I don\u2019t think a district attorney should float that out there if a person can\u2019t defend themselves. It\u2019s a very serious charge, a sex crime.\"[72]  \u2013\u2013 Elliot Beckelman, Former San Francisco Assistant District Attorney\nIn 2006, Piscitelli won his civil case, doing so without the help of Harris's office.[75] During her seven years as District Attorney, Harris did not bring charges or proactively assist in civil cases against any sexual abusers in the church.[72] Critics charge that her failure to do so conflicts with her campaign promise to make the sexual abuse of children her top issue.[54][72]\nAs San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created a special Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools. She convened a national conference to confront the \"gay-transgender panic defense\", which has been used to justify violent hate crimes.[76] She supports same-sex marriage in California and opposed both Proposition 22 and Proposition 8.[77]\nIn 2004, The National Urban League honored Harris as a \"Woman of Power\". In 2005, she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association. In her campaign for California Attorney General, she received the endorsements of many groups including EMILY's List, California Legislative Black Caucus, Asian American Action Fund, Black Women Organized for Political Action, the National Women's Political Caucus, Mexican American Bar Association, and South Asians for Opportunity.[78]\nOn November 12, 2008, Harris announced her candidacy for California Attorney General. Both of California's United States Senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, endorsed her during the Democratic Party primary.[79] In the June 8, 2010, primary, she was nominated with 33.6% of the vote, defeating Alberto Torrico (who received 15.6% of the vote) and Chris Kelly (who received 15.5%).[80]\nIn her campaign for California Attorney General, Harris received the endorsements of United Farm Workers cofounder Dolores Huerta, United Educators of San Francisco, and San Francisco Firefighters Local 798.[78] She also received the endorsement of Antonio Villaraigosa, Mayor of Los Angeles.[81] In the general election, she faced Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley. On election night, November 2, 2010, Cooley prematurely declared victory, but many ballots remained uncounted. On November 24, as the count advanced, Harris was leading by more than 55,000 votes, and Cooley conceded.[82] On January 3, 2011, she became the first female,[64] Jamaican-American,[81][83] and Indian-American attorney general in California.[84][85]\nHarris announced her intention to run for re-election in February 2014 and filed paperwork to run on February 12. According to the office of California Secretary of State Debra Bowen, Harris had raised the money for her campaign during the previous year in 2013.[86] The Sacramento Bee,[87] Los Angeles Daily News,[88] and Los Angeles Times endorsed her for reelection.[89]\nOn November 4, 2014, Harris was re-elected against Republican Ronald Gold.[90]\nIn 2012, Harris participated in the National Mortgage Settlement against five banks, securing $12 billion of debt reduction for the state's homeowners and $26 billion overall.[91][92]\nShe introduced the California Homeowner's Bill of Rights in the California State Legislature, a set of laws which took effect on January 1, 2013, banning the practices of \"dual-tracking\" (processing a modification and foreclosure at the same time) and robo-signing, and provided homeowners with a single point of contact at their lending institution. It also gave the California Attorney General more power to investigate and prosecute financial fraud and to convene special grand juries to prosecute multi-county crimes instead of prosecuting a single crime county by county.[93][94]\nAfter the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Plata (2011) declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted cruel and unusual punishment, Harris fought federal court supervision, explaining \"I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client.\"[7] After California failed to fully implement the court's order to reduce crowding, and was ordered to implement new parole programs, the State of California appealed the decision, and in court filings the AG's office argued that if forced to release these inmates early, prisons would lose an important source of labor,[95] such as for fighting wildfires.[96] Prisoners in California earn between 8 and 37 cents per hour in maintenance and kitchen jobs;[95] prisoner firefighters receive higher pay, at $1 per hour.[96] She later backed away from her office's argument in the prison-litigation case, telling the website ThinkProgress: \"The way that argument played out in court does not reflect my priorities... The idea that we incarcerate people to have indentured servants is one of the worst possible perceptions. I feel very strongly about that. It evokes images of chain gangs.\"[96][97]\nIn 2017, she introduced legislation to \"reform or replace the practice of money bail.\"[98]\nHarris refused to take any position on criminal sentencing-reform initiatives Proposition 36 (2012) and Proposition 47 (2014), arguing it would be improper because her office prepares the ballot booklets.[7] Former California Attorney General John Van de Kamp considered her explanation \"baloney.\"[7]\nHarris has prosecuted many financial crimes, such as predatory lending.[99] In 2011, while serving as Attorney General of California, she created the Mortgage Fraud Strike Force which had a mandate to eliminate mortgage foreclosure fraud. The task force has been criticized for not filing as many foreclosure cases as in states with smaller populations.[100]\nIn 2013, Harris did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin's bank OneWest despite evidence \"suggestive of widespread misconduct\" according to a leaked memo from the Department of Justice.[101][102] In 2017, she said that her office's decision not to prosecute Mnuchin was based on \"following the facts and the evidence...like any other case\".[103] In 2016, Mnuchin donated $2,000 to her campaign,[104] making her the only 2016 Senate Democratic candidate to get cash from Mnuchin,[105] but as senator, she voted against the confirmation of Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury.[105][106]\nIn 2012, Harris sent a letter to 100 mobile-app developers, asking them to comply with California law with respect to privacy issues.[107] If any developer of an application that could be used by a Californian does not display a privacy policy statement when the application is installed, California law is broken, with a possible fine of $2500 for every download. The law affects any developer anywhere in the world if the app is used by a Californian.[108]\nIn February 2014, Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, a transgender woman incarcerated at California's Mule Creek State Prison, filed a federal lawsuit based on the state's failure to provide her with what she argued was medically necessary sex reassignment surgery (SRS).[109] In April 2015, a federal judge ordered the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to provide Norsworthy with SRS, finding that prison officials had been \"deliberately indifferent to her serious medical need.\"[110][111] Harris, representing CDCR, challenged the order in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.[112] She argued that \"Norsworthy has been receiving hormone therapy for her gender dysphoria since 2000, and continues to receive hormone therapy and other forms of treatment\" and that \"there is no evidence that Norsworthy is in serious, immediate physical or emotional danger.\"[113]\nIn August 2015, while the state's appeal was pending, Norsworthy was released on parole, obviating the state's duty to provide her with inmate medical care[114] and rendering the case moot.[115] Harris maintained that the parole review process was independent of Norsworthy's legal case against CDCR, although the Ninth Circuit, in its opinion, said it was possible that Norsworthy's release on parole, ahead of her scheduled SRS, may have been influenced by CDCR officials.[115]\nOn February 12, 2015, Harris announced that she would start a new agency called the Bureau of Children's Justice. The bureau would work on issues such as foster care, the juvenile justice system, school truancy, and childhood trauma. She appointed special assistant attorney general Jill Habig to head the agency.[116]\nIn 2015, Harris defended convictions obtained by county prosecutors who had inserted a false confession into an interrogation transcript, committed perjury, and withheld evidence.[7] Federal appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski threw out the convictions, telling lawyers, \"Talk to the attorney general and make sure she understands the gravity of the situation.\"[7]\nIn March 2015, a California superior courts judge ordered Harris to take over a criminal case after Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas was revealed to have illegally employed jailhouse informants and concealed evidence.[7] She refused, appealing the order and defending Rackauckas.[7]\nHarris appealed the dismissal of an indictment when it was discovered a Kern County prosecutor perjured in submitting a falsified confession as court evidence. In the case, she argued that only abject physical brutality would warrant a finding of prosecutorial misconduct and the dismissal of an indictment, and that perjury alone was not enough.[117][118]\nAfter an oil spill from a pipeline caused damage to the California coastline in May 2015, Harris toured the coastline and directed her office's resources and attorneys to investigate possible criminal violations.[119] The investigations led to dozens of indictments.[120] In June 2016, she issued subpoenas to Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, Phillips 66, Valero Energy, and Tesoro relating to an investigation into possible price-fixing.[121]\nMitrice Richardson was a 24-year-old African American woman who was released from the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department in the middle of the night without any means of fending for herself. Her body was later found in an isolated canyon, leaving the family with many unanswered questions. In 2016, the Attorney General opened a criminal investigation into the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's handling of the Mitrice Richardson case. The AG's Office had originally declined the request of the Richardson family to investigate the case, but reversed course after the family and supporters submitted almost 500 pages of evidence to Harris's office in the hope of prompting an investigation.[122][123][124] In December 2016, the California Attorney General's Office closed the investigation, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support criminal prosecution of anyone involved in the handling of the Richardson case.[125]\nIn October 2016, Harris announced the arrest of Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer on felony charges of pimping a minor, pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping. The arrest warrant alleged that 99% of Backpage's revenue was directly attributable to prostitution-related ads, many of which involved victims of sex trafficking, including children under the age of 18.[126]\nThe pimping charge against Ferrer was dismissed by the California courts in 2016 on the grounds of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but in 2018 Ferrer ultimately pleaded guilty in California to money laundering and agreed to give evidence against the former co-owners of Backpage, Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.[127] Ferrer simultaneously pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and conspiracy to facilitate prostitution in Texas state court and Arizona federal court.[127][128][129]\nIn January 2017, following government pressure, Backpage announced that it was removing its adult section from all of its sites in the United States.[130] Harris welcomed the move, saying \"I look forward to them shutting down completely.\"[131] The investigations continued after she became a senator and in April 2018, Backpage and affiliated sites were seized by federal law enforcement around the same time as Ferrer's guilty plea.[128]\nDuring Obama's presidency, Harris was mentioned as a possible nominee for the United States Supreme Court[132][133] or U.S. Attorney General,[134] but she was not nominated to either office.[135]\nAfter 24 years as California's junior senator, Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) announced her intention to retire from the United States Senate at the end of her term in 2016. Harris was the first candidate to declare her intention to run for Boxer's senate seat. Media outlets reported that she would run for senate on the same day that Gavin Newsom, California's Lieutenant Governor and a close political ally of Harris, announced he would not seek to succeed Boxer.[136] Harris officially announced the launch of her campaign on January 13, 2015.[137]\nHarris hosted fundraisers in California and Washington, D.C., raising $2.5 million for her campaign.[138]\nIn December 2015, the National Journal reported that Harris' campaign spending rate contributed to her cash on hand being closer to that of another candidate, Loretta Sanchez, who had just $1.6 million.[139][140]\nIn 2016, Harris was the only Democratic candidate for the Senate to receive a campaign contribution from Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin.  Mnuchin donated $2,000 to Harris' campaign.[141]  Harris was criticized for accepting the donation because Mnuchin profited from the subprime mortgage crisis and when Harris was the Attorney General of California, she declined, without explanation, to prosecute OneWest Bank \u2013\u2013 which Mnuchin founded and ran \u2013\u2013 over foreclosures the bank executed while incurring over 1,000 violations to California foreclosure laws (and despite the recommendations of investigators in her own office to file a civil enforcement action against the bank), and because Harris was afforded a vote in Mnuchin's 2017 confirmation to become United States Secretary of the Treasury.[141][142][102] The Intercept said of Harris' fundraising:\n\"Harris\u2019s prodigious fundraising also raises questions about how attentive she is to the needs of campaign contributors.\"[102]\nHarris was a frontrunner from the beginning of her campaign.\nIn January 2015, weeks after she announced her campaign, a survey by Public Policy Polling showed her leading in a hypothetical match-up against Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, 41% to 16%, respectively.[143] Four months later, a Field Poll showed that though nearly 60% of likely voters did not have a favored candidate, at nearly 20%, she was most preferred candidate of the field.[144] Five months later, she led another Field Poll, at 30%, besting fellow Democratic candidate, Loretta Sanchez, by nearly 15 percentage points.  Harris increased her support despite The Sacramento Bee noting she had not been active in campaigning since appearing at the California Democratic Party's convention.[145]\nIn February 2016, the California Democratic Party voted at its convention to endorse Harris, who received nearly 80% of the vote, with only 60% needed to secure the endorsement.[146][147] Three months later, Governor Jerry Brown endorsed her.[148]\nOn July 19, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Harris.[149]\nAll candidates participated in a primary election in June 2016, after which the top two candidates from any party would advance to the general election.[147]\nHarris entered the debates against the other major candidates as the front-runner.[150][151]  On the June 7 primary, she came in first place with 40% of the votes, winning in over 80% of California's 58 counties \u2013\u2013 including seven counties where she won more than 50% of the vote.[152][153]\nFollowing the primary, Harris faced Congresswoman, and fellow Democrat, Loretta Sanchez, in the general election.[154]  It was the first time a Republican did not appear in a general election for the Senate since California began directly electing senators in 1914.[155]\nIn the November 2016 election, Harris defeated Sanchez, capturing over 60% of the vote, carrying all but four counties.[156] Following her victory, she promised to protect immigrants from the policies of President-elect Donald Trump.[157]\nFollowing her election to the United States Senate, Harris announced her intention to remain California's Attorney General through the end of 2016 and resign shortly before being sworn in as Senator on January 3, 2017.[158] Governor Jerry Brown announced his intention to nominate Congressman Xavier Becerra as her successor.[159]\nOn January 28, after Trump signed Executive Order 13769, barring citizens from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, she condemned the order and was one of many to describe it as a \"Muslim ban\".[160][161] When John F. Kelly was White House Chief of Staff, she called him at home to gather information and push back against the contentious executive order.[162]\n\nIn early February, Harris spoke in opposition to Trump's cabinet picks Betsy DeVos, for Secretary of Education,[163] and Jeff Sessions, for United States Attorney General.[164] Later that month, in her first speech on the senate floor, she spent 12 minutes critiquing Trump's immigration policies.[165] In early March, she called on Attorney General Sessions to resign, after it was reported that Sessions spoke twice with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.[166] On March 14, she argued that repealing the Affordable Care Act would send the message of health care's being a \"privilege\" rather than a \"civil right\".[167]On June 7, 2017, Harris garnered media attention for her questioning of Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, over the role he played in the May 2017 firing of James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[168] The prosecutorial nature of her questioning caused Senator John McCain, an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman, to interrupt her and request that she be more respectful of the witness;[168] other Democrats on the committee pointed out that they had asked similarly tough questions, but had not been interrupted.[168] On June 13, she questioned Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, on the same topic;[169] She was again interrupted by McCain and Burr.[169] Sessions stated that her mode of questioning \"makes me nervous\";[169] other Democratic members of the committee again pointed out that she was the only senator whose questioning was interrupted with an admonishment from the chairman.[169] Burr's singling out of Harris sparked suggestion in the news media that his behavior was sexist, with commentators arguing that Burr would not treat a male Senate colleague in a similar manner.[170] In addition, when CNN pundit Jason Miller described her as \"hysterical\", Kirsten Powers, who was taking part in the same on-air segment, told Miller that his use of the term to describe Harris was sexist, and that he would not describe male senators in the same manner.[171]\nIn July 2017, Harris voted in favor of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea.[172]\nIn a January 2018 hearing, Harris questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for favoring Norwegian immigrants over others and claiming to be unaware that Norway is a predominantly white country.[173]\nIn an April 2018 hearing, Harris questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for Facebook's misuse of users' data.[174]\nIn response to the administration's family separation policy, Harris visited one of the detention facilities near the border in June 2018.[175]\nIn the September and October 2018 Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Harris participated in questioning the FBI Director's limited scope of the investigation on Kavanaugh.[176]\nHarris was one of the targets of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts.[177]\nIn February 2019, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted, \"It's all about the Benjamins baby\" in reference to American politicians' support for Israel and invoked the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). A number of Democratic leaders\u00a0\u2013 including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0\u2013 condemned the tweet, which was interpreted as implying that money was fueling American politicians' support of Israel.[178] Harris defended Ilhan Omar, saying that \"We should be having a sound, respectful discussion about policy. You can both support Israel and be loyal to our country. I also believe there is a difference between criticism of policy or political leaders, and anti-Semitism.\"[179]\nSource: Los Angeles Times\nHarris had been considered a top contender and potential frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination for President.[183][184][185] In June 2018, she was quoted as \"not ruling it out.\"[186] In July 2018, it was announced that she would publish a memoir, a sign of a possible run.[187] As of that month, she was spending more on Facebook advertising than any other senator.[188] She also stumped for candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.[189][190][191]\nOn January 21, 2019, Harris officially announced her  candidacy for President of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election.[192] In the first 24 hours after her candidacy announcement, she tied a record set by Bernie Sanders in 2016 for the most donations raised in the day following an announcement.[193] However, Sanders later broke this record after announcing his own 2020 presidential campaign.[194] Over 20,000 people attended her formal campaign launch event in her hometown of Oakland, California on January 27, according to a police estimate.[195]\nDuring the first Democratic presidential debate in June 2019, Harris scolded former vice president Joe Biden for having opposed mandatory school bussing. Her widely quoted comment was, \"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.\"[196][197] Harris's support rose by between 6 and 9 points in polls following that debate.[198][199] In the second debate in August, Harris was confronted by Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard over her record as Attorney General, notably her past positions on marijuana, cash bail, and parole reform.[200] Harris fell in the polls following that debate.[201] Over the next few months her poll numbers fell to the low single digits.[202] On December 3, 2019, Harris withdrew from seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination,[203][204][205] citing a shortage of funds to continue her campaign.[206]\nIn 2013, when she was California Attorney General, Harris allowed the Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian to cease the availability of elective abortions, after it entered a partnership with Catholic chain, St. Joseph Health System.[207] The ban was made due to St. Joseph's \"sensitivity\" about abortion.  As the Attorney General, Harris had legal authority to decide on any such change, as a condition of her approving a major transaction involving any non-profit medical institution in the state.[207]  The ban would not be able to go into affect without her knowledge or approval.[207]  Harris did set conditions on the ban, requiring the hospital to \"take steps to ensure that alternative providers are available and accessible to all women, especially low-income women for direct abortions\" in the hospital's serviceable area.[207]\nCritics voiced concern that by imposing Catholic doctrine on its operations, St. Joseph was reducing the availability of reproductive services while receiving millions of dollars from taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and a legal status that allowed it to be tax-exempt while taking tax deductions.[207]\nIn July 2015, an organization called \"The Center for Medical Progress\" (dba \"Biomax\"), a registered California non-profit corporation posted five videos, shot in Texas, as evidence of proof that Planned Parenthood was \"illegally trafficking aborted fetal parts.\"[208]  The videos were found to be manipulated \u2013\u2013 propaganda produced by anti-abortion activists who used fake California identification to establish a ghost California non-profit corporation.[209]  Within two months of the videos' posting, a Texas grand jury indicted the two activists responsible for producing them.  However, as of March 2016, Harris had yet to make any determination on the matter:\n\"In July, our politically ambitious attorney general, Kamala Harris, vowed to 'carefully review' the 'Center for Medical Progress...what is [she] waiting for?'[209]\nWhile a spokesperson for Harris said that \"the office does not comment on investigations, or even confirm whether an investigation exists,\" abortion rights advocates began to speculate that Harris' senatorial campaign to replace Barbara Boxer might have contributed to Harris' \"lack of urgency\" on the case.[209]\nHowever, in September 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed \"Assembly Bill 1671\" into law, which was reportedly drafted by Harris, with input from Planned Parenthood \u2013\u2013 which sponsored the bill \u2013\u2013 making it a criminal offense to intentionally distribute, or to help with the dissemination of, unlawfully obtained confidential communications.[210][211] Libertarians, filmmakers and news organizations vehemently opposed the bill which was signed into law after late amendments were added to it.[212]\nSince her election to the Senate, Harris has maintained a 100% rating by the abortion rights advocacy group, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and a 0% rating by the anti-abortion group, National Right to Life Committee.[213] She was also endorsed by Emily's List in 2015 during her Senatorial Campaign.[214]\nHarris's 2020 campaign has disavowed most corporate donations, and has committed to rejecting money from corporate political action committees for her presidential campaign, in favor of relying on small and large individual donors.[215][216][217]\n\"Our campaign is not taking a dime from corporate PACs or lobbyists \u2013\u2013 and that was a very deliberate choice.\"[218]\nHowever, in April 2019, after the FEC released donation information, Harris was found to have accepted more donations from registered lobbyists among all the Democratic Presidential Nominees who vowed to not do so,[218] receiving such donations from federal, state, municipal and corporate lobbyists who represent entities such as Verizon, Airbnb, AT&amp;T, Novartis, Visa, Pfizer, Cigna, IBM, Google, along with lobbyists that represent industries such as charter schools, construction, and real estate.[218]\nHarris, along with candidates Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Marianne Williamson, has explicitly discouraged single-candidate super PACs from operating on her behalf, though she cannot prevent them from doing so.[219]\nIn the first quarter of 2019, nearly 40% of Harris's donations came from small donors (donations of less than $200), while over 60% of her donations came from large donors (donations of $200 or more).[220]\nHarris did not initially support the legalization of recreational marijuana, but later moved to support legalization.[215] In 2010, while campaigning for Attorney General of California, she opposed Proposition 19, the first failed attempt to legalize recreational marijuana in California, on the grounds that selling drugs harms communities.[221] In 2015, she called for an end on the federal prohibition of medical marijuana.[222]\nIn April 2018, following reports that the Justice Department was blocking the Drug Enforcement Administration from taking action on over two dozen requests to grow marijuana for use in research, Harris and Republican Orrin Hatch sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the necessity of marijuana research \"for evidence-based decision making\" and \"to resolve critical questions of public health and safety, such as learning the impacts of marijuana on developing brains and formulating methods to test marijuana impairment in drivers.\"[223]\nIn May 2018, Harris announced she would co-sponsor the Marijuana Justice Act (originally introduced by Senator Cory Booker in August 2017) which would legalize cannabis at the federal level by removing it from the Controlled Substance Act. The bill would also require federal courts to automatically expunge earlier federal marijuana convictions related to use or possession and would penalize states that enforce cannabis laws in a disproportionate manner against minority or low-income individuals.[224][225]\nIn July 2019, Harris and Representative Jerry Nadler introduced the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019, legislation that would legalize marijuana on the federal level in addition to expunging low-level marijuana possession convictions and authorizing grants to members of communities of color as part of an effort to reverse decades of damage cannabis criminalization had inflicted to those respective communities. In a statement, Harris cited the need to regulate marijuana and ensuring \"everyone \u2014 especially communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs \u2014 has a real opportunity to participate in this growing industry.\"[226]\nHarris is opposed to the death penalty, but has said that she would review each case individually.[227] Her position was questioned in April 2004, when SFPD Officer Isaac Espinoza was murdered in the Bayview district. She announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing. The decision evoked protests from the San Francisco Police Officers Association, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others.[7] Those who supported her decision not to seek the death penalty included San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Sophie Maxwell, in whose district the murder occurred.[228] The jury found the convicted killer, David Hill, guilty of second-degree murder, although the prosecutor, Harry Dorfman, had sought a first-degree murder conviction.[229] The defense had argued that Hill thought Espinoza was a member of a rival gang, and that the murder was not premeditated. Hill was given the maximum sentence for the conviction, life without the possibility of parole.[229]\nHarris's position against the death penalty was tested again in the case of Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member who was accused of murdering Tony Bologna and his sons Michael and Matthew.[60] On September 10, 2009, she announced she would seek life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than the death penalty in the Ramos case.[230]\nHarris has expressed the belief that life without possibility of parole is a better, and more cost-effective, punishment.[231] According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, the death penalty costs $137 million per year.[232] If the system were changed to life without possibility of parole, the annual costs would be approximately $12 million per year.[232] She noted that the resulting surplus could put 1,000 more police officers into service in San Francisco alone.[231]\nWhen in 2014, U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney declared capital punishment in California unconstitutional, Harris appealed the case.[7]\nOn July 31, 2019, following Attorney General William Barr announcing that the United States federal government would resume the use of the death penalty for the first time in over twenty years, Harris was a cosponsor of a bill banning the death penalty.[233]\nIn August 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sign a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency charging the agency with not assisting displaced homeowners in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria under the Individuals and Households program (IHP) at \"alarming rates.\"[234]\nHarris has argued for treating \"habitual and chronic truancy\" among children in elementary school as a crime committed by the parents of truant children.[235] She argues that there is a direct connection between habitual truancy in elementary school and crime later in life.[236][237] She has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers.[78]\nHarris opposed California's ban on affirmative action.[238] She asked the Supreme Court to \"reaffirm its decision that public colleges and universities may consider race as one factor in admissions decisions.\"[239][240] Harris filed legal papers in the Supreme Court case supporting race as an admissions factor at the University of Texas.[239] She also filed papers supporting affirmative action in a different Supreme Court case involving the University of Michigan.[241]\nHarris supports busing for desegregation of public schools, saying that \"the schools of America are as segregated, if not more segregated, today than when I was in elementary school.\"[242] Harris views busing as an option to be considered by school districts, rather than the responsibility of the federal government.[243]\nOn December 21, 2017, Harris was one of six senators to introduce the \"Secure Elections Act\", legislation authorizing block grants for states that would update outdated voting technology. The act would also create a program for an independent panel of experts to develop cybersecurity guidelines for election systems that states could adopt if they choose, along with offering states resources to implement the recommendations.[244]\nIn May 2019, Harris was a cosponsor of the Protecting American Votes and Elections (PAVE) Act, legislation granting the United States Department of Homeland Security the authority \"to set minimum cybersecurity standards for U.S. voting machines, authorize a one-time $500 million grant program for states to buy ballot-scanning machines to count paper ballots and require states to conduct risk-limiting audits of all federal elections in order to detect any cyber hacks.\"[245]\nDuring her time as San Francisco District Attorney, Harris created the Environmental Justice Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office[246] and prosecuted several industries and individuals for pollution, most notably U-Haul, Alameda Publishing Corporation, and the Cosco Busan oil spill. She also advocated for strong enforcement of environmental protection laws.[247]\nIn October 2017, Harris was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt questioning Pruitt's decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan, asserting that the repeal's proposal used \"mathematical sleights of hand to over-state the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized\" and science denying and math fabricating would fail to \"satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing.\"[248]\nIn September 2018, Harris was one of eight senators to sponsor the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, a bill described by cosponsor Elizabeth Warren as using \"market forces to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy\u00a0\u2013 reducing the odds of an environmental and financial disaster without spending a dime of taxpayer money.\"[249] She stated that her goal would be achieving 100% of U.S. electricity from renewable energy sources, and that she supports a Green New Deal, an idea made popular by first term Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, because \"climate change is an existential threat to all of us.\"[250]\nIn November 2018, Harris was one of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution specifying key findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action toward addressing climate change.[251]\nOn July 29, 2019, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez introduced the Climate Equity Act, a bill that would lay out steps for Congress and the White House on how to go about guaranteeing policies that composed \"a future Green New Deal protect the health and economic wellbeing of all Americans for generations to come.\" Referring to climate change as \"an existential threat\", Harris noted cutting emissions and ending American reliance on fossil fuels were not enough and cited the need \"that communities already contending with unsafe drinking water, toxic air, and lack of economic opportunity are not left behind.\"[252]\nOn September 4, 2019, Harris unveiled a $10 trillion climate change plan intended to move the United States to a 100 percent renewable energy-based power grid by 2030 in addition to transitioning all vehicles in America to the same energy sources by 2035. She pledged to rejoin the Paris Agreement and end U.S. support for international oil and natural gas extraction projects, furthering that as president she would \"hold polluters accountable for the damage they inflict upon our environment and set us on a path to a 100 percent clean economy that creates millions of good-paying jobs.\"[253]\nIn April 2017, responding to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Harris charged Syrian president Bashar al-Assad with attacking Syrian children, and stated \"the clear fact that president Assad is not only a ruthless dictator brutalizing his own people \u2013 he is a war criminal the international community cannot ignore.\" She called on President Trump to work with Congress on his administration's \"lack of clear objectives in Syria and articulate a detailed strategy and path forward in partnership with our allies.\"[254]\nIn 2017, Harris gave a public address to AIPAC attendees. She said: \"I believe Israel should never be a partisan issue, and as long as I'm a United States senator, I will do everything in my power to ensure broad and bipartisan support for Israel's security and right to self-defense.\"[255] She has opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel.[256] She was a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.[257][258][256] At the AIPAC conference, she said that \"the first resolution I co-sponsored as a United States senator was to combat anti-Israel bias at the United Nations\".[257] She also supported a Senate resolution celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.[259][260] In late 2017, she traveled to Israel, where she met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[257]\nIn October 2017, Harris condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[261]\nIn February 2018, Harris was one of 18 Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump stating that he lacked the authority to launch a preemptive strike against North Korea without authorization from Congress. The letter stated: \"Without congressional authority, a preventative or preemptive U.S. military strike would lack either a constitutional basis or legal authority.\"[262]\nIn 2018, after Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Harris released a statement saying the decision \"jeopardizes our national security and isolates us from our closest allies\" while calling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \"the best existing tool we have to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and avoid a disastrous military conflict in the Middle East.\"[263] In late 2018, she voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. She also backed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul.[264]\nHarris supported the Iran nuclear deal to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.[256] In December 2018, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, she was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration \"now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries\" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.[265]\nHarris voted in favor of a $675 billion defense budget bill for 2019.[266] She said that North Korea is \"one of the most serious security threats\".[267] In February 2019, after former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe claimed that President Trump believed the claims of President of Russia Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies' reports on the subject of North Korea's missile capabilities, she told reporters, \"The idea that the president of the U.S. would take the word of the head of Russia over the intel community is the height of irresponsibility and shameful.\"[268] In an August 2019 interview with the Council on Foreign Relations, when asked if she as president would sign an agreement with North Korea granting partial sanctions relief in exchange for some denuclearization, Harris replied that President Trump had given \"Kim one PR victory after the next, all without securing any real concessions\" and that she would \"consider targeted sanctions relief to improve the lives of the North Korean people if the regime were to take serious, verifiable steps to roll back its nuclear program.\"[269]\nHarris criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which critics say gave Turkey the green light to launch the military offensive against Syrian Kurds.[270]\nHarris earned an \"F\" rating from the National Rifle Association for her consistent efforts supporting gun control.[271]\nWhile serving as district attorney in San Francisco Harris, along with other district attorneys, filed an amicus brief in District of Columbia v. Heller arguing that the Washington, D.C. gun law at issue did not violate the Second Amendment.[272] In her second term as district attorney, she said that getting guns off the streets was a priority.[273]\nDuring her run for Senate, Harris was endorsed by former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, who had been shot in Tucson in 2011. She was also endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.[274]\nIn response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Harris supported the call for more gun control. Saying that she believed that thoughts and prayers are inadequate answers to the shooting, she stated that \"...we must also commit ourselves to action. Another moment of silence won't suffice.\"[275][276]\nSpeaking to Wolf Blitzer in August 2019, Harris stated that congressional action on gun control rested in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and that she \"would hope and pray that he understands that he actually has the power to do the right thing here and that he will do the right thing.\"[277]\nOn August 14, 2019, Harris unveiled a plan that would address domestic terrorism while prioritizing increasing the difficulty for suspected individuals to either obtain or keep firearms through the formation of domestic terrorism prevention orders meant to empower law enforcement officers and family members with the ability to petition federal court for a temporary restriction on a person's access to firearms in the event that they \"exhibit clear evidence of dangerousness.\" Harris stated that in the US \"loaded guns should not be a few clicks away for any domestic terrorist with a laptop or smartphone\u201d and cited the \"need to take action to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and stop violent, hate-fueled attacks before they happen.\"[278]\nHarris owns a gun for \"personal safety\", as she was a career prosecutor.[279]\nOn August 30, 2017, Harris announced at a town hall in Oakland that she would co-sponsor fellow Senator Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" bill, supporting single-payer healthcare.[280][215]\nIn April 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sponsor the Choose Medicare Act, an expanded public option for health insurance that also increased ObamaCare subsidies and rendered individuals with higher income levels eligible for its assistance.[281]\nIn December 2018, Harris was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \"increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\" The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress.\"[282]\nOn July 29, 2019, Harris unveiled a health plan that would expand coverage while preserving a role for private insurance companies, the plan calling for transitioning to a Medicare for All system over a period of ten years that would be concurrent with infants and the uninsured automatically being placed into the system while other individuals would have the option to buy into the health care plan backed by the government.[283] The plan has been met with some criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.[284]\nHarris has expressed support for San Francisco's sanctuary city policy of not inquiring about immigration status in the process of a criminal investigation.[285] She argued that it is important that immigrants be able to talk with law enforcement without fear.[286]\nOn October 25, 2017, Harris stated she would not support a spending bill until Congress addressed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in a way that clarified \"what we are going to do to protect and take care of our DACA young people in this country.\"[287] She did not support a February 2018 proposal by some Democrats to provide President Trump with $25 billion in funding for a border wall in exchange for giving DREAMers a pathway to citizenship.[288]\nIn a January 2018 interview, when asked by Hiram Soto about her ideal version of a bipartisan deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Harris stated the need to focus on comprehensive immigration reform and \"pass a clean DREAM Act.\"[289]\nIn January 2018, Harris and three other Democratic senators were cosponsors of the Border and Port Security Act, legislation that would mandate U.S. Customs and Border Protection \"hire, train and assign at least 500 officers per year until the number of needed positions the model identifies is filled\" in addition to requiring the commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection to determine potential equipment and infrastructure improvements that could be used for ports of entry.[290]\nIn April 2018, Harris was one of five senators to send a letter to acting director of ICE Thomas Homan on standards used by the agency when determining how to detain a pregnant woman, requesting that pregnant women not be held in custody unless under extraordinary standards after reports \"that ICE has failed to provide critical medical care to pregnant women in immigration detention\u00a0\u2013 resulting in miscarriages and other negative health outcomes\".[291]\nIn July 2018, the Trump administration falsely accused Harris of \"supporting the animals of MS-13.\"[292][293] She responded, \"As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.\"[292]\nIn July 2018, Harris was one of 22 senators to sponsor the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act, which if enacted would prohibit immigration officers from detaining pregnant women in a majority of circumstances and improve conditions of care for individuals in custody.[294]\nIn August 2018, Harris led fifteen Democrats and Bernie Sanders in a letter to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying \"trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.\"[295]\nIn November 2018, Harris was one of eleven senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis concerning \"the overt politicization of the military\" with the Trump administration's deployment of 5,800 troops to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, and requesting a briefing and written justification from the U.S. Northern Command for troop deployment, while urging Mattis to \"curb the unprecedented escalation of DOD involvement in immigration enforcement.\"[296]\nIn January 2019, Harris was one of twenty senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill imposing a ban on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from passing information collected on DACA recipients to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Justice, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies being investigated.[297]\nIn June 2019, following the Housing and Urban Development Department's confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federal backed loans, Harris and eleven other senators introduced The Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to the immigration status of an applicant.[298]\nIn July 2019, along with Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar, Harris sent a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement asserting that the agency \"should be prioritizing reunification of every child as soon as possible, but instead it has been responsible for policies that are forcing longer stays in government custody for children\" and that it was mandatory that the office \"ensure that the custody and processing of [unaccompanied migrant children] is meeting the minimum standards required by domestic and international law.\"[299]\nIn July 2019, Harris and fifteen other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor ahead of engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations with the exception of special circumstances and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to report annually regarding enforcement actions in those locations.[300]\nIn August 2019, after the Trump administration released a new regulation imposing the possibility that any green card and visa applicants could be turned down in the event they have low incomes or little education and have used benefits such as food stamps and housing vouchers at some point, Harris referred to the regulation as part of President Trump's ongoing campaign \"to vilify a whole group of people\" and cited Trump's sending of service members to the southern border and building a border wall as part of his goal to distract \"from the fact that he has betrayed so many people and has actually done very little that has been productive in the best interest of American families.\"[301]\nDuring her tenure as California Attorney General, Harris declined to defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage in court. She supported the Obama administration's guidance supporting transgender students. Following the Supreme Court's overturning of the ban on same-sex marriage, she proceeded to conduct California's first same-sex marriage.[302] Later on in 2015, she argued in court to withhold gender reassignment surgery from two transgender inmates who were prescribed the procedure while serving the sentences. This stance disappointed some LGBT rights advocates; she later stated that she only took that stance in court because her job required her to do so.[303]\nAs a member of the U.S. Senate, she co-sponsored the Equality Act.[303]\nOn October 7, 2019, Harris unveiled a six months paid family and medical leave plan that included forming a new Office of Paid Family and Medical Leave that would oversee, determine eligibility and authorize benefit payments. Harris's paid leave program would be funded through general revenue and payroll contributions and establish a federal Bureau of Children and Family Justice. In a statement, Harris said the US will be brought \"closer to economic justice for workers and ensures newborn children or children who are sick can get the care they need from a parent without thrusting the family into upheaval\" via a six-month paid leave guarantee.[304]\nIn September 2017, Harris was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai that charged the FCC with failing \"to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to comment on the tens of thousands of filed complaints that directly shed light on proposed changes to existing net neutrality protections.\"[305]\nIn March 2018, Harris was one of ten senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Jeff Merkley lambasting a proposal from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai that would curb the scope of benefits from the Lifeline program during a period where roughly 6.5 million people in poor communities relied on Lifeline to receive access to high-speed internet, citing that it was Pai's \"obligation to the American public, as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to improve the Lifeline program and ensure that more Americans can afford access, and have means of access, to broadband and phone service.\" The senators also advocated for insuring \"Lifeline reaches more Americans in need of access to communication services.\"[306]\nIn a September 2019 letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Harris called for the creation of a task force to investigate allegations against Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and look into whether Kavanaugh lied to Congress during his testimony the previous year as a Supreme Court nominee.[307] In October 2019, when asked whether she thought a president undergoing impeachment inquiries should be authorized to nominate Supreme Court justices, Harris replied, \"That's a great question. I think he should be put on a timeout across the board.\"[308]\nHarris opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and has called for a repeal of the bill's tax cuts for wealthy Americans.[309] In 2018, she proposed a tax cut for the majority of working- and middle-class Americans. An analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the bill would reduce federal revenue by $2.8 trillion over a decade. She proposed to pay for the tax cuts by repealing tax cuts for wealthy Americans and by increasing taxes on corporations.[216][309][310]\nIn May 2019, Harris stated she would not have voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) due to her belief that \"we can do a better job to protect American workers\" and called for the United States to do \"a better job in terms of thinking about the priorities that should be more apparent now than perhaps they were then, which are issues like the climate crisis and what we need to build into these trade agreements.\"[311]\nIn May 2019, Harris attributed the 2018 gubernatorial losses of Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, in both Georgia and Florida to voter suppression.[312]\nHarris is married to California attorney Douglas Emhoff,[313] who was at one time partner-in-charge at Venable LLP's Los Angeles office.[314] Emhoff is Jewish.[315] They married on August 22, 2014, in Santa Barbara, California.[313] The couple do not have children together, but Harris is stepmother to Cole and Ella, Emhoff's two children from his previous marriage.[316][317][318]\nHer sister is Maya Harris, an MSNBC political analyst, and her brother-in-law is Tony West, general counsel of Uber and a former United States Department of Justice senior official.[8][9]\nFrom 1994 to 1995, Harris dated then-California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown.[35][36][37]  Brown is 30 years older than Harris and was separated from his wife during their relationship.[17] Harris has said that she met Brown because their social circles overlapped: \"Black people who go to college have about two degrees of separation with other black professionals, and those who go to law school have even less. The networks of black lawyers in California are small\".[17] Harris ended the relationship.[17]\nHarris has received honorary degrees from Howard University and from the University of Southern California.[319][320]\nHarris is a Baptist.[321]\nThe Washington Post reported the 2018 income of Harris and Emhoff as $1.9 million.[322][323][324] As of August 2019, Harris and her husband have a net worth of $5.8 million.[325]  They own homes in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San Francisco.[325]\nHarris has written two non-fiction books and one children's book.[326][327] She also wrote the entry for Christine Blasey Ford when Ford was named one of the Time 100 people in 2019.[328]\n</body></html>"
