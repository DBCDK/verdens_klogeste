After being dropped by Motown Records, Mars signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2009. In the same year, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for various successful singles for Mars himself and other artists. Mars rose to fame in 2010 with the release of the successful singles \"Nothin' on You\" by B.o.B and \"Billionaire\" by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals on the hooks. His debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010) spawned the international number-one singles \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Grenade\", and \"The Lazy Song\". The former won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. Mars' second album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), became his first number one album on the US Billboard 200 and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Its singles \"Locked Out of Heaven\" and \"When I Was Your Man\", reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 2014, Mars collaborated with Mark Ronson on \"Uptown Funk\", which topped many music charts worldwide and won Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 2016 Grammy Awards.

Peter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot, and was raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu.[1][2] His father is of half Puerto Rican and half Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Ukraine and Hungary), and is originally from Brooklyn, New York.[2][3][4] His mother emigrated from the Philippines to Hawaii as a child, and was of Filipino, and some Spanish, ancestry.[2][3] His parents met while performing in a show in which his mother was a hula dancer and his father played percussion.[4] At the age of two, he was nicknamed \"Bruno\" by his father because of his resemblance to professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino.[5][6] Mars is one of six children and came from a musical family which exposed him to a diverse mix of music genres, including reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&B.[7][8] His mother was both a singer and a dancer, and his father performed Little Richard rock and roll music.[4][9] Mars' uncle was an Elvis impersonator, and also encouraged three-year-old Mars to perform on stage. Mars performed songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations.[6] At the age of four, Mars began performing five days a week with his family's band, The Love Notes, and became known in Hawaii for his impersonation of Elvis Presley.[10] When he was five he peed himself during a performance of Elvis' \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (1961), which led his parents to think they could be making a mistake. However, Mars never quited.[4] In 1990, Mars was featured in the Hawaiian tabloid shopper MidWeek as \"Little Elvis\" and performed in the halftime show of the 1990 Aloha Bowl.[6][11] In 1992, he appeared in a cameo role in the film Honeymoon in Vegas and was interviewed by Pauly Shore on MTV. When Mars was six years-old, he was featured on The Arsenio Hall Show and throughout grade school, he performed with his family's band, two shows a night, covering Frankie Lymon and Little Anthony, as well. When he was a child he had a small version of a drum set, guitar, piano and some percussion and learned to play the instruments. By age 12, his parents divorced, thus ending The Love Notes act. His father's various businesses, that ranged from temporary-tattoo parlor to memorabilia shops, failed. Consequently, there was no longer a steady source of income. He moved out of his parents' house along with his brother and father. They lived in the \"slums of Hawaii\", on the back of a car, on rooftops, and in an abandoned bird zoo, Paradise Park, where Mars' father worked before it closed.[4][12] The singer had to move to a new schools and initially he was bullied, but he became popular in his last school days.[4] Nevertheless, the time Mars spent impersonating Presley had a major impact on his musical evolution and performing techniques.[13] He later began playing guitar after being inspired by American rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix.[14] In 2010, he also acknowledged his Hawaiian roots and musical family as an influence, explaining: \"Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments... I've just been surrounded by it.\"[15][2] When he attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu he sung in a group called The School Boys, who did several shows including opening for Mars' father new band. The singer, while in high school, passed for the big time of Hawaiian entertainment, becoming the opening gig for a huge magic show and impersonating Michael Jackson in a celebrity-impersonators show, making $75 for performance.[4][16] After Mars' sister in Los Angeles, California played his demo for Mike Lynn, (the head of A&R at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment record label), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles.[17] In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career.[6][18] At that time, he lived on Mansfield and remembers trying to park his car and finding the parking space with a homeless guy, \"taking a shit\", with \"no toilet paper, nothing! It was just foul, and no one cleaned it up.\"[4] He adopted his stage name from the childhood nickname his father gave him, adding \"Mars\" at the end because: \"I felt like I didn't have [any] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I\u2019m out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars.\"[19] Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also an effort to \"avoid being stereotyped\", as the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latin artist. They even tried to convince Mars to sing in Spanish.[20] \u2014Mars, speaking about his experiences of moving to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career.[21] Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Mars signed a record contract with Motown Records in 2004, but the deal \"went nowhere\", leading him to have a conversation with will.i.am's management, which also turned out to be fruitless.[22][20] However, the singer's experience with Motown proved to be beneficial to his career. Songwriter Philip Lawrence was also signed to the label.[22] After Mars was dropped by the label less than a year after being signed, he stayed in Los Angeles and landed a music publishing deal in 2005 with American record producer Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent.[23][17] \u2014Cameron Strang, speaking about developing Mars' career.[17] Lindsey showed Mars and fellow songwriters Brody Brown and Jeff Bhasker (who Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music and acted as a mentor, helping them to hone their craft.[17][24][25] Bhasker explained that Lindsey would \"mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because you can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline.\"[25][23] In a different interview Brown corroborated this story.[24] During this time, Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in a band called Sex Panther with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez (Mars' brother), who eventually became the drummer of Mars' main band, The Hooligans.[17][26] When Philip Lawrence was first told he should meet Mars he was reluctant to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, drummer for the American musical group The Black Eyed Peas, told Lawrence: \"Whatever it costs you to get out here, I'll reimburse you.\" Lawrence responded: \"Just give me five dollars back for the bus.\"[27] The pair began collaborating, writing songs for Mars, but they received many rejections from record labels. On the verge of giving up, they received a call from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited Menudo. He liked their song \"Lost\", which was written for Mars. The duo did not want to give the song away, but when they were offered $20,000 for it, they agreed. The sale of this song allowed them to continue working,[27] and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs together for other artists.[17] Eventually, Creed became Mars' manager for nine years.[27][28] In 2006, Lawrence introduced Mars to his future A&R manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck.[29] After hearing him play a couple of songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt it was too early and that he still needed to develop as an artist.[23][29] Before becoming a successful solo artist, Mars was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for the likes of Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, Sean Kingston, and Flo Rida.[7][21] He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song \"Get Sexy\" (2009) and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7 (2010).[30] His first recorded appearance as a singer was on Far East Movement's second studio album, Animal, on the track \"3D\" (2009).[31] He was also featured on American pastor and hip hop artist Jaeson Ma's debut single \"Love\" in August 2009 and on Travie McCoy's \"One At a Time\" (2009), a charity single for MTV's Staying Alive foundation.[32][33][34] He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on, and composing (as part of the production group The Smeezingtons) B.o.B's \"Nothin' on You\" (2009) and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\" (2010); both songs peaked within the top ten of many music charts worldwide, with the former charting at number one on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.[35][36][37] Mars said of these successful singles: \"I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of \"Nothin' on You\", it might've sounded like some '90s R&B.\"[38] Then, on May 11, 2010, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand.[39] The EP peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200 US albums chart and a music video was released for the song \"The Other Side\" featuring CeeLo Green and B.o.B.[40][41] Mars, under The Smeezingtons, composed Green's single \"Fuck You\" (2010).[42] After serving as guest vocalist on B.o.B's and Travie McCoy's singles,[43] Mars released \"Just the Way You Are\" on July 20, 2010.[44] The song was the lead single from his debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010), and reached number one in the US, Canada, the UK,[35][45][36] and several other countries worldwide.[37] The song holds the record as the longest-reigning debut adult contemporary format hit, spending twenty weeks atop the Adult Contemporary chart in the United States.[46] Mars also released two promotional singles, \"Liquor Store Blues\" featuring Damian Marley and \"Grenade\", before confirming the latter as the album's second single on October 21, 2010.[47][48] \"Grenade\" also reached number one on the US Hot 100, Canada, and the UK.[35][45][36] It was also successful on other international charts.[37] The album, released on October 5, 2010, in the United States, debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 55,000 copies in its first week of release in the US.[49][50] It charted at number one in Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other international album charts.[51][36][37] Doo-Wops & Hooligans received generally positive reviews from music critics and has since sold six million copies worldwide.[52][53] In February 2011, \"The Lazy Song\" was released as the third single from Doo-Wops & Hooligans[54] and became the album's third consecutive top-five hit on the Hot 100, peaking at number four, while reaching the top spot in Denmark and the UK.[35][37][36] \"Talking to the Moon\" became the fourth official single, only in Brazil, following its appearance on the soundtrack of the Brazilian telenovela Insensato Cora\u00e7\u00e3o (Irrational Heart) from 2011.[55] It reached the top position on Billboard Brasil's Hot Pop Songs and Hot 100 Airplay, spending several weeks on top of both charts.[56][57] \"Marry You\" was first released as an international single on August 22, 2011.[58] Although it was not released as a single in the US, it peaked at number 85 on the Hot 100 on January 15, 2011 due to strong digital sales (2.2 million sold as of 2015[update]) and entered in several charts worldwide.[35][37][59] In November 2011, \"Count On Me\" was released as the album's overall sixth single only in Australia, but charted in various regions.[37][60] Additionally, Mars recorded and composed with The Smeezingtons a song titled \"It Will Rain\", the first single for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1 film soundtrack (2011).[61] The song was released on iTunes on September 27, 2011.[62] It peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number two in New Zealand.[35][37] During this period, Mars appeared on a number of collaborative singles, including \"Lighters\", with American hip hop duo Bad Meets Evil, issued on July 5, 2011,[63] \"Mirror\", with American rapper Lil Wayne, released on September 13, 2011,[64] and \"Young, Wild & Free\" with American hip hop artists Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg, available for purchase on October 11, 2011.[65] The songs peaked at number four, sixteen, and seven on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively, and reached the top twenty of various music charts worldwide.[35][37] On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Hard Rock Casino for possession of cocaine. While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that what he did was \"foolish\" and that \"he has never used drugs before.\"[20] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course.[20][66] Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said: \"I was young, man! I was in f---ing Vegas...I wasn't thinking\". He added: \"I was given a number one record and I'm out doing dumb sh--.\" Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying \"I don't know where that came from\", adding: \"I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk. So a lot of that is a big blur, and I try every day to forget.\"[20] Mars started to promote his debut album as the opening act for American bands Maroon 5 and One Republic on the fall leg of the former act's Hands All Over Tour (2010\u201311). Later, on October 18, 2010, the singer began a co-headlined European concert tour with Travis McCoy that lasted until early November.[49] Doo-Wops & Hooligans received further promotion when the singer embarked on his first headlined concert tour, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, which ran from November 2010 to January 2012.[47][67] Most shows took place on smaller venues, such as theaters and ballrooms, which narrowed down Mars' income in the short term, since he rejected various offers to open for notable artists on arena tours, but led to create a substantial fan base.[68][69] At the 2011 Grammy Awards, Mars won his first Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Just the Way You Are\" and received other six nominations for his work: Best Rap Song, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Record of the Year for \"Nothin' on You\"; the latter category along with Song of the Year for \"Fuck You\" by CeeLo Green, and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical as part of The Smeezingtons.[70][71] At the 2012 Grammy Awards, Mars lost all the six categories in which he was nominated to British singer Adele. This included Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Doo-Wops & Hooligans, Best Pop Solo Performance, Record and Song of the Year for \"Grenade\", while Producer of the Year, Non-Classical as The Smeezingtons was lost to Paul Epworth.[72] During this time, Mars also won his first American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist, International Male Solo Artist at the Brit Awards and the Echo Award for Best International Male.[73][74] On March 22, 2012, it was announced that Mars had signed a worldwide publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis US.[75] In September 2012, when interviewed by Billboard magazine, Mars stated that his next album would be more musically varied and that he refused to \"pick a lane\", adding: \"I want to have the freedom and luxury to walk into a studio and say, 'Today I want to do a hip-hop, R&B, soul or rock record' \". He announced the album title, Unorthodox Jukebox, along with the ten songs which would make the final cut, as well as the title of the first single, \"Locked out of Heaven\", which would be released on October 1, 2012.[76] It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canada and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart.[35][45][36] It also charted within the top ten in various countries.[37] Unorthodox Jukebox, produced mainly by The Smeezingtons, was released on December 11, 2012, in the United States. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, but eventually peaked at number one on the chart.[76][77] It also charted at number one in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and in the United Kingdom, where it became the third fastest-selling album by a solo artist in 2012.[51][37][78] The album has since sold six million copies worldwide.[79] \"When I Was Your Man\" was released as the second single from Unorthodox Jukebox and also peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100;[35] with the feat, aside from Elvis Presley, no other male artist had achieved five number-one singles on the Hot 100 more quickly than Mars.[80] It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and was top ten in several countries worldwide.[36][37] The album's third single, \"Treasure\", peaked at number five in the United States, but had less commercial success worldwide than the previous two singles.[35][37] On May 24, 2013, Major Lazer issued a remix of \"Bubble Butt\" as the fourth single from their album Free the Universe, featuring Tyga, 2 Chainz, Mystic, and Mars on vocals.[81] In late 2013, \"Gorilla\"[82] and \"Young Girls\"[83] followed as the fourth and fifth singles from Unorthodox Jukebox, and reached the top 35 on the Hot 100.[35] Mars ran his second headlining concert tour, the Moonshine Jungle Tour, from June 2013 to October 2014. He also announced a concert residency titled Bruno Mars at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, Paradise, Nevada.[84][85] The tour grossed $156.4 million.[86][87] On September 8, 2013, Mars was disclosed as the headline performer at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which took place on February 2, 2014, with American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers as special guests.[88][89] It was the first Super Bowl halftime headlined by a performer under 30 in a decade.[90] It was the most watched halftime show in the history of the Super Bowl at that time, drawing a rating of 115.3 million viewers. The viewership for the halftime show was higher than that for the game.[91][92] At the 2014 Grammy Awards, Mars won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album for Unorthodox Jukebox. \"Locked Out of Heaven\" was nominated for Record and Song of the Year, while \"When I Was Your Man\" earned a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance.[93] In the same year, the album was recognized with the Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[94] Aside from his music career, Mars played the role of a singing Spix's macaw named Roberto in the film Rio 2, which was released in theaters on March 20, 2014.[95] He also contributed to the film's soundtrack with the song \"Welcome Back\".[96] In October 2014, British musician Mark Ronson announced his new single, \"Uptown Funk\", released on November 10, 2014, featurig Mars' vocals.[97] The song was a major commercial success, reaching number one in several countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand.[45][37] \"Uptown Funk\" spent a total of fourteen and seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, respectively.[35][36] Its success led it to become a worldwide phenomenon with major impact on pop culture.[98] In 2013, Mars was named Artist of the Year by Billboard and ranked number one on Forbes magazine's '30 Under 30' list, a tally of the brightest stars in 15 different fields under the age of 30 in the US.[99][100] After ending the Moonshine Jungle Tour, Mars began working on his third studio album, 24K Magic. He wrote on his Facebook page: \"Now it's time to start writing chapter 3\". The artist had not come up with a date for the release, stating: \"Until it's done ...

At that time, seven songs for the album had already been recorded.[114] In May 2016, the singer split with his manager, Brandon Creed, as the latter sold half his management company. Mars took his business affairs under his own management company, Gorilla Management, operated by Aaron Elharar.[28][115] In 2017, the corresponding edition of the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Mars as the \"First Male Artist to achieve three 10-million-selling-singles\".[116] \"24K Magic\" was released as the lead single from 24K Magic on October 7, 2016.[117] The single was promoted with a performance on Saturday Night Live and peaked at number four in the United States.[118][35] It reached the top spot in Belgium (Flanders), France and New Zealand.[37] In November, CBS broadcast an interview segment on 60 Minutes, presented by journalist Lara Logan, in which Mars talked about his new album and humble roots.

This playact had a major impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I\u2019m a fan.[13] He also impersonated Michael Jackson who is a major inspiration of his.[6] Mars was raised on his father's doo-wop collection \u2014 \"simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point\" and on Ventures, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Frankie Lymon, Little Anthony, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio, also influenced him.[4][145][146] Mars' musical style gravitated initially towards R&B since he was influenced by artists such as Keith Sweat, Jodeci, and R. Kelly.[147] As a child he also took notice of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Teddy Riley and Babyface.[148] At the same time, he also listened to 1950s rock 'n' roll, doo-wop music, and Motown.[147] In high school, he listened to classic rock groups such as Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles, whose influences can be heard in Mars' work,[147] as well as singers with high voices, like Stevie Wonder and Freddie Mercury.[149] Bob Marley, and local bands in Hawaii, were a major influence and account for his reggae roots.[150] Hip-hop acts like Jay-Z, The Roots, and Cody Chesnutt were among some of Mars' favourites, and have influenced his composition skills.[147] Each of these musical genres has influenced Mars' musical style; he observed that: \"It's not easy to [create] songs with that mixture of rock and soul and hip-hop, and there's only a handful of them.\"[147] Mars also admires classical music.[151] Other artists Mars has said inspired his work include: Janet Jackson,[152] Jimi Hendrix,[147][151] Amy Winehouse,[153] Sly Stone, Carlos Santana, George Clinton, and Usher.[151][154] Mars has also stated that he is a fan of: Alicia Keys, Jessie J, Jack White, The Saturdays, and Kings of Leon.[155] Mars' music has been noted for displaying a wide variety of styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop,[156] R&B,[157] funk,[158] soul,[159] reggae,[156] hip hop,[160] and rock.[161] His debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, is predominantly a pop and R&B record, influence by most of the genres mentioned above.[156][157][159] His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul, as well as balladry.[161][162] Lyrically, the album is different from the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality.[163][164] The explicit content in the song \"Gorilla\" caused a controversy in Australia.[165] Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect \"feel-good\", carefree, and optimistic sentiments.[166][167] However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour.[159][168] Mars' third album, 24K Magic, was significantly influenced by R&B, funk and soul music.[158][169] Lyrically, the album involves themes of money and sex.[170] Mars has explained his writing process: \"I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', since \"You can\u2019t force creativeness\" as inspiration comes out of the blue in different places. Ideas occur suddenly to him; and occasionally, he is able to materialize them into lyrics.[102] Mars claims that his work with other artists has influenced his musical style: \"Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's Just the Way You Are. If you know my story, you know I love all different genres of music.\"[171] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: \"In Hawaii some of the biggest radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first.\"[150] Philip Lawrence, one of his music partners from The Smeezingtons, stated: \"What people don't know is there's a darker underbelly to Bruno Mars.\" Nevertheless, most of his music is romantic and Mars himself says: \"I blame that on me singing to girls back in high school\".[38] Mars possesses a three octave tenor vocal range.[162] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that he is one of the most \"versatile and accessible singers in pop, with a light, soul-influenced voice that's an easy fit in a range of styles, a universal donor\",[160] while Tim Sendra from AllMusic described Mars' vocals on Doo-Wops & Hooligans as \"the kind of smooth instrument that slips into your ear like honey.\"[172] Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone called Mars a \"nimble, soulful vocalist\" on Unorthodox Jukebox. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Mars' voice due to \"the purity, cream and range of mid-period Michael Jackson\" in a review of a concert promoting Unorthodox Jukebox.[173] On 24K Magic, Consequence of Sound's Karen Gwen afirmed that Mars showed his \"pips\" and pushed his vocals to the limit. She described his voice as a \"clear, unapologetic tenor\" being a \"blessing\" nowadays.[174] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found 24K Magic to show Mars' vocal ability from tenderness to \"the more forceful side of his voice\".[175] Mars is also able to play drums,[176][177] guitar,[177][178] keyboard,[178] bass,[177] and piano.[80][178] Mars usually plays the instrumentation or part of it, on his albums and on the songs he composes for other artists.[177][179] Mars is known for his retro showmanship which is widely acclaimed by tour critics and reviewers.[180][181][182] Deanna Ramsay of The Jakarta Post described Mars as a \"truly global star\".[183] Boston Herald's Jim Sullivan compared Mars' shownmaship to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley.[180] Kevin Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called Mars a \"consummate performer.\"[184] The Boston Globe's Sarah Rodman said that Mars shows an \"indefatigable ecstatic approach to performing\" and \"classic showmanship.\"[181] In the same vein, Jim Farber of the Daily News stated of the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVIII that Mars \"brings old-school showmanship to dynamic performance.\"[182] The singer took its inspiration by playing videotapes of Elvis, James Brown and Michael Jackson when he was younger. Nowadays, before the shows, he watches Brown's T.A.M.I. Show, James Hendrix's Live at Woodstock or Prince performing \"Purple Rain\" (1984).[4] During The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, Ara Jansan from The West Australian called the performance \"one of the most creative and exciting displays of musical artistry\" she had witnessed in a long time and noticed the concert attracted a wide-ranging audience of all age groups.[185] The Oregonian's Robert Ham explained that the singer not only grabbed the spectators' attention throughout the entire concert, but he also sang every note by himself with noticeable guitar skills.[186] On the Moonshine Jungle Tour, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described Mars' performance as \"entertaining ... keeping smiles plastered on the faces of his onlookers, and he does a better job at it than almost anyone working in music right now\".[187] Rolling Stone magazine placed Mars at number 35 on its list of 50 Best Live Acts Right Now in 2013; \"Anyone from the age of 5 to 95 can walk out of a Bruno Mars concert feeling like the show was designed just for them. Mars walks the old-school walk and talks the sexy talk, but he also nails the hits, leads a super-energetic nine-piece soul band, and rips a mean drum solo\".[188] NFL executives Sarah Moll and Tracy Perlman stated that: \"If you go to his concerts, it's 11-year-old girls to 65-year-old women\u2014it's everyone\", after seeing The Moonshine Jungle tour several times during the summer of 2013.[99] Mars' concerts feature The Hooligans, a band that includes: a guitarist, bassist, drummer, keyboardist, and a horn section. They also serve as dancers and background singers.[184][189] Critics noted the difference the backup band and the arrangements made to the sound of the live versions of the songs compared to those on the album.[185][190] Mars' shows feature all-band choreographed dancing arrangements, which include footwork that is inspired by James Brown and the splits.[188][191][192] His shows are heavily influenced by the disco era with a soul revue-inspired set.[184][182] In addition, long, mellow, and soft interludes that echo the smooth contemporary R&B style which was popular during the 1990s are also part of the show.[184][189] His set list blends several genres of music such as: pop, doo-wop, funk, R&B, soul and reggae.[184][181] His first two headlining concert tours included various covers.[187][190] Mars' shows usually feature pyrotechnics, strobe and laser lighting,[181][184] and he typically plays the drums and guitar.[181][184] In 2011, Mars appears in two commercials for Bench as part of their clothing line \"Bench On Mars\" and \"Bruno Mars Gets Khaki in Bench\".[197] On May 12, 2013, Mars tweeted a picture of himself using an electronic cigarette. On May 30, 2013, a press release was published reporting Mars' investment in the NJOY Electronic Cigarette Company, \"in order to quit smoking for his mother\", since the singer \"believes in the product and the company's mission.\"[198] In 2014, Bruno Mars teamed up with three partners to launch the \"Selvarey Rum\" brand which includes Selvarey White, made of blended three and five-year aged Panamanian rums and the five-year-old rum flavored with chocolate, Selvarey Cacao.[199] In the same year, Mars decided to invest in Chromatik, which makes digital versions of sheet music for the web and iPad. Mars said: \"I love that Chromatik will bring better music education into schools\" ... \"[a]nd I'm happy to be a part of it.\"[200] On February 26, 2014, it was announced that Mars had partnered with the Hawai'i Community Foundation and the GRAMMY Foundation to establish a GRAMMY Camp Scholarship Fund, in order to support the next generation of music makers with funds to provide financial assistance for qualified needs-based applicants from Hawaii.[201] On September 27, 2017, Mars expanded his camp scholarship in order to include applicants from all over the United States. The singer established the partnership in honor of his mother.[202] A day before a concert in the Philippines Mars donated $100,000 (US) to the orphans of Bantay Bata, who were among the victims of Typhoon Haiyan, in order to raise the morale of those who lost their families and homes.[203][204] Mars performed at the Make It Right gala, whose campaign goal is to \"help build homes for people in need.\"[205] He also performed at the Robin Hood Foundation's 2014 annual benefit in New York, whose goal is to \"fight poverty in New York City by supporting more than 200 nonprofits with financial and technical assistance.\"[206] In 2017, Mars donated 1 million dollars from the show at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan to help the victims of the Flint water crisis.[207] The singer participated in the \"Somos Una Voz\" relief initiative, created by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, in order to help survivors of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Mexico's 7.1 earthquake.[208] In November 2018, Mars donated 24,000 meals in aid to the Salvation Army Hawaiian & Pacific Islands Division's 48th annual Thanksgiving Dinner.[209] Bruno Mars has earned numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including eleven Grammy Awards,[210] three Brit Awards,[211] four Guinness World Record[116][212][213] nine American and 10 Soul Train Music Awards.[214][215] In 2011, Mars made Time magazine's 100 list, while his former songwriting and record producing team, The Smeezingtons, earned several accolades.[216][217][218] At the 2018 Grammys, Mars became the second artist to win Record and Song of the Year with two different songs from the same album.[219] In 2019, Billboard placed him on number 41 of its list of Greatest of All Time Artists and was number 14 on the list of Top Touring Artists of the 2010s decade.[220][221] In the same year, iHeartRadio Canada placed Mars on theirs \"Icons of the Decade\" of the 2010s.[222] Mars' \"When I Was Your Man\" became the second number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 to feature exclusively piano and vocals.[223] He is the first male artist to place two titles as a lead act in the Hot 100's top 10 simultaneously.[224] In total, he has had seven number-one singles on the Hot 100 chart.[35] In 2018, Mars matched Beyonce and Mariah Carey as the only artists with three Top Five singles on the Billboard Hot 100 from their first three studio albums.[225] In the same year, he became the first solo male artist with nine number ones on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart.[226] Mars, Ed Sheeran and Jewel are the only artists with two songs to spend at least half a year on the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10.[227] According to the International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI), \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Grenade\" are two of the most successful digital singles of all time, with sales of 12.5 million and 10.2 million, respectively. This contributed to Mars becoming the biggest selling artist of 2012.[228] His songs \"Just The Way You Are\", \"Grenade\", \"Locked Out Of Heaven\", and \"When I Was Your Man\" have each sold over 4 million digital copies, making him the first male artist to do so as a lead singer.[229] Six of his singles are counted among the best-selling singles of all time.[230] As of 2016[update] and 2018, the singer has sold 26 million albums and over 200 million singles worldwide, respectively.[148][231] Due to the ticket reselling which occurred during the week after Mars' performance at the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping.[232] The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.[233] However, the bill died at the conference committee.[234] Mars's brother, Eric, has continuously served as the drummer for his backup band, The Hooligans. Their sisters, Tiara, Tahiti, and Presley, as well as their cousin Jaime, make up the all-girl music group The Lylas. When she was young, Jamie moved in with the siblings due to parental issues.[235] Mars began dating model Jessica Caban in 2011.[236] The two remain a couple as of 2019[update], residing together in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills with a Rottweiler named \"Geronimo\".[148] Mars returned from an overseas gig in May 2013 when he learned in the Los Angeles airport that his mother was gravely ill. He immediately got on a plane to Hawaii. His mother died the next day.[148] On June 2, 2013, a publicist for Atlantic Records confirmed to the Associated Press that Mars' mother had suffered a brain aneurysm. She had died on Saturday, June 1, 2013, at age 55, at Queens Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii.[237][238] Later, on June 7, 2013, the singer wrote about the loss of his mother on Twitter: \"So thankful for all the love during the most difficult time in my life. I'll be back on my feet again soon. That's what mom wants, she told me.\"[239] In 2013, Mars told Rolling Stone that record executives \"had trouble categorizing him\", as they were clueless which radio stations would play his songs, and which people (black or white) were going to buy his albums.[4] In the same month, he confessed that \"Nothin' on You\" was rejected by a \"music industry decision-maker\" because of his race. That experience made him feel like a \"mutant\", and he says that was his lowest point. \"Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room.\"[240] In 2018, Mars was accused during The Grapevine, a series which explores African-American issues, of cultural appropriation on social media for using his racial ambiguity to profit from black music, and was criticized for mimicking the sound of past artists. Various black celebrities, including Stevie Wonder, Charlie Wilson, 9th Wonder, Marjua Estevez, and Stereo Williams dismissed the accusations.[241][242][243] Mars has spoken often about his influences and has given credit to several black artists, such as Babyface, Teddy Riley, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis.[241][244] On January 28, 2014, Demetrius Orlandus Proctor filed a lawsuit, claiming he holds the copyright for the Travie McCoy and Mars' track \"Billionaire\". Proctor claimed he owned the copyright to the music and lyrics of the track since March 31, 2011, though the song was released a year before. As evidence, Proctor has submitted a United States Copyright Office registration certificate for \"Frisky Vol. 1 to 30 (Tapes)\", issued in 2000. Proctor accused McCoy and Mars of \"willful and intentional\" infringe copyright, seeking the destruction of all copies of the recording. Proctor claims he has exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the song.[245] Mark Ronson and Mars' \"Uptown Funk\" has received various accusations and lawsuits over copyright infringement. In 2015, similarities with \"Oops Up Side Your Head\" (1979) by The Gap Band led them, along with keyboardist Rudolph Taylor, and producer Lonnie Simmons to be added as co-writers of \"Uptown Funk\" and receive publishing royalties.[246] In the same year, Serbian artist Viktorija argued that \"Uptown Funk\" infringed on one of her tracks. She decided not to sue Mars and Ronson.[247] In 2016, electro-funk band Collage sued Ronson and Mars for copying their single, \"Young Girls\" (1983), while The Sequence, a rap group, claimed it infringed their single \"Funk You Up\" (1979) and sued a year later.[248][249] In 2017, Lastrada Entertainment filed a lawsuit due to similarities with \"More Bounce to the Ounce\" (1980) by Zapp. The company seeks damage, a jury trial and prevent Ronson from profiting with \"Uptown Funk\".[250] In 2018, the Collage and Zapp lawsuit were dropped, it was not revealed if there was any financial settlement.[251][252] \"Treasure\" was re-registered with new writing credits, which included Thibaut Berland and Christopher Khan, due to the similarities with Breakbot's \"Baby I'm Yours\".[253] Billboard estimated Mars' earnings around $18,839,681, making him the twelfth highest paid musician of 2013.[254] Forbes magazine began reporting on Bruno Mars' earnings in 2014, calculating that the $60\u00a0million earned between June 2013 to June 2014, for his music and tour, which made him thirteenth on the list of the Celebrity 100 list.[255] In June 2017, Mars ranked at sixth on the Forbes World's Highest Paid Celebrities, earning an estimated $39 million throughout June 2016 \u2013 June 2017.[256] In July 2018, Forbes announced that Mars was America's highest-paid musician of 2017, with an estimated total of $100 million. This, in turn, placed him at number 11 on the Celebrity 100 list as well as being his highest yearly earnings to date.[115] In 2019, he was placed at number 54 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, with estimated earnings of $51.5 million throughout June 1, 2018, and June 1, 2019.[257] Studio albums",

He is known for his stage performances, retro showmanship, and for performing in a wide range of musical styles, including Pop, R&amp;B, funk, soul, reggae, hip hop, and rock. Mars is accompanied by his band, The Hooligans, who play a variety of instruments, such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums, and horns, and also serve as backup singers and dancers.\nBorn and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mars moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career. After being dropped by Motown Records, Mars signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2009. In the same year, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for various successful singles for Mars himself and other artists. Mars rose to fame in 2010 with the release of the successful singles \"Nothin' on You\" by B.o.B and \"Billionaire\" by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals on the hooks. His debut studio album Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans (2010) spawned the international number-one singles \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Grenade\", and \"The Lazy Song\". The former won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. \nMars' second album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), became his first number one album on the US Billboard 200 and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Its singles \"Locked Out of Heaven\" and \"When I Was Your Man\", reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 2014, Mars collaborated with Mark Ronson on \"Uptown Funk\", which topped many music charts worldwide and won Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 2016 Grammy Awards. In 2016, Mars co-founded the production team Shampoo Press &amp; Curl, who replaced The Smeezingtons on the composition of his third studio album, the R&amp;B-focused, 24K Magic. The record received seven Grammy Awards, winning the major categories of Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year. The album also yielded the successful singles \"24K Magic\", \"That's What I Like\", and \"Finesse\".\nMars has sold over 200 million singles and 26 million albums worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has released seven number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 since his career launched in 2010, attaining his first five faster than any male artist since Elvis Presley. As a songwriter, he was included in Music Week and Billboard magazine as one of the best songwriters of 2011 and 2013, respectively. Mars has received several awards and nominations, including 11 Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine American Music Awards, 10 Soul Train Awards and holds three Guinness World Records. He has appeared in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and Forbes magazine's lists of '30 under 30' in 2013, and Celebrity 100 in 2014, 2018 and 2019.\nPeter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot, and was raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu.[1][2] His father is of half Puerto Rican and half Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Ukraine and Hungary), and is originally from Brooklyn, New York.[2][3][4] His mother emigrated from the Philippines to Hawaii as a child, and was of Filipino, and some Spanish, ancestry.[2][3] His parents met while performing in a show in which his mother was a hula dancer and his father played percussion.[4] At the age of two, he was nicknamed \"Bruno\" by his father because of his resemblance to professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino.[5][6]\nMars is one of six children and came from a musical family which exposed him to a diverse mix of music genres, including reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&amp;B.[7][8] His mother was both a singer and a dancer, and his father performed Little Richard rock and roll music.[4][9] Mars' uncle was an Elvis impersonator, and also encouraged three-year-old Mars to perform on stage. Mars performed songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations.[6] At the age of four, Mars began performing five days a week with his family's band, The Love Notes, and became known in Hawaii for his impersonation of Elvis Presley.[10] When he was five he peed himself during a performance of Elvis' \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (1961), which led his parents to think they could be making a mistake. However, Mars never quited.[4] In 1990, Mars was featured in the Hawaiian tabloid shopper MidWeek as \"Little Elvis\" and performed in the halftime show of the 1990 Aloha Bowl.[6][11]\nIn 1992, he appeared in a cameo role in the film Honeymoon in Vegas and was interviewed by Pauly Shore on MTV. When Mars was six years-old, he was featured on The Arsenio Hall Show and throughout grade school, he performed with his family's band, two shows a night, covering Frankie Lymon and Little Anthony, as well. When he was a child he had a small version of a drum set, guitar, piano and some percussion and learned to play the instruments. By age 12, his parents divorced, thus ending The Love Notes act. His father's various businesses, that ranged from temporary-tattoo parlor to memorabilia shops, failed. Consequently, there was no longer a steady source of income. He moved out of his parents' house along with his brother and father. They lived in the \"slums of Hawaii\", on the back of a car, on rooftops, and in an abandoned bird zoo, Paradise Park, where Mars' father worked before it closed.[4][12] The singer had to move to a new schools and initially he was bullied, but he became popular in his last school days.[4]\nNevertheless, the time Mars spent impersonating Presley had a major impact on his musical evolution and performing techniques.[13] He later began playing guitar after being inspired by American rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix.[14] In 2010, he also acknowledged his Hawaiian roots and musical family as an influence, explaining: \"Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments... I've just been surrounded by it.\"[15][2] When he attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu he sung in a group called The School Boys, who did several shows including opening for Mars' father new band. The singer, while in high school, passed for the big time of Hawaiian entertainment, becoming the opening gig for a huge magic show and impersonating Michael Jackson in a celebrity-impersonators show, making $75 for performance.[4][16]\nAfter Mars' sister in Los Angeles, California played his demo for Mike Lynn, (the head of A&amp;R at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment record label), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles.[17] In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career.[6][18] At that time, he lived on Mansfield and remembers trying to park his car and finding the parking space with a homeless guy, \"taking a shit\", with \"no toilet paper, nothing! It was just foul, and no one cleaned it up.\"[4] He adopted his stage name from the childhood nickname his father gave him, adding \"Mars\" at the end because: \"I felt like I didn't have [any] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I\u2019m out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars.\"[19] Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also an effort to \"avoid being stereotyped\", as the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latin artist. They even tried to convince Mars to sing in Spanish.[20]\n\u2014Mars, speaking about his experiences of moving to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career.[21]\nShortly after moving to Los Angeles, Mars signed a record contract with Motown Records in 2004, but the deal \"went nowhere\", leading him to have a conversation with will.i.am's management, which also turned out to be fruitless.[22][20] However, the singer's experience with Motown proved to be beneficial to his career. Songwriter Philip Lawrence was also signed to the label.[22]\n\nAfter Mars was dropped by the label less than a year after being signed, he stayed in Los Angeles and landed a music publishing deal in 2005 with American record producer Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent.[23][17] \u2014Cameron Strang, speaking about developing Mars' career.[17]\n Lindsey showed Mars and fellow songwriters Brody Brown and Jeff Bhasker (who Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music and acted as a mentor, helping them to hone their craft.[17][24][25] Bhasker explained that Lindsey would \"mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because you can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline.\"[25][23] In a different interview Brown corroborated this story.[24] During this time, Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in a band called Sex Panther with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez (Mars' brother), who eventually became the drummer of Mars' main band, The Hooligans.[17][26]\nWhen Philip Lawrence was first told he should meet Mars he was reluctant to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, drummer for the American musical group The Black Eyed Peas, told Lawrence: \"Whatever it costs you to get out here, I'll reimburse you.\" Lawrence responded: \"Just give me five dollars back for the bus.\"[27] The pair began collaborating, writing songs for Mars, but they received many rejections from record labels. On the verge of giving up, they received a call from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited Menudo. He liked their song \"Lost\", which was written for Mars. The duo did not want to give the song away, but when they were offered $20,000 for it, they agreed. The sale of this song allowed them to continue working,[27] and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs together for other artists.[17] Eventually, Creed became Mars' manager for nine years.[27][28]\nIn 2006, Lawrence introduced Mars to his future A&amp;R manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck.[29] After hearing him play a couple of songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt it was too early and that he still needed to develop as an artist.[23][29]\nBefore becoming a successful solo artist, Mars was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for the likes of Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, Sean Kingston, and Flo Rida.[7][21] He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song \"Get Sexy\" (2009) and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7 (2010).[30] His first recorded appearance as a singer was on Far East Movement's second studio album, Animal, on the track \"3D\" (2009).[31] He was also featured on American pastor and hip hop artist Jaeson Ma's debut single \"Love\" in August 2009 and on Travie McCoy's \"One At a Time\" (2009), a charity single for MTV's Staying Alive foundation.[32][33][34] He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on, and composing (as part of the production group The Smeezingtons) B.o.B's \"Nothin' on You\" (2009) and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\" (2010); both songs peaked within the top ten of many music charts worldwide, with the former charting at number one on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.[35][36][37]\nMars said of these successful singles: \"I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of \"Nothin' on You\", it might've sounded like some '90s R&amp;B.\"[38] Then, on May 11, 2010, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand.[39] The EP peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200 US albums chart and a music video was released for the song \"The Other Side\" featuring CeeLo Green and B.o.B.[40][41] Mars, under The Smeezingtons, composed Green's single \"Fuck You\" (2010).[42]\nAfter serving as guest vocalist on B.o.B's and Travie McCoy's singles,[43] Mars released \"Just the Way You Are\" on July 20, 2010.[44] The song was the lead single from his debut studio album, Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans (2010), and reached number one in the US, Canada, the UK,[35][45][36] and several other countries worldwide.[37] The song holds the record as the longest-reigning debut adult contemporary format hit, spending twenty weeks atop the Adult Contemporary chart in the United States.[46] Mars also released two promotional singles, \"Liquor Store Blues\" featuring Damian Marley and \"Grenade\", before confirming the latter as the album's second single on October 21, 2010.[47][48] \"Grenade\" also reached number one on the US Hot 100, Canada, and the UK.[35][45][36] It was also successful on other international charts.[37] The album, released on October 5, 2010, in the United States, debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 55,000 copies in its first week of release in the US.[49][50] It charted at number one in Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other international album charts.[51][36][37] Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans received generally positive reviews from music critics and has since sold six million copies worldwide.[52][53] In February 2011, \"The Lazy Song\" was released as the third single from Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans[54] and became the album's third consecutive top-five hit on the Hot 100, peaking at number four, while reaching the top spot in Denmark and the UK.[35][37][36]\n\"Talking to the Moon\" became the fourth official single, only in Brazil, following its appearance on the soundtrack of the Brazilian telenovela Insensato Cora\u00e7\u00e3o (Irrational Heart) from 2011.[55] It reached the top position on Billboard Brasil's Hot Pop Songs and Hot 100 Airplay, spending several weeks on top of both charts.[56][57] \"Marry You\" was first released as an international single on August 22, 2011.[58] Although it was not released as a single in the US, it peaked at number 85 on the Hot 100 on January 15, 2011 due to strong digital sales (2.2 million sold as of 2015[update]) and entered in several charts worldwide.[35][37][59] In November 2011, \"Count On Me\" was released as the album's overall sixth single only in Australia, but charted in various regions.[37][60] Additionally, Mars recorded and composed with The Smeezingtons a song titled \"It Will Rain\", the first single for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1 film soundtrack (2011).[61] The song was released on iTunes on September 27, 2011.[62] It peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number two in New Zealand.[35][37] During this period, Mars appeared on a number of collaborative singles, including \"Lighters\", with American hip hop duo Bad Meets Evil, issued on July 5, 2011,[63] \"Mirror\", with American rapper Lil Wayne, released on September 13, 2011,[64] and \"Young, Wild &amp; Free\" with American hip hop artists Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg, available for purchase on October 11, 2011.[65] The songs peaked at number four, sixteen, and seven on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively, and reached the top twenty of various music charts worldwide.[35][37]\nOn September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Hard Rock Casino for possession of cocaine. While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that what he did was \"foolish\" and that \"he has never used drugs before.\"[20] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course.[20][66] Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said: \"I was young, man! I was in f---ing Vegas...I wasn't thinking\". He added: \"I was given a number one record and I'm out doing dumb sh--.\" Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying \"I don't know where that came from\", adding: \"I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk. So a lot of that is a big blur, and I try every day to forget.\"[20]\nMars started to promote his debut album as the opening act for American bands Maroon 5 and One Republic on the fall leg of the former act's Hands All Over Tour (2010\u201311). Later, on October 18, 2010, the singer began a co-headlined European concert tour with Travis McCoy that lasted until early November.[49] Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans received further promotion when the singer embarked on his first headlined concert tour, The Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans Tour, which ran from November 2010 to January 2012.[47][67] Most shows took place on smaller venues, such as theaters and ballrooms, which narrowed down Mars' income in the short term, since he rejected various offers to open for notable artists on arena tours, but led to create a substantial fan base.[68][69]\nAt the 2011 Grammy Awards, Mars won his first Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Just the Way You Are\" and received other six nominations for his work: Best Rap Song, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Record of the Year for \"Nothin' on You\"; the latter category along with Song of the Year for \"Fuck You\" by CeeLo Green, and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical as part of The Smeezingtons.[70][71] At the 2012 Grammy Awards, Mars lost all the six categories in which he was nominated to British singer Adele. This included Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans, Best Pop Solo Performance, Record and Song of the Year for \"Grenade\", while Producer of the Year, Non-Classical as The Smeezingtons was lost to Paul Epworth.[72] During this time, Mars also won his first American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist, International Male Solo Artist at the Brit Awards and the Echo Award for Best International Male.[73][74]\nOn March 22, 2012, it was announced that Mars had signed a worldwide publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis US.[75] In September 2012, when interviewed by Billboard magazine, Mars stated that his next album would be more musically varied and that he refused to \"pick a lane\", adding: \"I want to have the freedom and luxury to walk into a studio and say, 'Today I want to do a hip-hop, R&amp;B, soul or rock record' \". He announced the album title, Unorthodox Jukebox, along with the ten songs which would make the final cut, as well as the title of the first single, \"Locked out of Heaven\", which would be released on October 1, 2012.[76] It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canada and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart.[35][45][36] It also charted within the top ten in various countries.[37]\nUnorthodox Jukebox, produced mainly by The Smeezingtons, was released on December 11, 2012, in the United States. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, but eventually peaked at number one on the chart.[76][77] It also charted at number one in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and in the United Kingdom, where it became the third fastest-selling album by a solo artist in 2012.[51][37][78] The album has since sold six million copies worldwide.[79] \"When I Was Your Man\" was released as the second single from Unorthodox Jukebox and also peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100;[35] with the feat, aside from Elvis Presley, no other male artist had achieved five number-one singles on the Hot 100 more quickly than Mars.[80] It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and was top ten in several countries worldwide.[36][37] The album's third single, \"Treasure\", peaked at number five in the United States, but had less commercial success worldwide than the previous two singles.[35][37] On May 24, 2013, Major Lazer issued a remix of \"Bubble Butt\" as the fourth single from their album Free the Universe, featuring Tyga, 2 Chainz, Mystic, and Mars on vocals.[81] In late 2013, \"Gorilla\"[82] and \"Young Girls\"[83] followed as the fourth and fifth singles from Unorthodox Jukebox, and reached the top 35 on the Hot 100.[35]\nMars ran his second headlining concert tour, the Moonshine Jungle Tour, from June 2013 to October 2014. He also announced a concert residency titled Bruno Mars at The Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, Paradise, Nevada.[84][85] The tour grossed $156.4 million.[86][87] On September 8, 2013, Mars was disclosed as the headline performer at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which took place on February 2, 2014, with American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers as special guests.[88][89] It was the first Super Bowl halftime headlined by a performer under 30 in a decade.[90] It was the most watched halftime show in the history of the Super Bowl at that time, drawing a rating of 115.3 million viewers. The viewership for the halftime show was higher than that for the game.[91][92]\nAt the 2014 Grammy Awards, Mars won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album for Unorthodox Jukebox. \"Locked Out of Heaven\" was nominated for Record and Song of the Year, while \"When I Was Your Man\" earned a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance.[93] In the same year, the album was recognized with the Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[94] Aside from his music career, Mars played the role of a singing Spix's macaw named Roberto in the film Rio 2, which was released in theaters on March 20, 2014.[95] He also contributed to the film's soundtrack with the song \"Welcome Back\".[96] In October 2014, British musician Mark Ronson announced his new single, \"Uptown Funk\", released on November 10, 2014, featurig Mars' vocals.[97] The song was a major commercial success, reaching number one in several countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand.[45][37] \"Uptown Funk\" spent a total of fourteen and seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, respectively.[35][36] Its success led it to become a worldwide phenomenon with major impact on pop culture.[98] In 2013, Mars was named Artist of the Year by Billboard and ranked number one on Forbes magazine's '30 Under 30' list, a tally of the brightest stars in 15 different fields under the age of 30 in the US.[99][100]\nAfter ending the Moonshine Jungle Tour, Mars began working on his third studio album, 24K Magic. He wrote on his Facebook page: \"Now it's time to start writing chapter 3\". The artist had not come up with a date for the release, stating: \"Until it's done ... It's gotta be just as good if not better\".[101] In March 2015, the artist provided some details of the new album on the Chinese magazine that's Shanghai, confirming Mark Ronson and Jeff Bhasker as producers. Mars stated he wanted to improve his songwriting, shows, music videos, and make a better album than the previous two.[102] In the same year, Mars (as part of The Smeezingtons) composed \"All I Ask\", a track from Adele's album 25.[103] Their work with Adele brought Mars a Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards.[104]\nOn December 2, 2015, it was announced that British rock band Coldplay would be headlining the Super Bowl 50 halftime show on February 7, 2016.[105] Mars and Beyonc\u00e9 were guest acts, marking their second time appearing on the Super Bowl halftime. They are surpassed by Gloria Estefan and Justin Timberlake, with three appearances each.[106][107] The halftime show became one of the most watched in Super Bowl history.[108] At the 2016 Grammy Awards, Ronson and Mars' single, \"Uptown Funk\", won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year.[109] In the same year, it was reported that Mars was working with bass player Jamareo Artis, engineer Charles Moniz, musician Brody Brown, singer-songwriter Andrew Wyatt and EDM producer Skrillex.[24][110][111] Moniz confirmed the album was close to being finished and Artis claimed it was set to be released in 2016.[112][113] The album was to be issued in March, but Mars' appearance at the Super Bowl halftime show led the release to be postponed several months. At that time, seven songs for the album had already been recorded.[114] In May 2016, the singer split with his manager, Brandon Creed, as the latter sold half his management company. Mars took his business affairs under his own management company, Gorilla Management, operated by Aaron Elharar.[28][115] In 2017, the corresponding edition of the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Mars as the \"First Male Artist to achieve three 10-million-selling-singles\".[116]\n\"24K Magic\" was released as the lead single from 24K Magic on October 7, 2016.[117] The single was promoted with a performance on Saturday Night Live and peaked at number four in the United States.[118][35] It reached the top spot in Belgium (Flanders), France and New Zealand.[37] In November, CBS broadcast an interview segment on 60 Minutes, presented by journalist Lara Logan, in which Mars talked about his new album and humble roots. This was his first television appearance in four years.[119] 24K Magic, released on November 18, 2016, debuted at number two on the album charts of the United States, Canada, France and New Zealand.[120][51][37] It received positive reviews from music critics and was composed mainly by Shampoo Press &amp; Curl, a production team consisting of Mars, Philip Lawrence and Brody Brown, which replaced The Smeezingtons.[121][122] \"That's What I Like\" was released as the album's second single on January 30, 2017 and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[123][35] However, it had less success in international markets.[37] In June, the original version and a remix with French DJ David Guetta of \"Versace on the Floor\" were issued as the album's third single.[124][125] It reached the top 35 of the Hot 100.[35] In November, \"Chunky\" was announced as the album's fourth single only in Australia.[126] Lastly, \"Finesse\", remixed to feature American rapper Cardi B, was released as the last single from 24K Magic on January 4, 2018.[127] It became a top-three single on the Hot 100 and Canada, while reaching number two in New Zealand and entering the top ten of Australia, Belgium and Netherlands.[35][45][37]\nIn late 2016, the singer started his second concert residency at the Park MGM's Park Theatre to end in 2020.[128][129] He also announced his third headlining concert tour, the 24K Magic World Tour, which began in March 2017 and ended in December 2018. The tour grossed more than $300 million worldwide.[115] On September 12, 2017, it was confirmed that Mars would be starring in his first TV concert special, titled Bruno Mars: 24K Magic Live at the Apollo, a one-hour special, which aired on CBS on November 29, 2017.[130] Mars received seven awards at the 2017 American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year, two for \"That's What I Like\" and other two for his album 24K Magic.[131] He also won Album/Mixtape of the Year at the 2017 Soul Train Music Awards, in addition to four other awards at the ceremony.[132] At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Mars won in the six categories for which he was nominated: Album of the Year and Best R&amp;B Album for 24K Magic, Record of the Year for the title track and Song of The Year, Best R&amp;B Performance and Best R&amp;B Song for \"That's What I Like\". 24K Magic also won a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, for the work of the album's engineers.[133] In the same year, Mars won several awards in R&amp;B categories at the Billboard and iHeartRadio Music Awards.[134][135]\nIn early 2018, according to singer Jackie Jackson, Mars had worked on Michael Jackson's music.[136] However, Mars denied any involvement in Jackson's music.[137] The artist worked on Chic's studio album It\u2019s About Time (2018), but the song is expected to be featured on Chic's next studio album, according to musician Nile Rodgers.[138][139] \"Wake Up in the Sky\" is a collaborative single, issued in September 2018, between American rappers Gucci Mane and Kodak Black, along with Mars.[140] It peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.[35] On February 15, 2019, Cardi B and Mars released a single together called \"Please Me\".[141] It peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100.[35] The single also reached the top 20 of Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.[45][36][37] Five months later, British pop singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, American country singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton, and Mars released a single titled \"Blow\" for the former's fourth album, No.6 Collaborations Project (2019).[142] On October 16, 2019, Mars posted a picture, on his Twitter, of himself in a recording studio, possibly indicating new solo music.[143] Hugh McIntyre from Forbes addmited that the singer's next studio album is due for a release in 2020.[144]\n\nAs a child, Mars spent time impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact had a major impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those\nguys and I love studying them because I\u2019m a fan.[13] He also impersonated Michael Jackson who is a major inspiration of his.[6] Mars was raised on his father's doo-wop collection \u2014 \"simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point\" and on Ventures, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Frankie Lymon, Little Anthony, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio, also influenced him.[4][145][146]\nMars' musical style gravitated initially towards R&amp;B since he was influenced by artists such as Keith Sweat, Jodeci, and R. Kelly.[147] As a child he also took notice of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Teddy Riley and Babyface.[148] At the same time, he also listened to 1950s rock 'n' roll, doo-wop music, and Motown.[147] In high school, he listened to classic rock groups such as Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles, whose influences can be heard in Mars' work,[147] as well as singers with high voices, like Stevie Wonder and Freddie Mercury.[149] Bob Marley, and local bands in Hawaii, were a major influence and account for his reggae roots.[150] Hip-hop acts like Jay-Z, The Roots, and Cody Chesnutt were among some of Mars' favourites, and have influenced his composition skills.[147] Each of these musical genres has influenced Mars' musical style; he observed that: \"It's not easy to [create] songs with that mixture of rock and soul and hip-hop, and there's only a handful of them.\"[147] Mars also admires classical music.[151]\nOther artists Mars has said inspired his work include: Janet Jackson,[152] Jimi Hendrix,[147][151] Amy Winehouse,[153] Sly Stone, Carlos Santana, George Clinton, and Usher.[151][154] Mars has also stated that he is a fan of: Alicia Keys, Jessie J, Jack White, The Saturdays, and Kings of Leon.[155]\nMars' music has been noted for displaying a wide variety of styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop,[156] R&amp;B,[157] funk,[158] soul,[159] reggae,[156] hip hop,[160] and rock.[161] His debut album, Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans, is predominantly a pop and R&amp;B record, influence by most of the genres mentioned above.[156][157][159] His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul, as well as balladry.[161][162] Lyrically, the album is different from the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality.[163][164] The explicit content in the song \"Gorilla\" caused a controversy in Australia.[165] Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans, reflect \"feel-good\", carefree, and optimistic sentiments.[166][167] However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour.[159][168] Mars' third album, 24K Magic, was significantly influenced by R&amp;B, funk and soul music.[158][169] Lyrically, the album involves themes of money and sex.[170] Mars has explained his writing process: \"I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', since \"You can\u2019t force creativeness\" as inspiration comes out of the blue in different places. Ideas occur suddenly to him; and occasionally, he is able to materialize them into lyrics.[102]\nMars claims that his work with other artists has influenced his musical style: \"Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's Just the Way You Are. If you know my story, you know I love all different genres of music.\"[171] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: \"In Hawaii some of the biggest radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first.\"[150]\nPhilip Lawrence, one of his music partners from The Smeezingtons, stated: \"What people don't know is there's a darker underbelly to Bruno Mars.\" Nevertheless, most of his music is romantic and Mars himself says: \"I blame that on me singing to girls back in high school\".[38]\nMars possesses a three octave tenor vocal range.[162] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that he is one of the most \"versatile and accessible singers in pop, with a light, soul-influenced voice that's an easy fit in a range of styles, a universal donor\",[160] while Tim Sendra from AllMusic described Mars' vocals on Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans as \"the kind of smooth instrument that slips into your ear like honey.\"[172] Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone called Mars a \"nimble, soulful vocalist\" on Unorthodox Jukebox. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Mars' voice due to \"the purity, cream and range of mid-period Michael Jackson\" in a review of a concert promoting Unorthodox Jukebox.[173] On 24K Magic, Consequence of Sound's Karen Gwen afirmed that Mars showed his \"pips\" and pushed his vocals to the limit. She described his voice as a \"clear, unapologetic tenor\" being a \"blessing\" nowadays.[174] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found 24K Magic to show Mars' vocal ability from tenderness to \"the more forceful side of his voice\".[175] Mars is also able to play drums,[176][177] guitar,[177][178] keyboard,[178] bass,[177] and piano.[80][178] Mars usually plays the instrumentation or part of it, on his albums and on the songs he composes for other artists.[177][179]\nMars is known for his retro showmanship which is widely acclaimed by tour critics and reviewers.[180][181][182] Deanna Ramsay of The Jakarta Post described Mars as a \"truly global star\".[183] Boston Herald's Jim Sullivan compared Mars' shownmaship to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley.[180] Kevin Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called Mars a \"consummate performer.\"[184] The Boston Globe's Sarah Rodman said that Mars shows an \"indefatigable ecstatic approach to performing\" and \"classic showmanship.\"[181] In the same vein, Jim Farber of the Daily News stated of the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVIII that Mars \"brings old-school showmanship to dynamic performance.\"[182] The singer took its inspiration by playing videotapes of Elvis, James Brown and Michael Jackson when he was younger. Nowadays, before the shows, he watches Brown's T.A.M.I. Show, James Hendrix's Live at Woodstock or Prince performing \"Purple Rain\" (1984).[4]\nDuring The Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans Tour, Ara Jansan from The West Australian called the performance \"one of the most creative and exciting displays of musical artistry\" she had witnessed in a long time and noticed the concert attracted a wide-ranging audience of all age groups.[185] The Oregonian's Robert Ham explained that the singer not only grabbed the spectators' attention throughout the entire concert, but he also sang every note by himself with noticeable guitar skills.[186] On the Moonshine Jungle Tour, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described Mars' performance as \"entertaining ... keeping smiles plastered on the faces of his onlookers, and he does a better job at it than almost anyone working in music right now\".[187] Rolling Stone magazine placed Mars at number 35 on its list of 50 Best Live Acts Right Now in 2013; \"Anyone from the age of 5 to 95 can walk out of a Bruno Mars concert feeling like the show was designed just for them. Mars walks the old-school walk and talks the sexy talk, but he also nails the hits, leads a super-energetic nine-piece soul band, and rips a mean drum solo\".[188] NFL executives Sarah Moll and Tracy Perlman stated that: \"If you go to his concerts, it's 11-year-old girls to 65-year-old women\u2014it's everyone\", after seeing The Moonshine Jungle tour several times during the summer of 2013.[99]\nMars' concerts feature The Hooligans, a band that includes: a guitarist, bassist, drummer, keyboardist, and a horn section. They also serve as dancers and background singers.[184][189] Critics noted the difference the backup band and the arrangements made to the sound of the live versions of the songs compared to those on the album.[185][190] Mars' shows feature all-band choreographed dancing arrangements, which include footwork that is inspired by James Brown and the splits.[188][191][192] His shows are heavily influenced by the disco era with a soul revue-inspired set.[184][182] In addition, long, mellow, and soft interludes that echo the smooth contemporary R&amp;B style which was popular during the 1990s are also part of the show.[184][189] His set list blends several genres of music such as: pop, doo-wop, funk, R&amp;B, soul and reggae.[184][181] His first two headlining concert tours included various covers.[187][190] Mars' shows usually feature pyrotechnics, strobe and laser lighting,[181][184] and he typically plays the drums and guitar.[181][184]\nIn 2011, Mars appears in two commercials for Bench as part of their clothing line \"Bench On Mars\" and \"Bruno Mars Gets Khaki in Bench\".[197]\nOn May 12, 2013, Mars tweeted a picture of himself using an electronic cigarette. On May 30, 2013, a press release was published reporting Mars' investment in the NJOY Electronic Cigarette Company, \"in order to quit smoking for his mother\", since the singer \"believes in the product and the company's mission.\"[198]\nIn 2014, Bruno Mars teamed up with three partners to launch the \"Selvarey Rum\" brand which includes Selvarey White, made of blended three and five-year aged Panamanian rums and the five-year-old rum flavored with chocolate, Selvarey Cacao.[199] In the same year, Mars decided to invest in Chromatik, which makes digital versions of sheet music for the web and iPad. Mars said: \"I love that Chromatik will bring better music education into schools\" ... \"[a]nd I'm happy to be a part of it.\"[200]\nOn February 26, 2014, it was announced that Mars had partnered with the Hawai'i Community Foundation and the GRAMMY Foundation to establish a GRAMMY Camp Scholarship Fund, in order to support the next generation of music makers with funds to provide financial assistance for qualified needs-based applicants from Hawaii.[201] On September 27, 2017, Mars expanded his camp scholarship in order to include applicants from all over the United States. The singer established the partnership in honor of his mother.[202]\nA day before a concert in the Philippines Mars donated $100,000 (US) to the orphans of Bantay Bata, who were among the victims of Typhoon Haiyan, in order to raise the morale of those who lost their families and homes.[203][204] Mars performed at the Make It Right gala, whose campaign goal is to \"help build homes for people in need.\"[205] He also performed at the Robin Hood Foundation's 2014 annual benefit in New York, whose goal is to \"fight poverty in New York City by supporting more than 200 nonprofits with financial and technical assistance.\"[206]\nIn 2017, Mars donated 1 million dollars from the show at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan to help the victims of the Flint water crisis.[207] The singer participated in the \"Somos Una Voz\" relief initiative, created by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, in order to help survivors of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Mexico's 7.1 earthquake.[208] In November 2018, Mars donated 24,000 meals in aid to the Salvation Army Hawaiian &amp; Pacific Islands Division's 48th annual Thanksgiving Dinner.[209]\nBruno Mars has earned numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including eleven Grammy Awards,[210] three Brit Awards,[211] four Guinness World Record[116][212][213] nine American and 10 Soul Train Music Awards.[214][215] In 2011, Mars made Time magazine's 100 list, while his former songwriting and record producing team, The Smeezingtons, earned several accolades.[216][217][218] At the 2018 Grammys, Mars became the second artist to win Record and Song of the Year with two different songs from the same album.[219] In 2019, Billboard placed him on number 41 of its list of Greatest of All Time Artists and was number 14 on the list of Top Touring Artists of the 2010s decade.[220][221] In the same year, iHeartRadio Canada placed Mars on theirs \"Icons of the Decade\" of the 2010s.[222]\nMars' \"When I Was Your Man\" became the second number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 to feature exclusively piano and vocals.[223] He is the first male artist to place two titles as a lead act in the Hot 100's top 10 simultaneously.[224] In total, he has had seven number-one singles on the Hot 100 chart.[35] In 2018, Mars matched Beyonce and Mariah Carey as the only artists with three Top Five singles on the Billboard Hot 100 from their first three studio albums.[225] In the same year, he became the first solo male artist with nine number ones on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart.[226] Mars, Ed Sheeran and Jewel are the only artists with two songs to spend at least half a year on the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10.[227]\nAccording to the International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI), \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Grenade\" are two of the most successful digital singles of all time, with sales of 12.5 million and 10.2 million, respectively. This contributed to Mars becoming the biggest selling artist of 2012.[228] His songs \"Just The Way You Are\", \"Grenade\", \"Locked Out Of Heaven\", and \"When I Was Your Man\" have each sold over 4 million digital copies, making him the first male artist to do so as a lead singer.[229] Six of his singles are counted among the best-selling singles of all time.[230] As of 2016[update] and 2018, the singer has sold 26 million albums and over 200 million singles worldwide, respectively.[148][231]\nDue to the ticket reselling which occurred during the week after Mars' performance at the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping.[232] The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.[233] However, the bill died at the conference committee.[234]\nMars's brother, Eric, has continuously served as the drummer for his backup band, The Hooligans. Their sisters, Tiara, Tahiti, and Presley, as well as their cousin Jaime, make up the all-girl music group The Lylas. When she was young, Jamie moved in with the siblings due to parental issues.[235] Mars began dating model Jessica Caban in 2011.[236] The two remain a couple as of 2019[update], residing together in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills with a Rottweiler named \"Geronimo\".[148]\nMars returned from an overseas gig in May 2013 when he learned in the Los Angeles airport that his mother was gravely ill. He immediately got on a plane to Hawaii. His mother died the next day.[148] On June 2, 2013, a publicist for Atlantic Records confirmed to the Associated Press that Mars' mother had suffered a brain aneurysm. She had died on Saturday, June 1, 2013, at age 55, at Queens Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii.[237][238] Later, on June 7, 2013, the singer wrote about the loss of his mother on Twitter: \"So thankful for all the love during the most difficult time in my life. I'll be back on my feet again soon. That's what mom wants, she told me.\"[239]\nIn 2013, Mars told Rolling Stone that record executives \"had trouble categorizing him\", as they were clueless which radio stations would play his songs, and which people (black or white) were going to buy his albums.[4] In the same month, he confessed that \"Nothin' on You\" was rejected by a \"music industry decision-maker\" because of his race. That experience made him feel like a \"mutant\", and he says that was his lowest point. \"Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room.\"[240] In 2018, Mars was accused during The Grapevine, a series which explores African-American issues, of cultural appropriation on social media for using his racial ambiguity to profit from black music, and was criticized for mimicking the sound of past artists. Various black celebrities, including Stevie Wonder, Charlie Wilson, 9th Wonder, Marjua Estevez, and Stereo Williams dismissed the accusations.[241][242][243] Mars has spoken often about his influences and has given credit to several black artists, such as Babyface, Teddy Riley, and Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis.[241][244]\nOn January 28, 2014, Demetrius Orlandus Proctor filed a lawsuit, claiming he holds the copyright for the Travie McCoy and Mars' track \"Billionaire\". Proctor claimed he owned the copyright to the music and lyrics of the track since March 31, 2011, though the song was released a year before. As evidence, Proctor has submitted a United States Copyright Office registration certificate for \"Frisky Vol. 1 to 30 (Tapes)\", issued in 2000. Proctor accused McCoy and Mars of \"willful and intentional\" infringe copyright, seeking the destruction of all copies of the recording. Proctor claims he has exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the song.[245]\nMark Ronson and Mars' \"Uptown Funk\" has received various accusations and lawsuits over copyright infringement. In 2015, similarities with \"Oops Up Side Your Head\" (1979) by The Gap Band led them, along with keyboardist Rudolph Taylor, and producer Lonnie Simmons to be added as co-writers of \"Uptown Funk\" and receive publishing royalties.[246] In the same year, Serbian artist Viktorija argued that \"Uptown Funk\" infringed on one of her tracks. She decided not to sue Mars and Ronson.[247] In 2016, electro-funk band Collage sued Ronson and Mars for copying their single, \"Young Girls\" (1983), while The Sequence, a rap group, claimed it infringed their single \"Funk You Up\" (1979) and sued a year later.[248][249] In 2017, Lastrada Entertainment filed a lawsuit due to similarities with \"More Bounce to the Ounce\" (1980) by Zapp. The company seeks damage, a jury trial and prevent Ronson from profiting with \"Uptown Funk\".[250] In 2018, the Collage and Zapp lawsuit were dropped, it was not revealed if there was any financial settlement.[251][252]\n\"Treasure\" was re-registered with new writing credits, which included Thibaut Berland and Christopher Khan, due to the similarities with Breakbot's \"Baby I'm Yours\".[253]\nBillboard estimated Mars' earnings around $18,839,681, making him the twelfth highest paid musician of 2013.[254] Forbes magazine began reporting on Bruno Mars' earnings in 2014, calculating that the $60\u00a0million earned between June 2013 to June 2014, for his music and tour, which made him thirteenth on the list of the Celebrity 100 list.[255] In June 2017, Mars ranked at sixth on the Forbes World's Highest Paid Celebrities, earning an estimated $39 million throughout June 2016 \u2013 June 2017.[256] In July 2018, Forbes announced that Mars was America's highest-paid musician of 2017, with an estimated total of $100 million. This, in turn, placed him at number 11 on the Celebrity 100 list as well as being his highest yearly earnings to date.[115] In 2019, he was placed at number 54 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, with estimated earnings of $51.5 million throughout June 1, 2018, and June 1, 2019.[257]\nStudio albums\n\n\n\n</body></html>"

His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his older brother, Shannon Leto, lived with their mother and their maternal grandparents, Ruby (Russell) and William Lee Metrejon.[6] His father remarried, and committed suicide when Jared was eight.[9] Leto moved frequently with his family from Louisiana to different cities around the country.[10] \"My mom's father was in the Air Force,\" Leto has explained, \"so moving around a lot was a normal way of life.\"[11] Leto has two younger half-brothers from his father's second marriage.[6] Constance joined the hippie movement and encouraged her sons to get involved in the arts.[8] Leto stated he \"was raised around a lot of artists, musicians, photographers, painters and people that were in theater,\" adding that \"Just having the art communal hippie experience as a child, there wasn't a clear line that was drawn. We celebrated creative experience and creative expression. We didn't try and curtail it and stunt any of that kind of growth.\"[12] Leto started playing music with his brother at an early age and his first musical instrument was a broken-down piano.[13] After dropping out briefly in the 10th grade, Leto decided to return and focus on his education at the private Emerson Preparatory School in Washington, D.C.[14] He was interested in large-scale visual art and enrolled at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.[10][15] After developing an interest in filmmaking, he transferred to the School of Visual Arts in New York City.[10] While he was a student there, he wrote and starred in his own short film, Crying Joy.[15] He also attended the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, a part of George Washington University.[16] In 1992, Leto moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in directing, intending to take acting roles on the side.[17] He found minor roles on television shows but his first break came in 1994, after he was cast opposite Claire Danes as Jordan Catalano, her love interest, in the short-lived but well-reviewed ABC teen drama My So-Called Life.[7] The show was praised for its portrayal of adolescence and gained a strong cult following, despite being canceled after only one season.[18] The same year, he made his television film debut starring alongside Alicia Silverstone in Cool and the Crazy, and landed his first film role in the 1995 drama How to Make an American Quilt. He later co-starred with Christina Ricci in The Last of the High Kings (1996) and got a supporting role in Switchback (1997).[15] In 1997, Leto starred in the biopic Prefontaine in which he played the role of Olympic hopeful Steve Prefontaine. For the preparation of the role, Leto immersed himself in the runner's life, training for six weeks and meeting with members of his family and friends.[19] He bore a striking resemblance to the real Prefontaine, also adopting the athlete's voice and upright running style.[20] His portrayal received positive reviews from critics and is often considered his breakthrough role.[21][22] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle noted how Leto played the athlete with raw vitality; \"With hypnotic blue eyes and dirty blond hair, Leto captures the rock-star style Prefontaine affected, and he looks natural in fiery performances on the track, as well as off, where Pre affected a brash, confrontational style.\"[23] After landing the lead role of a British aristocrat in the 1998 drama Basil, Leto starred in the horror Urban Legend. The film was poorly received by most movie critics, however, it was a financial success.[24][25] The same year, Terrence Malick cast Leto for a supporting role in the war film The Thin Red Line alongside Sean Penn and Adrien Brody.[26] It garnered mostly positive reviews and was a moderate success in the box office.[27] It received multiple awards and nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations; Leto shared a Satellite Award with the rest of the cast.[28][29] Leto formed the rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars in 1998 in Los Angeles, California with his brother Shannon. When the group first started, Jared Leto did not allow his position of Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.[30] Their debut album had been in the works for a couple of years, with Leto writing the majority of the songs.[31] Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to Immortal Records.[32] In 1999, Leto played a gay high school teacher who attracts the attentions of Robert Downey, Jr. in Black and White, and had a supporting role in the drama Girl, Interrupted, an adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. He then portrayed Angel Face in Fight Club (1999), a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[11] He began dating actress Cameron Diaz in 1999 and the couple became engaged in 2000.[33] Leto played Paul Allen, a rival of Patrick Bateman, in the psychological thriller American Psycho (2000). Though the film polarized audiences and critics, Leto's performance was well received.[15] The same year, he starred as heroin addict Harry Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream, an adaptation of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel of the same name, directed by Darren Aronofsky and co-starring Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans. To prepare for his role, Leto lived on the streets of New York City and refrained from having sex for two months prior to shooting.[34][35] He starved himself for months, losing 28 pounds to realistically play his heroin addict character.[36] After the shooting of the film, Leto moved to Portugal and lived in a monastery for several months to gain weight.[34][35] His performance received critical acclaim by film critics who notably praised the actor's emotional courage in portraying the character's physical and mental degradation. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone commented that Leto \"excels by going beyond Harry's gaunt look to capture his grieving heart. His scenes with Ellen Burstyn as Sara, Harry's widowed mother, achieve a rare poignancy as son and mother drown in delusions.\"[37] Leto next appeared in the independent film Highway. Set in 1994, Leto is caught with the wife of his employer, a Vegas thug, and flees to Seattle with his best friend Jake Gyllenhaal in the week preceding Kurt Cobain's suicide. Filming finished in early 2000, but the film was not released until March 2002 on home video formats, although originally scheduled for a theatrical release.[38] During this period Leto focused increasingly on his music career, working with producers Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue on his band's debut album 30 Seconds to Mars, which was released on August 27, 2002, in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. It reached number 107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers.[39] Upon its release, 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews; music critic Megan O'Toole felt that the band managed to \"carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm.\"[40] The album was a slow-burning success, and eventually sold two million copies worldwide.[41] Leto returned to acting in 2002 with the thriller Panic Room, which marked his second teaming with director David Fincher. He played the supporting role of Junior, a burglar who terrorizes Jodie Foster. The film was well received by critics and became a financial success, grossing nearly US$200 million worldwide.[42][43] In 2003, Leto and Cameron Diaz ended their four-year relationship.[33] Leto's next film was the 2004 biographical film Alexander, directed by Oliver Stone. He portrayed Hephaestion, the closest friend of Alexander the Great. The film failed in the United States; Stone attributed its poor reception to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, with worldwide revenue of US$167 million.[44][45] The following year, Leto starred together with Nicolas Cage in the political crime thriller Lord of War. He played Vitaly, the younger brother of illegal arms dealer Yuri Orlov. The film was officially endorsed by the human rights group Amnesty International for highlighting the arms trafficking by the international arms industry.[46] It was positively received by movie critics and was a moderate commercial success.[47] It took two years to record Thirty Seconds to Mars' second studio album A Beautiful Lie, with the band traveling to four different continents to accommodate Leto's acting career. A Beautiful Lie was released on August 30, 2005, in the United States. It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries, with a sales total of over four million.[3] The band heavily toured in support of the album and played at several major festivals, including Roskilde, Pinkpop, Rock am Ring, and Download.[48] In 2006, Leto appeared in the neo-noir crime drama Lonely Hearts, the true story of the notorious \"lonely hearts killers\" of the 1940s, Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck. Playing Fernandez, he co-starred with Salma Hayek who played the role Beck. The film received mixed reviews from critics; however, Leto's acting was widely praised; Heather Huntington from Reelz wrote that his \"layered performance as the nattily dressing dandy with no remorse is truly impressive.\"[49] The same year, Leto directed the music video for \"The Kill\", a song by Thirty Seconds to Mars. At a press release, he stated that an \"insanely obnoxious Danish albino\" named Bartholomew Cubbins directed the video.[50] He later explained his decision to direct with a pseudonym saying, \"I really wanted people to be able to enjoy and experience the video without having any more preconceived notions or distractions, and just to let it be what it was. It wasn't important for me to lay claim to it in that way.\"[51] Bartholomew Cubbins is a recurring character in the Dr. Seuss universe and one of Leto's favorite characters created by the writer.[52] \"The Kill\" was inspired by themes of isolation and insanity present in the Stanley Kubrick-directed psychological horror film The Shining (1980). Leto said, \"The idea of isolation, identity, and self discovery were all elements present in the song. I thought this light homage was a good starting point and it soon grew to include many more elements outside of Kubrick's original piece.\"[53] The short film received a largely positive response and numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award.[54] Leto next directed a short film for \"From Yesterday\". It was filmed in the Forbidden City and became the first ever American music video shot in the People's Republic of China in its entirety. Hundreds of costumed extras were employed for the shoot, inspired by the empires of ancient Chinese dynasties.[55] Leto drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's historical drama The Last Emperor (1987) as well as the work of Akira Kurosawa.[56] In 2007, Leto starred in the biographical film Chapter 27. He portrayed Mark David Chapman, a fanatic fan of The Beatles and the murderer of John Lennon. Leto prepared for his role by relying on interviews with Chapman and on audiotapes recorded by a librarian which the actor met during a visit to the inmate's hometown. Leto gained 67 pounds to approximate the killer's physique.[57] The abruptness of his weight gain gave him gout. He was forced to use a wheelchair due to the stress of the sudden increase in weight put on his body.[58] After the shooting of the film, he quickly went on a liquid diet.[59] Chapter 27 premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Leto's performance was widely praised.[60] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly considered his acting \"a genuine transformation, as the actor submerges himself in Chapman's couch-potato flab and red-rimmed eyes.\u00a0... Leto disappears inside this angry, mouth-breathing psycho geek with a conviction that had me hanging on his every delusion.\"[61] Leto's next short film was \"A Beautiful Lie\" (2008), which he directed under the pseudonym of Angakok Panipaq. The music video was filmed 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland. Determined to offset the impact that filming would have on the environment, Leto worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption on the shoot.[62] Upon release, \"A Beautiful Lie\" was met with widespread critical acclaim, resulting in various accolades, including the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video.[63] Proceeds from the video's sales benefited the Natural Resources Defense Council.[64] The same year, Leto remixed a version of the song \"The Only One\" by The Cure for their extended play Hypnagogic States.[65] In August 2008, during the recording process of their third studio album, Thirty Seconds to Mars attempted to sign with a new label, prompting EMI (the parent label of Virgin), to file a $30 million breach of contract lawsuit.[66] After nearly a year of legal battles, the band announced on April 28, 2009, that the suit had been settled following a defence based on the De Havilland Law.[67] Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI and released their third album This Is War in December 2009 to critical acclaim.[68][69] This Is War reached the top ten of several national album charts and earned numerous music awards.[70] Leto's next film was the 2009 science fiction drama Mr. Nobody, directed by Jaco Van Dormael. He portrayed the title role of Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. His role required him to play various versions of his character, from 34 to 118 years old, spending six hours daily for the full make-up and adopting the voice of an old-aged man.[71] Mr. Nobody premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival. Critical response praised the film's artistry and Leto's performance.[72] Boyd van Hoeij from Variety felt that \"his acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth. Despite too much old-age makeup, Leto nevertheless infuses the character with some real raw emotional power;\"[73] while Bruce Kirkland of Toronto Sun claimed that Leto gave \"a marvelously full-blooded, brain-spinning, tour-de-force performance.\"[74] In 2009, Leto recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers for the short film of \"Kings and Queens\", which features a critical mass movement founded with forward-thinking and eco-conscious intentions, through Los Angeles at night.[75] The short film premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles and was positively received.[76] At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Kings and Queens\" received four nominations, including Video of the Year and Best Direction, and went on to win Best Rock Video.[77] Thirty Seconds to Mars began their Into the Wild Tour in February 2010 and was among the hardest-working touring artists of the year.[78] Leto filmed \"Closer to the Edge\" (2010), a short film featuring tour footage, fan commentary and pictures of Thirty Seconds to Mars from their youth, during the band's Into the Wild Tour. Critics lauded the simplicity of the video; James Montgomery from MTV wrote, \"there's no denying the power of seeing tens of thousands of fans finding a simultaneous salvation, of a crowd of individuals becoming one. It's what rock and roll is supposed to be about, really: inclusion.\"[79] In December 2011, Thirty Seconds to Mars entered the Guinness World Records for most live shows during a single album cycle, with 300 shows.[69] Leto's next project was \"Hurricane\" (2010), an experimental short film which explores personal demons and unlocking secret fantasies in what is believed to be a dream.[80] Leto filmed it in New York City and described its concept as a \"surrealistic nightmare dream-fantasy.\"[81] Upon release, \"Hurricane\" garnered controversy and was initially censored due to its elements of violence.[82] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, the short film received three nominations in the categories of Best Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Editing.[83] In 2012, Leto made his directorial debut with the documentary film Artifact. It chronicles the modern music business as it charts the legal dispute between Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI, after the band tried to exit its contract over a royalties dispute.[66] Artifact was made on a limited budget provided by Leto and personal assistant Emma Ludbrook through the production company Sisyphus Corporation.[84] It premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival where it received the People's Choice Award for Best Documentary.[85] Critics praised the examination of the state of the modern music industry and its focus on the relationship between artists and record companies.[86] The film received a limited theatrical release beginning November 23, 2013, before being released digitally on December 3, 2013.[87] Thirty Seconds to Mars released their fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, in May 2013 through Universal. The album was produced by Leto with previous collaborator Steve Lillywhite. It received generally positive reviews and reached the top ten in more than fifteen countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States.[88] Leto filmed the 2013 short film for \"Up in the Air\" at a now-defunct aerospace manufacturing building in Los Angeles, California. He described it as a \"bizarre and hallucinogenic journey through an incredibly surreal landscape.\"[89] The short film features several artists, including burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese, gymnasts McKayla Maroney and Jordyn Wieber, writer Neil Strauss and a number of animals.[90] It garnered several awards, including the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video, and competed at the 2013 Camerimage.[91] Leto described the concept of his next short film, \"Do or Die\" (2013), as a companion piece to \"Closer to the Edge\" (2010).[92] It was filmed during the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and features live footage of Thirty Seconds to Mars onstage as well as fan commentary. The same year, Leto directed the critically praised short film for \"City of Angels\", which premiered on October 12, 2013 at the Hollywood Bowl. The music video features a number of celebrities who join the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles.[93] Multiple monoliths and murals, including Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators, also appear, as well as homeless people hired by Leto himself for the video.[94] After a five years hiatus from filming, Leto returned to act in the drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e and co-starring Matthew McConaughey. Leto portrayed Rayon, a drug-addicted transgender woman with AIDS who befriends McConaughey's character Ron Woodroof. In order to accurately portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body.[95] He stated the portrayal was grounded in his meeting transgender people while researching the role.[96] During filming, Leto refused to break character.[95] Dallas Buyers Club received widespread critical acclaim and became a financial success, resulting in various accolades for Leto, who was awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role and a variety of film critics' circle awards for the role.[97] In 2014, Leto premiered the documentary series Into the Wild, which tells the story behind the concert tour of the same name by Thirty Seconds to Mars that propelled the group into arenas around the world and was certified by the Guinness World Records as the longest running tour in the history of rock music.[98] The series was produced by Leto and Emma Ludbrook and was released through the online platform VyRT.[99] On November 3, 2015, it was announced that Thirty Seconds to Mars were working on their fifth studio album.[100] In December of that year, Warner Bros. confirmed that Leto would play the role of the Joker in Suicide Squad (2016), a supervillain film based on the comic book series of the same name.[101] The film opened to generally negative reviews from critics, but Leto's performance was praised despite his character's limited screen time.[102][103] In April 2016, it was announced that Leto would appear in the film The Outsider (2018), directed by Martin Zandvliet.[104][105][106] In August 2016, Thirty Seconds to Mars revealed they had signed to Interscope Records and confirmed that a new album will be released in 2017.[107] That same month Leto was cast as the villain Niander Wallace in the 2017 film Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to Blade Runner.[108] Leto later also appeared in 2036: Nexus Dawn, a promotional short film that takes place before Blade Runner 2049 directed by Luke Scott and co-starring Benedict Wong.[109] From May to September 2017, Thirty Seconds to Mars embarked on a North American tour with Muse and PVRIS.[110] In August 2017, \"Walk on Water\" was announced as the lead single from the band's fifth album.[111] Thirty Seconds to Mars then performed the song at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards featuring special guest Travis Scott. During the ceremony, Jared Leto received media attention for his tribute to musicians Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell, who both died earlier that year.[112] In February 2018, the band officially announced the Monolith Tour with Walk the Moon, Misterwives, K. Flay, Joywave, and Welshly Arms. Thirty Seconds to Mars later confirmed America as title of their fifth album, which was released on April 6, 2018.

Leto will serve as an executive producer in addition to reprising his role as the Joker, with the studio's intent that the film will \"pave the way\" for all other Suicide Squad-related projects.

After starting his career with television appearances in the early 1990s, Leto achieved recognition for his role as Jordan Catalano on the television series My So-Called Life (1994). He made his film debut in How to Make an American Quilt (1995) and received critical praise for his performance in Prefontaine (1997). Leto played supporting roles in The Thin Red Line (1998), Fight Club (1999) and American Psycho (2000), as well as the lead role in Urban Legend (1998), and earned critical acclaim after portraying heroin addict Harry Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream (2000). He later began focusing increasingly on his music career, returning to acting with Panic Room (2002), Alexander (2004), Lord of War (2005), Lonely Hearts (2006), Chapter 27 (2007), and Mr. Nobody (2009). In 2012, he directed the documentary film Artifact. He then appeared in Suicide Squad (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017).\nLeto's performance as a transgender woman in Dallas Buyers Club (2013) earned him an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor. Leto is considered to be a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. He often remains completely in character for the duration of the shooting schedules of his films, even to the point of adversely affecting his health.[1] He is also known to be selective about his film roles.[2]\nLeto is the lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and main songwriter for Thirty Seconds to Mars, a band he formed in 1998 in Los Angeles, California, with his older brother Shannon Leto. Their debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was released to positive reviews, but only to limited commercial success.[3] The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005). Their following releases, This Is War (2009), and Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), received further critical and commercial success.[4] As of September\u00a02014[update], the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.[5] Leto has also directed music videos, including the MTV Video Music Award\u2013winning \"The Kill\" (2006), \"Kings and Queens\" (2009), and \"Up in the Air\" (2013).\nJared Joseph Leto was born on December 26, 1971, in Bossier City, Louisiana, to Constance Leto (n\u00e9e Metrejon).[6][7] His mother has Cajun ancestry.[8] \"Leto\" is the surname of his stepfather. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his older brother, Shannon Leto, lived with their mother and their maternal grandparents, Ruby (Russell) and William Lee Metrejon.[6] His father remarried, and committed suicide when Jared was eight.[9] Leto moved frequently with his family from Louisiana to different cities around the country.[10] \"My mom's father was in the Air Force,\" Leto has explained, \"so moving around a lot was a normal way of life.\"[11] Leto has two younger half-brothers from his father's second marriage.[6]\nConstance joined the hippie movement and encouraged her sons to get involved in the arts.[8] Leto stated he \"was raised around a lot of artists, musicians, photographers, painters and people that were in theater,\" adding that \"Just having the art communal hippie experience as a child, there wasn't a clear line that was drawn. We celebrated creative experience and creative expression. We didn't try and curtail it and stunt any of that kind of growth.\"[12] Leto started playing music with his brother at an early age and his first musical instrument was a broken-down piano.[13]\nAfter dropping out briefly in the 10th grade, Leto decided to return and focus on his education at the private Emerson Preparatory School in Washington, D.C.[14] He was interested in large-scale visual art and enrolled at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.[10][15] After developing an interest in filmmaking, he transferred to the School of Visual Arts in New York City.[10] While he was a student there, he wrote and starred in his own short film, Crying Joy.[15] He also attended the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, a part of George Washington University.[16]\nIn 1992, Leto moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in directing, intending to take acting roles on the side.[17] He found minor roles on television shows but his first break came in 1994, after he was cast opposite Claire Danes as Jordan Catalano, her love interest, in the short-lived but well-reviewed ABC teen drama My So-Called Life.[7] The show was praised for its portrayal of adolescence and gained a strong cult following, despite being canceled after only one season.[18] The same year, he made his television film debut starring alongside Alicia Silverstone in Cool and the Crazy, and landed his first film role in the 1995 drama How to Make an American Quilt. He later co-starred with Christina Ricci in The Last of the High Kings (1996) and got a supporting role in Switchback (1997).[15]\nIn 1997, Leto starred in the biopic Prefontaine in which he played the role of Olympic hopeful Steve Prefontaine. For the preparation of the role, Leto immersed himself in the runner's life, training for six weeks and meeting with members of his family and friends.[19] He bore a striking resemblance to the real Prefontaine, also adopting the athlete's voice and upright running style.[20] His portrayal received positive reviews from critics and is often considered his breakthrough role.[21][22] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle noted how Leto played the athlete with raw vitality; \"With hypnotic blue eyes and dirty blond hair, Leto captures the rock-star style Prefontaine affected, and he looks natural in fiery performances on the track, as well as off, where Pre affected a brash, confrontational style.\"[23]\nAfter landing the lead role of a British aristocrat in the 1998 drama Basil, Leto starred in the horror Urban Legend. The film was poorly received by most movie critics, however, it was a financial success.[24][25] The same year, Terrence Malick cast Leto for a supporting role in the war film The Thin Red Line alongside Sean Penn and Adrien Brody.[26] It garnered mostly positive reviews and was a moderate success in the box office.[27] It received multiple awards and nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations; Leto shared a Satellite Award with the rest of the cast.[28][29]\nLeto formed the rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars in 1998 in Los Angeles, California with his brother Shannon. When the group first started, Jared Leto did not allow his position of Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.[30] Their debut album had been in the works for a couple of years, with Leto writing the majority of the songs.[31] Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to Immortal Records.[32]\nIn 1999, Leto played a gay high school teacher who attracts the attentions of Robert Downey, Jr. in Black and White, and had a supporting role in the drama Girl, Interrupted, an adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. He then portrayed Angel Face in Fight Club (1999), a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[11] He began dating actress Cameron Diaz in 1999 and the couple became engaged in 2000.[33]\nLeto played Paul Allen, a rival of Patrick Bateman, in the psychological thriller American Psycho (2000). Though the film polarized audiences and critics, Leto's performance was well received.[15] The same year, he starred as heroin addict Harry Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream, an adaptation of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel of the same name, directed by Darren Aronofsky and co-starring Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans. To prepare for his role, Leto lived on the streets of New York City and refrained from having sex for two months prior to shooting.[34][35] He starved himself for months, losing 28 pounds to realistically play his heroin addict character.[36] After the shooting of the film, Leto moved to Portugal and lived in a monastery for several months to gain weight.[34][35] His performance received critical acclaim by film critics who notably praised the actor's emotional courage in portraying the character's physical and mental degradation. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone commented that Leto \"excels by going beyond Harry's gaunt look to capture his grieving heart. His scenes with Ellen Burstyn as Sara, Harry's widowed mother, achieve a rare poignancy as son and mother drown in delusions.\"[37]\nLeto next appeared in the independent film Highway. Set in 1994, Leto is caught with the wife of his employer, a Vegas thug, and flees to Seattle with his best friend Jake Gyllenhaal in the week preceding Kurt Cobain's suicide. Filming finished in early 2000, but the film was not released until March 2002 on home video formats, although originally scheduled for a theatrical release.[38]\nDuring this period Leto focused increasingly on his music career, working with producers Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue on his band's debut album 30 Seconds to Mars, which was released on August 27, 2002, in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. It reached number 107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers.[39] Upon its release, 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews; music critic Megan O'Toole felt that the band managed to \"carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm.\"[40] The album was a slow-burning success, and eventually sold two million copies worldwide.[41]\nLeto returned to acting in 2002 with the thriller Panic Room, which marked his second teaming with director David Fincher. He played the supporting role of Junior, a burglar who terrorizes Jodie Foster. The film was well received by critics and became a financial success, grossing nearly US$200 million worldwide.[42][43] In 2003, Leto and Cameron Diaz ended their four-year relationship.[33] Leto's next film was the 2004 biographical film Alexander, directed by Oliver Stone. He portrayed Hephaestion, the closest friend of Alexander the Great. The film failed in the United States; Stone attributed its poor reception to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, with worldwide revenue of US$167 million.[44][45]\nThe following year, Leto starred together with Nicolas Cage in the political crime thriller Lord of War. He played Vitaly, the younger brother of illegal arms dealer Yuri Orlov. The film was officially endorsed by the human rights group Amnesty International for highlighting the arms trafficking by the international arms industry.[46] It was positively received by movie critics and was a moderate commercial success.[47]\nIt took two years to record Thirty Seconds to Mars' second studio album A Beautiful Lie, with the band traveling to four different continents to accommodate Leto's acting career. A Beautiful Lie was released on August 30, 2005, in the United States. It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries, with a sales total of over four million.[3] The band heavily toured in support of the album and played at several major festivals, including Roskilde, Pinkpop, Rock am Ring, and Download.[48]\nIn 2006, Leto appeared in the neo-noir crime drama Lonely Hearts, the true story of the notorious \"lonely hearts killers\" of the 1940s, Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck. Playing Fernandez, he co-starred with Salma Hayek who played the role Beck. The film received mixed reviews from critics; however, Leto's acting was widely praised; Heather Huntington from Reelz wrote that his \"layered performance as the nattily dressing dandy with no remorse is truly impressive.\"[49]\nThe same year, Leto directed the music video for \"The Kill\", a song by Thirty Seconds to Mars. At a press release, he stated that an \"insanely obnoxious Danish albino\" named Bartholomew Cubbins directed the video.[50] He later explained his decision to direct with a pseudonym saying, \"I really wanted people to be able to enjoy and experience the video without having any more preconceived notions or distractions, and just to let it be what it was. It wasn't important for me to lay claim to it in that way.\"[51] Bartholomew Cubbins is a recurring character in the Dr. Seuss universe and one of Leto's favorite characters created by the writer.[52] \"The Kill\" was inspired by themes of isolation and insanity present in the Stanley Kubrick-directed psychological horror film The Shining (1980). Leto said, \"The idea of isolation, identity, and self discovery were all elements present in the song. I thought this light homage was a good starting point and it soon grew to include many more elements outside of Kubrick's original piece.\"[53] The short film received a largely positive response and numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award.[54] Leto next directed a short film for \"From Yesterday\". It was filmed in the Forbidden City and became the first ever American music video shot in the People's Republic of China in its entirety. Hundreds of costumed extras were employed for the shoot, inspired by the empires of ancient Chinese dynasties.[55] Leto drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's historical drama The Last Emperor (1987) as well as the work of Akira Kurosawa.[56]\nIn 2007, Leto starred in the biographical film Chapter 27. He portrayed Mark David Chapman, a fanatic fan of The Beatles and the murderer of John Lennon. Leto prepared for his role by relying on interviews with Chapman and on audiotapes recorded by a librarian which the actor met during a visit to the inmate's hometown. Leto gained 67 pounds to approximate the killer's physique.[57] The abruptness of his weight gain gave him gout. He was forced to use a wheelchair due to the stress of the sudden increase in weight put on his body.[58] After the shooting of the film, he quickly went on a liquid diet.[59] Chapter 27 premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Leto's performance was widely praised.[60] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly considered his acting \"a genuine transformation, as the actor submerges himself in Chapman's couch-potato flab and red-rimmed eyes.\u00a0... Leto disappears inside this angry, mouth-breathing psycho geek with a conviction that had me hanging on his every delusion.\"[61]\nLeto's next short film was \"A Beautiful Lie\" (2008), which he directed under the pseudonym of Angakok Panipaq. The music video was filmed 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland. Determined to offset the impact that filming would have on the environment, Leto worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption on the shoot.[62] Upon release, \"A Beautiful Lie\" was met with widespread critical acclaim, resulting in various accolades, including the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video.[63] Proceeds from the video's sales benefited the Natural Resources Defense Council.[64] The same year, Leto remixed a version of the song \"The Only One\" by The Cure for their extended play Hypnagogic States.[65]\nIn August 2008, during the recording process of their third studio album, Thirty Seconds to Mars attempted to sign with a new label, prompting EMI (the parent label of Virgin), to file a $30 million breach of contract lawsuit.[66] After nearly a year of legal battles, the band announced on April 28, 2009, that the suit had been settled following a defence based on the De Havilland Law.[67] Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI and released their third album This Is War in December 2009 to critical acclaim.[68][69] This Is War reached the top ten of several national album charts and earned numerous music awards.[70]\nLeto's next film was the 2009 science fiction drama Mr. Nobody, directed by Jaco Van Dormael. He portrayed the title role of Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. His role required him to play various versions of his character, from 34 to 118 years old, spending six hours daily for the full make-up and adopting the voice of an old-aged man.[71] Mr. Nobody premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival. Critical response praised the film's artistry and Leto's performance.[72] Boyd van Hoeij from Variety felt that \"his acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth. Despite too much old-age makeup, Leto nevertheless infuses the character with some real raw emotional power;\"[73] while Bruce Kirkland of Toronto Sun claimed that Leto gave \"a marvelously full-blooded, brain-spinning, tour-de-force performance.\"[74]\nIn 2009, Leto recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers for the short film of \"Kings and Queens\", which features a critical mass movement founded with forward-thinking and eco-conscious intentions, through Los Angeles at night.[75] The short film premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles and was positively received.[76] At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Kings and Queens\" received four nominations, including Video of the Year and Best Direction, and went on to win Best Rock Video.[77] Thirty Seconds to Mars began their Into the Wild Tour in February 2010 and was among the hardest-working touring artists of the year.[78]\nLeto filmed \"Closer to the Edge\" (2010), a short film featuring tour footage, fan commentary and pictures of Thirty Seconds to Mars from their youth, during the band's Into the Wild Tour. Critics lauded the simplicity of the video; James Montgomery from MTV wrote, \"there's no denying the power of seeing tens of thousands of fans finding a simultaneous salvation, of a crowd of individuals becoming one. It's what rock and roll is supposed to be about, really: inclusion.\"[79] In December 2011, Thirty Seconds to Mars entered the Guinness World Records for most live shows during a single album cycle, with 300 shows.[69]\nLeto's next project was \"Hurricane\" (2010), an experimental short film which explores personal demons and unlocking secret fantasies in what is believed to be a dream.[80] Leto filmed it in New York City and described its concept as a \"surrealistic nightmare dream-fantasy.\"[81] Upon release, \"Hurricane\" garnered controversy and was initially censored due to its elements of violence.[82] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, the short film received three nominations in the categories of Best Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Editing.[83]\nIn 2012, Leto made his directorial debut with the documentary film Artifact. It chronicles the modern music business as it charts the legal dispute between Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI, after the band tried to exit its contract over a royalties dispute.[66] Artifact was made on a limited budget provided by Leto and personal assistant Emma Ludbrook through the production company Sisyphus Corporation.[84] It premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival where it received the People's Choice Award for Best Documentary.[85] Critics praised the examination of the state of the modern music industry and its focus on the relationship between artists and record companies.[86] The film received a limited theatrical release beginning November 23, 2013, before being released digitally on December 3, 2013.[87]\nThirty Seconds to Mars released their fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, in May 2013 through Universal. The album was produced by Leto with previous collaborator Steve Lillywhite. It received generally positive reviews and reached the top ten in more than fifteen countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States.[88] Leto filmed the 2013 short film for \"Up in the Air\" at a now-defunct aerospace manufacturing building in Los Angeles, California. He described it as a \"bizarre and hallucinogenic journey through an incredibly surreal landscape.\"[89] The short film features several artists, including burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese, gymnasts McKayla Maroney and Jordyn Wieber, writer Neil Strauss and a number of animals.[90] It garnered several awards, including the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video, and competed at the 2013 Camerimage.[91]\nLeto described the concept of his next short film, \"Do or Die\" (2013), as a companion piece to \"Closer to the Edge\" (2010).[92] It was filmed during the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and features live footage of Thirty Seconds to Mars onstage as well as fan commentary. The same year, Leto directed the critically praised short film for \"City of Angels\", which premiered on October 12, 2013 at the Hollywood Bowl. The music video features a number of celebrities who join the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles.[93] Multiple monoliths and murals, including Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators, also appear, as well as homeless people hired by Leto himself for the video.[94]\nAfter a five years hiatus from filming, Leto returned to act in the drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e and co-starring Matthew McConaughey. Leto portrayed Rayon, a drug-addicted transgender woman with AIDS who befriends McConaughey's character Ron Woodroof. In order to accurately portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body.[95] He stated the portrayal was grounded in his meeting transgender people while researching the role.[96] During filming, Leto refused to break character.[95] Dallas Buyers Club received widespread critical acclaim and became a financial success, resulting in various accolades for Leto, who was awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role and a variety of film critics' circle awards for the role.[97]\nIn 2014, Leto premiered the documentary series Into the Wild, which tells the story behind the concert tour of the same name by Thirty Seconds to Mars that propelled the group into arenas around the world and was certified by the Guinness World Records as the longest running tour in the history of rock music.[98] The series was produced by Leto and Emma Ludbrook and was released through the online platform VyRT.[99] On November 3, 2015, it was announced that Thirty Seconds to Mars were working on their fifth studio album.[100]\nIn December of that year, Warner Bros. confirmed that Leto would play the role of the Joker in Suicide Squad (2016), a supervillain film based on the comic book series of the same name.[101] The film opened to generally negative reviews from critics, but Leto's performance was praised despite his character's limited screen time.[102][103] In April 2016, it was announced that Leto would appear in the film The Outsider (2018), directed by Martin Zandvliet.[104][105][106]\nIn August 2016, Thirty Seconds to Mars revealed they had signed to Interscope Records and confirmed that a new album will be released in 2017.[107] That same month Leto was cast as the villain Niander Wallace in the 2017 film Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to Blade Runner.[108] Leto later also appeared in 2036: Nexus Dawn, a promotional short film that takes place before Blade Runner 2049 directed by Luke Scott and co-starring Benedict Wong.[109]\nFrom May to September 2017, Thirty Seconds to Mars embarked on a North American tour with Muse and PVRIS.[110] In August 2017, \"Walk on Water\" was announced as the lead single from the band's fifth album.[111] Thirty Seconds to Mars then performed the song at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards featuring special guest Travis Scott. During the ceremony, Jared Leto received media attention for his tribute to musicians Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell, who both died earlier that year.[112] In February 2018, the band officially announced the Monolith Tour with Walk the Moon, Misterwives, K.

                "text": "no title\n\nKristen Anne Bell (born July 18, 1980)[1] is an American actress and singer. She began her professional acting career by starring in stage productions while attending the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. In 2001, she made her Broadway debut as Becky Thatcher in the comedy musical The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and starred in the Broadway revival of The Crucible the following year. In 2004, she appeared in the action thriller film Spartan and received critical praise for her performance in the television drama film Gracie's Choice. Bell garnered critical acclaim for her first major role as the title character in the teen noir drama television series Veronica Mars (2004\u20132007). For her performance, she was awarded a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. She reprised the eponymous role in the 2014 film continuation and the 2019 revival series. During her time on Veronica Mars, Bell starred as Mary Lane in the musical film Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005), a reprise of the role she had played in the New York musical upon which the film was based. From 2007 to 2008, Bell starred as Elle Bishop in the science fiction drama series Heroes. From 2007 to 2012, she voiced the titular narrator in the teen drama series Gossip Girl. In 2008, she had her breakout film role as the title character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She has since appeared in a number of comedy films, including Couples Retreat (2009), When in Rome (2010), You Again (2010), The Boss (2016), Bad Moms (2016), and A Bad Moms Christmas (2017). Bell garnered further recognition for voicing Princess Anna in the Disney animated fantasy films Frozen (2013), Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018), and Frozen II (2019), and the short films Frozen Fever (2015) and Olaf's Frozen Adventure (2017). From 2012 to 2016, Bell starred as Jeannie van der Hooven, the female lead on the Showtime comedy series House of Lies. From 2016 to 2020, she starred in the lead role of Eleanor Shellstrop on the acclaimed NBC comedy series The Good Place, for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy. Bell was born on July 18, 1980, in Huntington Woods, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, where she was raised. Her mother, Lorelei (n\u00e9e Frygier), is a registered nurse, and her father, Tom Bell, works as a television news director in Las Vegas, Nevada.[1][2] Her parents divorced when she was two years old, and she has two stepsisters from her father's second marriage. She also has two half-sisters and two half-brothers from her mother's second marriage.[citation needed] Her mother is of Polish descent, and her father has German, Scottish and Irish ancestry.[3] Bell stated that she did not like her first name at the age of four. Bell's mother convinced her to go by her middle name, Anne, instead; she used the name Annie until high school.[4] Bell once broke both her wrists at the same time playing street hockey with friends.[5] Just before her freshman year of high school, Bell's parents decided to remove her from the public school system.[6] She attended Shrine Catholic High School in nearby Royal Oak, where she took part in the drama and music club.[7] During her time at the school, she won the starring role in the school's 1997 production of The Wizard of Oz, as Dorothy Gale, and also appeared in productions of Fiddler on the Roof (1995), Lady, Be Good (1996), and Li'l Abner (1998). In 1998, the year she graduated, Bell was named the yearbook's \"Best Looking Girl\" by senior class vote.[8] Shortly after her high school graduation, Bell moved to New York City to attend New York University's Tisch School of the Arts,[4] majoring in musical theater.[9] In 2001, during her senior year, Bell left a few credits shy of graduating[10] to take a role in the Broadway musical version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. In 1992, Bell went to her first audition and won a dual role as a banana and a tree[11] in a suburban Detroit theater's production of Raggedy Ann and Andy.[4] Her mother had established her with an agent before Bell was 13, which allowed her to appear in newspaper advertisements for several Detroit retailers and television commercials. She also began private acting lessons.[4] In 1998, she appeared with an uncredited role in the locally filmed movie Polish Wedding. In 2001, Bell left New York University to play a role as Becky Thatcher in the short-lived Broadway musical of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. That same year, she made her credited film debut in Pootie Tang. Her one line in the film was cut, and her appearance exists only as a scene shown during the credit sequence.[12] Additionally, she auditioned for the television series Smallville for the role of Chloe Sullivan, which was eventually won by Allison Mack.[13] In 2002, she appeared in the Broadway revival of The Crucible with Liam Neeson, Angela Bettis and Laura Linney. Bell then moved to Los Angeles in 2002 because of her friendship with writers Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney,[12] and appeared in a handful of television shows as a special guest, finding trouble gaining a recurring role in a television series. Bell said she \"tested like eight times and booked nothing and every show [she] tested for got picked up\", including auditions for Skin and a Norm Macdonald series.[11] In 2004, Bell appeared in the Lifetime television film Gracie's Choice, which received one of the network's highest ratings.[10] She made her debut in a theatrically released film with David Mamet's Spartan, as Laura Newton, the kidnapped daughter of the U.S. President, acting alongside Val Kilmer. Bell also guest-starred on the HBO drama Deadwood in a two-episode story arc (\"Bullock Returns to the Camp\" and \"Suffer the Little Children\"). At 24, she won the role of the title character in UPN's drama Veronica Mars, which was launched in the fall of 2004. Created by Rob Thomas, the series starred Bell as the seventeen-year-old anti-establishment high school student/detective. Bell drew on the parallels between the character of Veronica and her own life, since Bell's parents had divorced and her best friend had also died.[10] The series earned acclaim from television critics, as did Bell's performance. Some critics asserted that her performance was overlooked, and deserved consideration for an Emmy Award.[14][15][16] Aside from working on Veronica Mars, Bell starred in Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical, reprising the role she played in the short-lived 2001 Off-Broadway musical. The musical was a spoof of the 1936 exploitation film of the same name. Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical debuted on the Showtime network on April 16, 2005. Also in April, Bell starred as Gracie in Fifty Pills, an entry for the Tribeca Film Festival. She appeared in a short independent film called The Receipt and the horror film Roman, which was directed by her Crucible co-star Angela Bettis. Released on August 11, 2006, Pulse starred Bell as the lead Mattie. A remake of the Japanese horror film Kairo, the film grossed US$27.9 million worldwide[17] but garnered negative response from critics. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter commented, \"despite the starring presence of Kristen Bell, [the] young actress has far less interesting material to work with here than she does as [the character] 'Veronica Mars.'\"[18] Veronica Mars continued on UPN for a second season; for the third season, the show was renewed and appeared on the newly created The CW. On January 19, 2007, CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff announced that while she was pleased with the gradual improvement of Veronica Mars's ratings, the series would be put on hiatus after February sweeps to air a new reality series, Pussycat Dolls Present. On May 17, 2007, Ostroff announced the cancellation of the series.[19] A two-hour series finale aired in the United States on May 22, 2007, and on June 11, 2007, Thomas officially announced in an email to TV Guide's Michael Ausiello that Veronica Mars had been canceled by the CW.[20] A Veronica Mars feature film and comic book series continuation had been discussed,[21] and for a short time there was talk of another collaboration between Bell and creator Thomas that would be unrelated to the Veronica Mars series.[19] Following the cancellation of Veronica Mars, Bell voiced interest in appearing on Heroes because she was a fan.[22] On July 29, 2007, during a train ride back to Los Angeles from the San Diego Comic-Con with Heroes actors Zachary Quinto and Masi Oka, and writers from the series, the writers had mentioned that if she \"ever want[ed] to come on Heroes, give us [writers] a call,\" to which Bell said she would \"love to.\"[23] Meanwhile, there were discussions about a role on Lost, but Bell turned down the role[24][25] of Charlotte Staples Lewis.[26] Bell portrayed Elle Bishop on Heroes, a \"mysterious young lady\" with an \"awesome power\".[23] She did not have to audition for the role of Elle,[12] who made her first appearance in an October 2007 episode, and appeared in twelve episodes during the run of the series.[27] The casting of Bell, Heroes creator Tim Kring explained, \"was not easy to pull off\", but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, \"we found a way to jump into a small window in [Bell's] schedule.\"[27] Bell lent her voice to the CW series Gossip Girl: she voiced the title character in every episode of the series, appearing in person only for a surprise cameo in the final episode, portraying herself. Shortly after the cancellation of Veronica Mars in early 2007, Bell filmed on location in Hawaii for a starring role as the title character in the Judd Apatow comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She regarded the improvisational comedy in the film as \"a lovely experience\".[12] The film, written by and also starring Jason Segel, was released theatrically on April 18, 2008, and greatly increased Bell's profile. Bell lent her voice and likeness to the video game Assassin's Creed, which was released on November 13, 2007, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and April 8, 2008, for the PC.[28] Bell reprised her role of Lucy in Assassin's Creed II released on November 17, 2009, and again in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, released on November 16, 2010.[29] In the spring of 2006, she finished filming the Star Wars-themed comedy Fanboys. Director Kyle Newman received additional funding to shoot new scenes, but the busy schedules of the actors only allowed for filming in September 2007. As a result, the release was delayed until January 14, 2008.[30] Bell also starred in the 2009 comedies Serious Moonlight, alongside Meg Ryan, and Couples Retreat, which chronicles four couples who partake in therapy sessions at a tropical island resort. Jason Bateman played her husband.[31] She also provided the voice for Cora in Astro Boy. On March 31, 2008, Bell began shooting the Mark Steven Johnson-written Disney film When in Rome on location in Rome and New York; the film was released in 2010.[32] Bell reprised her role as Sarah Marshall for a cameo appearance in the film Get Him to the Greek, a spin-off sequel from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, released June 4, 2010. She co-starred with singers Christina Aguilera and Cher in the musical film Burlesque, which was released on Thanksgiving in 2010. Bell had a cameo in the slasher horror film Scream 4, which was released on April 15, 2011.[33] In 2012, Bell starred in the family drama film Big Miracle.

Bell portrayed Mary Magdalene in The Truth & Life Dramatized Audio New Testament Bible, a 22-hour, celebrity-voiced, dramatized audio adaptation of the New Testament that uses the RSV-CE translation. Bell starred as Jeannie van der Hooven, the female lead on the Showtime comedy series House of Lies, which premiered on January 8, 2012. The series ended on June 12, 2016. Bell appeared in a supporting role in the science-fiction comedy Safety Not Guaranteed (2012). She starred in the drama film The Lifeguard, written and directed by Liz W. Garcia, which began filming in July 2012 and was released in August 2013.[34] She also voiced Anna in Frozen, which was released on November 22, 2013. In 2013, for multiple episodes, Bell played Ingrid de Forest, an Eagleton City Councilwoman, on Parks and Recreation. On March 13, 2013, it was confirmed that a Veronica Mars film would finally be coming to fruition. Bell and series creator Rob Thomas launched a fundraising campaign to produce the film through Kickstarter and attained the $2 million goal in less than ten hours.[35] The main cast members of the series all reprised their roles in the feature film. Production of the film took place during summer 2013, and it was released theatrically and on video-on-demand on March 14, 2014.[36][37] In September 2014, Bell starred with her husband, Dax Shepard, in a commercial for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S.[38] It was so popular (with over 20 million YouTube views) that they did another for the holiday season.[39] The ad agency McKinney was behind both.[40] In 2016, Bell voiced the sloth Priscilla in the animated comedy film Zootopia, and starred as Claire in the comedy film The Boss. Bell starred as Kiki in the 2016 comedy film Bad Moms, a role she reprised in the 2017 sequel, A Bad Moms Christmas.[41] In 2016, Bell began starring as Eleanor Shellstrop in the NBC comedy series The Good Place.[42] Also in 2017, she appeared in the biographical comedy-drama The Disaster Artist, the action comedy CHiPs and the comedy How to Be a Latin Lover. In November 2017, she played a housewife (with Dax Shepard as her husband) preparing for a Christmas party in Sia's music video for \"Santa's Coming For Us\".[43] In 2018, she began hosting the web series Momsplaining with Kristen Bell, with episodes airing on the Ellen DeGeneres video platform Ellentube. In the series, Bell gives new and expecting mothers tips about motherhood. The title of the series is a pun on the commonly used term \"mansplaining\".[44][45][46] Bell later had the leading role in the Netflix comedy-drama film Like Father. She also voiced the character of Jade Wilson in the animated comedy film Teen Titans Go! To the Movies and reprised her voice role as Princess Anna in the animated comedy sequel film Ralph Breaks the Internet.[47] On September 20, 2018, Hulu confirmed that Bell would reprise her role of Veronica Mars in an 8-episode fourth season of the drama series Veronica Mars. The series debuted in July 2019.[48] In 2019, she again reprised her role of Princess Anna in the video game, Kingdom Hearts III[49] and the sequel, Frozen II[50] which was released on November 22, 2019.[51] Bell served as host and executive producer on the Disney+ docuseries Encore!, which premiered in November 2019.[52] She made her directorial debut with the eighth episode of the fourth season of The Good Place.[53] The series concluded after its fourth season, airing its final episode in January 2020.[54] Bell is set to voice a main character in the Apple TV+ animated musical comedy series Central Park, which reunites her with Frozen co-star Josh Gad.[55] She will also voice a character in the animated musical series Do, Re, & Mi.[56] It was announced that Bell will star alongside Leslie Jones as pair of housewives who create a $40 million coupon scam in the comedy film Queenpins.[57] In 2006 and again in 2013,[58] Bell was selected \"World's Sexiest Vegetarian\" on PETA's yearly poll.[59] She was placed No. 68 on Maxim's 2005 \"Hot 100\" list,[60] No. 11 in Maxim's 2006 \"Hot 100\" list,[61] and No. 46 in Maxim's 2007 \"Hot 100\" list in which she was stated to have \"single-handedly saved The CW from becoming the worst network ever.\"[62] In 2006, Maxim also placed Bell at the top of the \"Fall TV's Criminally Sexy Investigators\" List.[59] In 2008, she was featured at No. 59 on AskMen's Top 99 Women of 2008 List.[63] Reflecting on her admitted popularity with \"geeks\", Bell was voted the fourth-sexiest woman on TV by the staff at Wizard magazine.[64] Bell stated she never thought of herself as womanly because \"I always play and look and act 10 years younger than I am.\" However, she said, \"Something magical happened when I turned 25\u2014I looked in the mirror and was like, 'You might not get carded for an R-rated movie anymore.' Like I didn't have a little stick figure anymore.\"[65] Bell has said that many of her characters are tomboys because she was \"not homely enough to play the nerdy girl and not nearly pretty enough to play the pretty girl\".[65] Bell has been associated with the idea that \"nerdy is the new cool\", and she explained, \"what was previously perceived as nerdy is now viewed as original. What I like about nerdiness, geekiness, is it doesn't really matter what you're into\u2014it just means you're not a follower.\"[65] She has also said, \"I love nerds. Comic-Con junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow. Isn't that funny? The tables have turned.\"[12] Vanessa Juarez of Entertainment Weekly commented that Bell's roles on Veronica Mars, Heroes and as a Star Wars fanatic in Fanboys have \"solidif[ied] her placement at the center of the geek universe,\" while Rodney Rothman stated, \"I guess she's cornered the market on losers.\"[66] Bell's work is often compared to Sarah Michelle Gellar's portrayal of the title character on the cult television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[67] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter stated that Bell was \"arguably the television successor [to Gellar's portrayal of Buffy] when it comes to fighting bad guys.\" Bell is sometimes confused with Lauren Conrad from The Hills. \"Yeah, sometimes fans yell, 'Hey, Lauren' to me, but usually from a distance,\" said Bell.[18] Despite \"new celebrity\" status, Bell claimed that she was not concerned because \"no one ever recognizes me anyway\". She has said that her friend Hayden Panettiere is more famous than she is and attracts more attention; as Bell explained, \"I hang out with Hayden quite a bit\u2014they never take pictures of me. I just step to the side, and I push myself in front of her when she wants to get out of it, or put her in the car.\"[65] Bell was a recurring guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On The Late Late Show, she shows a humorous hostility towards Craig Ferguson's robot skeleton sidekick Geoff Peterson, claiming that she had wanted to be Ferguson's sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Peterson down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five Late Late Show episodes filmed in France.[68] In January 2011, it was announced that Bell would be the new face of Neutrogena.[69] In 2019, Bell was featured on the cover of Entrepreneur magazine's April\u2013May issue.

And not out of grossness\u2014OK, a little bit out of grossness, but just nerves... I've always been a serial monogamist.\"[65] In late 2007, Bell began dating actor Dax Shepard, who is also from Metro Detroit. The couple announced their engagement in January 2010.[74] They decided to delay marriage until the state of California passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.[75] They co-starred in the 2010 film When in Rome, the 2012 film Hit and Run,[76] and the 2017 film CHiPs. After section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, Bell asked Shepard to marry her through Twitter,[77] which he accepted.[78] They were married at the Beverly Hills County Clerk's Office on October 16, 2013.[79] They have two daughters, the first born in 2013[80] and the second born in 2014.[81] At age 11, Bell became a vegetarian.[59] In an interview with PETA, Bell stated, \"I have always been an animal lover. I had a hard time disassociating the animals I cuddled with\u2014dogs and cats, for example\u2014from the animals on my plate, and I never really cared for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts!\"[82] By 2012 Bell had become vegan with her husband after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives.[83][84] During her first pregnancy, she returned to eating dairy and eggs, however.[85] During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from the Michigan Humane Society, and she now supports the San Diego-based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fundraisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has had several dogs, including a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey, and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 years old when she was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.[6][86] Bell has stated she is non-religious and identifies as a humanist.[87] Bell and other Veronica Mars cast members, including Ryan Hansen, are involved with the charity Invisible Children, Inc. The goal of the organization is to create awareness of the plight of Northern Ugandans who are caught in the midst of a civil war between the government and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army.[88] Bell has also done a public service announcement for Do Something's Healthy Living Campaign.[89] In 2014, Bell launched a Prizeo campaign offering fans a chance to win a date with her in return for donating to Invisible Children, Inc.[90] Bell supported and campaigned for Barack Obama during the 2008 United States presidential election. Along with Rashida Jones, she visited college campuses in Missouri to discuss the candidates and encourage voter registration.[91][92][93] Bell showed support for the Writers Guild of America in the writers' strike, appearing in the picket lines in December 2007, stating, \"the writers are just looking for some fairness.\"[94] Bell and her husband Dax Shepard are staunchly pro-vaccination.[95][96] In May 2016, Bell stated that she has struggled with and received treatment for depression and anxiety.[97] She said, \"It's important for me to be candid about this so people in a similar situation can realize that they are not worthless and that they do have something to offer.\"[98] In 2019, Bell and her husband Dax Shepard founded the company Hello Bello, a plant-based baby care product line. The product line focuses on creating environmentally friendly and affordable products. The company partnered exclusively with Walmart and the line is sold in all locations, as well as online.[99]",

She began her professional acting career by starring in stage productions while attending the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. In 2001, she made her Broadway debut as Becky Thatcher in the comedy musical The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and starred in the Broadway revival of The Crucible the following year. In 2004, she appeared in the action thriller film Spartan and received critical praise for her performance in the television drama film Gracie's Choice.\nBell garnered critical acclaim for her first major role as the title character in the teen noir drama television series Veronica Mars (2004\u20132007). For her performance, she was awarded a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. She reprised the eponymous role in the 2014 film continuation and the 2019 revival series. During her time on Veronica Mars, Bell starred as Mary Lane in the musical film Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005), a reprise of the role she had played in the New York musical upon which the film was based. From 2007 to 2008, Bell starred as Elle Bishop in the science fiction drama series Heroes. From 2007 to 2012, she voiced the titular narrator in the teen drama series Gossip Girl.\nIn 2008, she had her breakout film role as the title character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She has since appeared in a number of comedy films, including Couples Retreat (2009), When in Rome (2010), You Again (2010), The Boss (2016), Bad Moms (2016), and A Bad Moms Christmas (2017). Bell garnered further recognition for voicing Princess Anna in the Disney animated fantasy films Frozen (2013), Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018), and Frozen II (2019), and the short films Frozen Fever (2015) and Olaf's Frozen Adventure (2017).\nFrom 2012 to 2016, Bell starred as Jeannie van der Hooven, the female lead on the Showtime comedy series House of Lies. From 2016 to 2020, she starred in the lead role of Eleanor Shellstrop on the acclaimed NBC comedy series The Good Place, for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy.\nBell was born on July 18, 1980, in Huntington Woods, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, where she was raised. Her mother, Lorelei (n\u00e9e Frygier), is a registered nurse, and her father, Tom Bell, works as a television news director in Las Vegas, Nevada.[1][2] Her parents divorced when she was two years old, and she has two stepsisters from her father's second marriage. She also has two half-sisters and two half-brothers from her mother's second marriage.[citation needed] Her mother is of Polish descent, and her father has German, Scottish and Irish ancestry.[3]\nBell stated that she did not like her first name at the age of four. Bell's mother convinced her to go by her middle name, Anne, instead; she used the name Annie until high school.[4] Bell once broke both her wrists at the same time playing street hockey with friends.[5]\nJust before her freshman year of high school, Bell's parents decided to remove her from the public school system.[6] She attended Shrine Catholic High School in nearby Royal Oak, where she took part in the drama and music club.[7] During her time at the school, she won the starring role in the school's 1997 production of The Wizard of Oz, as Dorothy Gale, and also appeared in productions of Fiddler on the Roof (1995), Lady, Be Good (1996), and Li'l Abner (1998). In 1998, the year she graduated, Bell was named the yearbook's \"Best Looking Girl\" by senior class vote.[8]\nShortly after her high school graduation, Bell moved to New York City to attend New York University's Tisch School of the Arts,[4] majoring in musical theater.[9] In 2001, during her senior year, Bell left a few credits shy of graduating[10] to take a role in the Broadway musical version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\nIn 1992, Bell went to her first audition and won a dual role as a banana and a tree[11] in a suburban Detroit theater's production of Raggedy Ann and Andy.[4] Her mother had established her with an agent before Bell was 13, which allowed her to appear in newspaper advertisements for several Detroit retailers and television commercials. She also began private acting lessons.[4] In 1998, she appeared with an uncredited role in the locally filmed movie Polish Wedding.\nIn 2001, Bell left New York University to play a role as Becky Thatcher in the short-lived Broadway musical of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. That same year, she made her credited film debut in Pootie Tang. Her one line in the film was cut, and her appearance exists only as a scene shown during the credit sequence.[12] Additionally, she auditioned for the television series Smallville for the role of Chloe Sullivan, which was eventually won by Allison Mack.[13]\nIn 2002, she appeared in the Broadway revival of The Crucible with Liam Neeson, Angela Bettis and Laura Linney. Bell then moved to Los Angeles in 2002 because of her friendship with writers Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney,[12] and appeared in a handful of television shows as a special guest, finding trouble gaining a recurring role in a television series. Bell said she \"tested like eight times and booked nothing and every show [she] tested for got picked up\", including auditions for Skin and a Norm Macdonald series.[11]\nIn 2004, Bell appeared in the Lifetime television film Gracie's Choice, which received one of the network's highest ratings.[10] She made her debut in a theatrically released film with David Mamet's Spartan, as Laura Newton, the kidnapped daughter of the U.S. President, acting alongside Val Kilmer. Bell also guest-starred on the HBO drama Deadwood in a two-episode story arc (\"Bullock Returns to the Camp\" and \"Suffer the Little Children\").\nAt 24, she won the role of the title character in UPN's drama Veronica Mars, which was launched in the fall of 2004. Created by Rob Thomas, the series starred Bell as the seventeen-year-old anti-establishment high school student/detective. Bell drew on the parallels between the character of Veronica and her own life, since Bell's parents had divorced and her best friend had also died.[10] The series earned acclaim from television critics, as did Bell's performance. Some critics asserted that her performance was overlooked, and deserved consideration for an Emmy Award.[14][15][16]\nAside from working on Veronica Mars, Bell starred in Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical, reprising the role she played in the short-lived 2001 Off-Broadway musical. The musical was a spoof of the 1936 exploitation film of the same name. Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical debuted on the Showtime network on April 16, 2005. Also in April, Bell starred as Gracie in Fifty Pills, an entry for the Tribeca Film Festival. She appeared in a short independent film called The Receipt and the horror film Roman, which was directed by her Crucible co-star Angela Bettis. Released on August 11, 2006, Pulse starred Bell as the lead Mattie. A remake of the Japanese horror film Kairo, the film grossed US$27.9 million worldwide[17] but garnered negative response from critics. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter commented, \"despite the starring presence of Kristen Bell, [the] young actress has far less interesting material to work with here than she does as [the character] 'Veronica Mars.'\"[18]\nVeronica Mars continued on UPN for a second season; for the third season, the show was renewed and appeared on the newly created The CW. On January 19, 2007, CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff announced that while she was pleased with the gradual improvement of Veronica Mars's ratings, the series would be put on hiatus after February sweeps to air a new reality series, Pussycat Dolls Present. On May 17, 2007, Ostroff announced the cancellation of the series.[19] A two-hour series finale aired in the United States on May 22, 2007, and on June 11, 2007, Thomas officially announced in an email to TV Guide's Michael Ausiello that Veronica Mars had been canceled by the CW.[20] A Veronica Mars feature film and comic book series continuation had been discussed,[21] and for a short time there was talk of another collaboration between Bell and creator Thomas that would be unrelated to the Veronica Mars series.[19]\nFollowing the cancellation of Veronica Mars, Bell voiced interest in appearing on Heroes because she was a fan.[22] On July 29, 2007, during a train ride back to Los Angeles from the San Diego Comic-Con with Heroes actors Zachary Quinto and Masi Oka, and writers from the series, the writers had mentioned that if she \"ever want[ed] to come on Heroes, give us [writers] a call,\" to which Bell said she would \"love to.\"[23] Meanwhile, there were discussions about a role on Lost, but Bell turned down the role[24][25] of Charlotte Staples Lewis.[26] Bell portrayed Elle Bishop on Heroes, a \"mysterious young lady\" with an \"awesome power\".[23] She did not have to audition for the role of Elle,[12] who made her first appearance in an October 2007 episode, and appeared in twelve episodes during the run of the series.[27] The casting of Bell, Heroes creator Tim Kring explained, \"was not easy to pull off\", but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, \"we found a way to jump into a small window in [Bell's] schedule.\"[27] Bell lent her voice to the CW series Gossip Girl: she voiced the title character in every episode of the series, appearing in person only for a surprise cameo in the final episode, portraying herself.\nShortly after the cancellation of Veronica Mars in early 2007, Bell filmed on location in Hawaii for a starring role as the title character in the Judd Apatow comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She regarded the improvisational comedy in the film as \"a lovely experience\".[12] The film, written by and also starring Jason Segel, was released theatrically on April 18, 2008, and greatly increased Bell's profile. Bell lent her voice and likeness to the video game Assassin's Creed, which was released on November 13, 2007, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and April 8, 2008, for the PC.[28] Bell reprised her role of Lucy in Assassin's Creed II released on November 17, 2009, and again in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, released on November 16, 2010.[29] In the spring of 2006, she finished filming the Star Wars-themed comedy Fanboys. Director Kyle Newman received additional funding to shoot new scenes, but the busy schedules of the actors only allowed for filming in September 2007. As a result, the release was delayed until January 14, 2008.[30] Bell also starred in the 2009 comedies Serious Moonlight, alongside Meg Ryan, and Couples Retreat, which chronicles four couples who partake in therapy sessions at a tropical island resort. Jason Bateman played her husband.[31] She also provided the voice for Cora in Astro Boy. On March 31, 2008, Bell began shooting the Mark Steven Johnson-written Disney film When in Rome on location in Rome and New York; the film was released in 2010.[32] Bell reprised her role as Sarah Marshall for a cameo appearance in the film Get Him to the Greek, a spin-off sequel from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, released June 4, 2010.\nShe co-starred with singers Christina Aguilera and Cher in the musical film Burlesque, which was released on Thanksgiving in 2010. Bell had a cameo in the slasher horror film Scream 4, which was released on April 15, 2011.[33]\nIn 2012, Bell starred in the family drama film Big Miracle. She has also appeared in the music video for \"Madder Red\" by Brooklyn experimental rock band Yeasayer. Bell portrayed Mary Magdalene in The Truth &amp; Life Dramatized Audio New Testament Bible, a 22-hour, celebrity-voiced, dramatized audio adaptation of the New Testament that uses the RSV-CE translation.\nBell starred as Jeannie van der Hooven, the female lead on the Showtime comedy series House of Lies, which premiered on January 8, 2012. The series ended on June 12, 2016. Bell appeared in a supporting role in the science-fiction comedy Safety Not Guaranteed (2012). She starred in the drama film The Lifeguard, written and directed by Liz W. Garcia, which began filming in July 2012 and was released in August 2013.[34] She also voiced Anna in Frozen, which was released on November 22, 2013. In 2013, for multiple episodes, Bell played Ingrid de Forest, an Eagleton City Councilwoman, on Parks and Recreation.\nOn March 13, 2013, it was confirmed that a Veronica Mars film would finally be coming to fruition. Bell and series creator Rob Thomas launched a fundraising campaign to produce the film through Kickstarter and attained the $2 million goal in less than ten hours.[35] The main cast members of the series all reprised their roles in the feature film. Production of the film took place during summer 2013, and it was released theatrically and on video-on-demand on March 14, 2014.[36][37]\nIn September 2014, Bell starred with her husband, Dax Shepard, in a commercial for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S.[38] It was so popular (with over 20 million YouTube views) that they did another for the holiday season.[39] The ad agency McKinney was behind both.[40] In 2016, Bell voiced the sloth Priscilla in the animated comedy film Zootopia, and starred as Claire in the comedy film The Boss. Bell starred as Kiki in the 2016 comedy film Bad Moms, a role she reprised in the 2017 sequel, A Bad Moms Christmas.[41] In 2016, Bell began starring as Eleanor Shellstrop in the NBC comedy series The Good Place.[42]\nAlso in 2017, she appeared in the biographical comedy-drama The Disaster Artist, the action comedy CHiPs and the comedy How to Be a Latin Lover. In November 2017, she played a housewife (with Dax Shepard as her husband) preparing for a Christmas party in Sia's music video for \"Santa's Coming For Us\".[43]\nIn 2018, she began hosting the web series Momsplaining with Kristen Bell, with episodes airing on the Ellen DeGeneres video platform Ellentube. In the series, Bell gives new and expecting mothers tips about motherhood. The title of the series is a pun on the commonly used term \"mansplaining\".[44][45][46] Bell later had the leading role in the Netflix comedy-drama film Like Father. She also voiced the character of Jade Wilson in the animated comedy film Teen Titans Go! To the Movies and reprised her voice role as Princess Anna in the animated comedy sequel film Ralph Breaks the Internet.[47]\nOn September 20, 2018, Hulu confirmed that Bell would reprise her role of Veronica Mars in an 8-episode fourth season of the drama series Veronica Mars. The series debuted in July 2019.[48] In 2019, she again reprised her role of Princess Anna in the video game, Kingdom Hearts III[49] and the sequel, Frozen II[50] which was released on November 22, 2019.[51] Bell served as host and executive producer on the Disney+ docuseries Encore!, which premiered in November 2019.[52] She made her directorial debut with the eighth episode of the fourth season of The Good Place.[53] The series concluded after its fourth season, airing its final episode in January 2020.[54]\nBell is set to voice a main character in the Apple TV+ animated musical comedy series Central Park, which reunites her with Frozen co-star Josh Gad.[55] She will also voice a character in the animated musical series Do, Re, &amp; Mi.[56] It was announced that Bell will star alongside Leslie Jones as pair of housewives who create a $40 million coupon scam in the comedy film Queenpins.[57]\nIn 2006 and again in 2013,[58] Bell was selected \"World's Sexiest Vegetarian\" on PETA's yearly poll.[59] She was placed No. 68 on Maxim's 2005 \"Hot 100\" list,[60] No. 11 in Maxim's 2006 \"Hot 100\" list,[61] and No. 46 in Maxim's 2007 \"Hot 100\" list in which she was stated to have \"single-handedly saved The CW from becoming the worst network ever.\"[62] In 2006, Maxim also placed Bell at the top of the \"Fall TV's Criminally Sexy Investigators\" List.[59] In 2008, she was featured at No. 59 on AskMen's Top 99 Women of 2008 List.[63] Reflecting on her admitted popularity with \"geeks\", Bell was voted the fourth-sexiest woman on TV by the staff at Wizard magazine.[64]\nBell stated she never thought of herself as womanly because \"I always play and look and act 10 years younger than I am.\" However, she said, \"Something magical happened when I turned 25\u2014I looked in the mirror and was like, 'You might not get carded for an R-rated movie anymore.' Like I didn't have a little stick figure anymore.\"[65] Bell has said that many of her characters are tomboys because she was \"not homely enough to play the nerdy girl and not nearly pretty enough to play the pretty girl\".[65]\nBell has been associated with the idea that \"nerdy is the new cool\", and she explained, \"what was previously perceived as nerdy is now viewed as original. What I like about nerdiness, geekiness, is it doesn't really matter what you're into\u2014it just means you're not a follower.\"[65] She has also said, \"I love nerds. Comic-Con junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow. Isn't that funny? The tables have turned.\"[12] Vanessa Juarez of Entertainment Weekly commented that Bell's roles on Veronica Mars, Heroes and as a Star Wars fanatic in Fanboys have \"solidif[ied] her placement at the center of the geek universe,\" while Rodney Rothman stated, \"I guess she's cornered the market on losers.\"[66] Bell's work is often compared to Sarah Michelle Gellar's portrayal of the title character on the cult television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[67] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter stated that Bell was \"arguably the television successor [to Gellar's portrayal of Buffy] when it comes to fighting bad guys.\" Bell is sometimes confused with Lauren Conrad from The Hills. \"Yeah, sometimes fans yell, 'Hey, Lauren' to me, but usually from a distance,\" said Bell.[18]\nDespite \"new celebrity\" status, Bell claimed that she was not concerned because \"no one ever recognizes me anyway\". She has said that her friend Hayden Panettiere is more famous than she is and attracts more attention; as Bell explained, \"I hang out with Hayden quite a bit\u2014they never take pictures of me. I just step to the side, and I push myself in front of her when she wants to get out of it, or put her in the car.\"[65]\nBell was a recurring guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On The Late Late Show, she shows a humorous hostility towards Craig Ferguson's robot skeleton sidekick Geoff Peterson, claiming that she had wanted to be Ferguson's sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Peterson down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five Late Late Show episodes filmed in France.[68]\nIn January 2011, it was announced that Bell would be the new face of Neutrogena.[69]\nIn 2019, Bell was featured on the cover of Entrepreneur magazine's April\u2013May issue.

And not out of grossness\u2014OK, a little bit out of grossness, but just nerves... I've always been a serial monogamist.\"[65]\nIn late 2007, Bell began dating actor Dax Shepard, who is also from Metro Detroit. The couple announced their engagement in January 2010.[74] They decided to delay marriage until the state of California passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.[75] They co-starred in the 2010 film When in Rome, the 2012 film Hit and Run,[76] and the 2017 film CHiPs. After section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, Bell asked Shepard to marry her through Twitter,[77] which he accepted.[78] They were married at the Beverly Hills County Clerk's Office on October 16, 2013.[79] They have two daughters, the first born in 2013[80] and the second born in 2014.[81]\nAt age 11, Bell became a vegetarian.[59] In an interview with PETA, Bell stated, \"I have always been an animal lover. I had a hard time disassociating the animals I cuddled with\u2014dogs and cats, for example\u2014from the animals on my plate, and I never really cared for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts!\"[82] By 2012 Bell had become vegan with her husband after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives.[83][84] During her first pregnancy, she returned to eating dairy and eggs, however.[85] During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from the Michigan Humane Society, and she now supports the San Diego-based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fundraisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has had several dogs, including a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey, and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 years old when she was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.[6][86]\nBell has stated she is non-religious and identifies as a humanist.[87] Bell and other Veronica Mars cast members, including Ryan Hansen, are involved with the charity Invisible Children, Inc. The goal of the organization is to create awareness of the plight of Northern Ugandans who are caught in the midst of a civil war between the government and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army.[88] Bell has also done a public service announcement for Do Something's Healthy Living Campaign.[89] In 2014, Bell launched a Prizeo campaign offering fans a chance to win a date with her in return for donating to Invisible Children, Inc.[90]\nBell supported and campaigned for Barack Obama during the 2008 United States presidential election. Along with Rashida Jones, she visited college campuses in Missouri to discuss the candidates and encourage voter registration.[91][92][93] Bell showed support for the Writers Guild of America in the writers' strike, appearing in the picket lines in December 2007, stating, \"the writers are just looking for some fairness.\"[94]\nBell and her husband Dax Shepard are staunchly pro-vaccination.[95][96]\nIn May 2016, Bell stated that she has struggled with and received treatment for depression and anxiety.[97] She said, \"It's important for me to be candid about this so people in a similar situation can realize that they are not worthless and that they do have something to offer.\"[98]\nIn 2019, Bell and her husband Dax Shepard founded the company Hello Bello, a plant-based baby care product line. The product line focuses on creating environmentally friendly and affordable products. The company partnered exclusively with Walmart and the line is sold in all locations, as well as online.[99]\n\n</body></html>"

She is of German, Scottish and English descent.[7]\nRitter was scouted by a modeling agent at her local shopping mall, the Wyoming Valley Mall, at the age of 15, at a modeling event. Ritter described herself at the time as \"tall, gawky, awkward, and really, really skinny\" to Philadelphia Style magazine. While in high school, she traveled to New York City on her days off and began modeling there and in Philadelphia. She signed with the Elite Model Management agency and then with Wilhelmina Models.[5] Ritter moved to New York City at the age of 18 and established an international-modeling career in print ads and on television. She did magazine, catalog, and runway work in Milan, New York, Paris, and Tokyo.[8]\nRitter's acting career began when Wilhelmina placed her for an audition for a Dr Pepper television commercial. Ritter told Philadelphia Style that she felt her \"outgoing and bubbly and funny\" personality as a performer helped her transition into acting naturally by letting her entertain the casting people.[5] She won several bit film roles starting in 2001, and then played a 1950s art history student in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). In 2006, she appeared in All This Intimacy, a two-act, Off-Broadway play by Rajiv Joseph, at the Second Stage Theatre.[9] Ritter signed on to star in the premiere of Zach Braff's play, All New People, at Second Stage Theatre. Anna Camp, David Wilson Barnes and Justin Bartha co-starred in the production under the direction of Peter DuBois.[10]\nRitter had a number of guest starring roles on television, and appeared on the second season of Veronica Mars, playing Gia Goodman, the daughter of mayor Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg). Ritter guest-starred on Gilmore Girls for eight episodes from 2006 to 2007 as Rory Gilmore's friend, Lucy. She also played the first iteration of Allison Stark on the Fox sitcom 'Til Death (which eventually had four actresses play that role through its run).\nRitter continued working in film, often cast as the best friend of the lead character. In 2008, she had supporting roles in the romantic comedies What Happens in Vegas and 27 Dresses. She co-starred in the 2009 film Confessions of a Shopaholic as Suze, the best friend of Isla Fisher's character. Ritter spent three months shooting She's Out of My League in Pittsburgh in 2008. She played Patty, the cynical best friend of Alice Eve's character Molly.[8]\nRitter was cast as a young Carol Rhodes in an episode of The CW's teen drama series Gossip Girl titled \"Valley Girls\", which aired May 11, 2009.[11] The episode was a backdoor pilot for a proposed spin-off series of the same title, set in 1980s Los Angeles, that would chronicle the teenage years of the character Lily van der Woodsen.[12] Ritter described her character Carol, Lily's sister, as \"the outcast\", and \"an '80s Sunset Strip rocker\" to Access Hollywood.[13] The series was not picked up by the network for the 2009\u201310 season.[14]\nRitter co-starred as Jane Margolis on the second season of AMC's drama series Breaking Bad,[12] and starred in the film How to Make Love to a Woman (2009), based on a best-selling book by adult film star Jenna Jameson. She also co-starred with Jason Behr in the independent film The Last International Playboy (2009), as Ozzy, a drug addict.[15] Ritter sold a television pilot that she wrote based on her experiences as a model, named Model Camp.[16] She appeared in the comedy web series Woke Up Dead in 2009, playing Cassie alongside Jon Heder as Drex.[17]\nIn 2010, Ritter starred in the television series Gravity alongside Ivan Sergei, Ving Rhames, and Rachel Hunter, playing the sharp and quirky Lily.[18] The Starz comedy-drama centers on a group of out-patient suicide survivors.[19] She starred opposite Ben Barnes in the 2011 comedy film Killing Bono as the manager of an Irish band.[18] Directed by Nick Hamm, the film is based on Killing Bono: I Was Bono's Doppleganger, a book about the early days of the Irish rock band U2.[20] Beginning in January 2010, the film's shoot lasted for six weeks and moved from Belfast to London before returning to Belfast.[21]\nRitter starred alongside Alicia Silverstone in the comedy horror film Vamps, written and directed by Amy Heckerling.

                "text": "no title\n\nDaniel Peter Masterson (born March 13, 1976)[1] is an American actor, active Scientologist, and disc jockey.[2] Masterson played the roles of Steven Hyde in That '70s Show (1998\u20132006) and Jameson \"Rooster\" Bennett in The Ranch (2016\u20132018). Masterson was born on Long Island, New York, the son of Carol, a manager, and Peter Masterson, an insurance agent.[3] He grew up in Garden City and East Williston, New York.[4] He has one brother, actor Christopher Masterson. Their maternal half siblings Jordan Masterson and Alanna Masterson are also actors. He also has a paternal half-brother, Will Masterson.[citation needed] A child model from age four, who was featured in magazine articles as well as television commercials beginning at age five, Masterson starred in musicals as a child at the age of eight, and began acting as well. His singing voice \"disappeared\" by the time he was a teenager. By the time he was sixteen, he had appeared in over one-hundred commercials,[5] including ones for Swift Premium,[citation needed] Kellogg's Frosted Flakes,[citation needed] Hardee's,[6] Hostess, Tang,[7] and Clearasil.[8] In the early 1990s, Masterson had a role in Beethoven's 2nd, and starred as Justin in Cybill. After starring in the third and fourth seasons of Cybill, Masterson decided he wanted to move on from Cybill and audition for a show originally titled Teenage Wasteland, which later was changed to That '70s Show.[9] The original casting director for That '70s Show, Debby Romano, resisted Masterson's audition because he was slightly older than the rest of the cast, but ultimately allowed him to audition. She stated that, \"he came in and he was just so funny,\" and that he redefined where the role was going and made the role of Steven Hyde the, \"tough, funny guy.\"[citation needed] Masterson appeared in all eight seasons of That '70s Show. His appearance on That '70s Show launched a breakthrough in Masterson's career, allowing him to pursue other endeavours between tapings. After the show concluded Masterson starred in several movies and made guest appearances on television shows including Punk'd and MADtv. Along with Kutcher and Valderrama, he co-hosted the Fox TV special Woodstock 1999. He had a role in the 2008 comedy Yes Man. Masterson stars with his real-life wife, Bijou Phillips, in the 2009 drama The Bridge to Nowhere. In 2011, Masterson guest starred as James Roland in USA Network's White Collar (episode \"Where There's A Will\"). He portrayed Jerry Rubin in the 2010 movie, The Chicago 8, written and directed by Pinchas Perry. The Chicago 8 is a film based on the actual Chicago Eight in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and explores the events around the trial. It was filmed in September and October 2009. The film is based closely on the trial transcripts and most of the action takes place in the courtroom.[10] In 2012, the comedy series Men At Work premiered on TBS, co-starring Masterson and Michael Cassidy, James Lesure and Adam Busch.[11] In 2012, Masterson appeared in the film Alter Egos, directed by Jordan Galland.[12] Masterson starred alongside Sam Elliott, Ashton Kutcher, and Elisha Cuthbert in the Netflix comedy series The Ranch. Masterson began DJing at Los Angeles night clubs in 1997 as a hobby, under the name DJ Donkey Punch, but it soon became a side business. He currently goes by the name DJ Mom Jeans.[13] Masterson is a self-described \"rock and hip hop fanatic,\"[9] and is also a fan of indie, electro, and funk music, all of which he primarily DJs with.[13][6] For a time, Masterson owned a lounge and bar in Park City, Utah, called Downstairs.[14][15] He appeared as part of a poker team, the Unabombers, the 2005 GSN series The James Woods Gang vs. The Unabombers.[16] He has hosted celebrity poker events, such as the Phat Farm Stuff Casino Weekend Poker Tournament, in which he won the tournament.[17] Masterson is a Scientologist.[18][19] He started dating Bijou Phillips in 2005,[20] they became engaged in 2009,[21] and married on October 18, 2011.[22] Their daughter, Fianna Francis Masterson was born on February 14, 2014.[23][24][25] In March 2017, four women filed rape allegations against Masterson prompting a Los Angeles Police Department investigation.[2] Masterson, through his agent, has denied the allegations, and Masterson has not been charged or arrested. In response to the accusations, Netflix fired Masterson from its comedy series The Ranch on December 5, 2017, saying in a statement, \"Yesterday was his last day on the show, and production will resume in early 2018 without him.\" Masterson stated that he is \"obviously very disappointed in Netflix's decision to write my character off of The Ranch.\"[26] A fifth woman who dated Masterson made similar rape accusations in December 2017.[27] He was dropped as a client by United Talent Agency.[28][29][30] A planned 2019 episode of Leah Remini's show Aftermath, focusing on the Masterson rape allegations, was delayed due to what one of Masterson's accusers characterized as pressure from the Church of Scientology.[31] The episode eventually aired on August 27, 2019. [32] Cedric Bixler-Zavala, singer for the bands The Mars Volta and At the Drive-In, alleged that Masterson sexually assaulted his wife Chrissie Carnell Bixler, and stated his band's song \"Incurably Innocent\" (from the 2017 album In\u2022ter a\u2022li\u2022a) is about the incident.[33][34][35] In August 2019, four women filed a lawsuit against Masterson and the Church of Scientology for stalking and harassment, stemming from their rape allegations. One plaintiff claims her dog mysteriously died from (unexplained) traumatic injuries to its trachea and esophagus; she also alleges that church members chased her as she drove her car, filmed her without permission, harassed her online and posted ads to social media sites soliciting sex in her name. Another plaintiff stated that she and her neighbors observed a man snapping pictures from her driveway and later that night someone broke a window in her 13-year-old daughter's bedroom.[36][37][30] Such stalking and harassment claims are indicative of a Scientology term titled Fair Game, which was officially cancelled by L. Ron Hubbard in 1968; but the plaintiffs lawyers claim it continues through 'outsourcing' to private investigators and off duty police officers, to any detractors and ex-members of the church.[38][39] Masterson has since responded to one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit claiming \"I\u2019m not going to fight my ex-girlfriend in the media like she\u2019s been baiting me to do for more than two years. I will beat her in court\u2014and look forward to it because the public will finally be able learn the truth and see how I\u2019ve been railroaded by this woman and once her lawsuit is thrown out, I intend to sue her and the others who jumped on the bandwagon for the damage they caused me and my family.\" He has not addressed the stalking or harassment claims.[36][40] On January 22nd, 2020, Cedric Bixler-Zavala of The Mars Volta & At The Drive-In reported that a second of his family pets had to be put down due to being fed rat poison wrapped inside a rolled up piece of raw meat alleging that this was done by Scientologists in response to his repeated public statements alleging Masterson of raping his wife (who was one of the four women who filed suit against Masterson). Masterson has yet to directly respond to any of Bixler-Zavala's claims or his prior rape allegations made by Chrissie Carnell Bixler with the closest acknowledgement being Masterson's wife Bijou Phillips making an Instagram post mocking Carnell Bixlers court papers against Masterson.[41][42][43][44]",

Their maternal half siblings Jordan Masterson and Alanna Masterson are also actors. He also has a paternal half-brother, Will Masterson.[citation needed]\nA child model from age four, who was featured in magazine articles as well as television commercials beginning at age five, Masterson starred in musicals as a child at the age of eight, and began acting as well. His singing voice \"disappeared\" by the time he was a teenager. By the time he was sixteen, he had appeared in over one-hundred commercials,[5] including ones for Swift Premium,[citation needed] Kellogg's Frosted Flakes,[citation needed] Hardee's,[6] Hostess, Tang,[7] and Clearasil.[8]\nIn the early 1990s, Masterson had a role in Beethoven's 2nd, and starred as Justin in Cybill. After starring in the third and fourth seasons of Cybill, Masterson decided he wanted to move on from Cybill and audition for a show originally titled Teenage Wasteland, which later was changed to That '70s Show.[9] The original casting director for That '70s Show, Debby Romano, resisted Masterson's audition because he was slightly older than the rest of the cast, but ultimately allowed him to audition. She stated that, \"he came in and he was just so funny,\" and that he redefined where the role was going and made the role of Steven Hyde the, \"tough, funny guy.\"[citation needed]\nMasterson appeared in all eight seasons of That '70s Show. His appearance on That '70s Show launched a breakthrough in Masterson's career, allowing him to pursue other endeavours between tapings. After the show concluded Masterson starred in several movies and made guest appearances on television shows including Punk'd and MADtv. Along with Kutcher and Valderrama, he co-hosted the Fox TV special Woodstock 1999. He had a role in the 2008 comedy Yes Man. Masterson stars with his real-life wife, Bijou Phillips, in the 2009 drama The Bridge to Nowhere.\nIn 2011, Masterson guest starred as James Roland in USA Network's White Collar (episode \"Where There's A Will\"). He portrayed Jerry Rubin in the 2010 movie, The Chicago 8, written and directed by Pinchas Perry. The Chicago 8 is a film based on the actual Chicago Eight in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and explores the events around the trial. It was filmed in September and October 2009. The film is based closely on the trial transcripts and most of the action takes place in the courtroom.[10]\nIn 2012, the comedy series Men At Work premiered on TBS, co-starring Masterson and Michael Cassidy, James Lesure and Adam Busch.[11] In 2012, Masterson appeared in the film Alter Egos, directed by Jordan Galland.[12]\nMasterson starred alongside Sam Elliott, Ashton Kutcher, and Elisha Cuthbert in the Netflix comedy series The Ranch.\nMasterson began DJing at Los Angeles night clubs in 1997 as a hobby, under the name DJ Donkey Punch, but it soon became a side business. He currently goes by the name DJ Mom Jeans.[13] Masterson is a self-described \"rock and hip hop fanatic,\"[9] and is also a fan of indie, electro, and funk music, all of which he primarily DJs with.[13][6]\nFor a time, Masterson owned a lounge and bar in Park City, Utah, called Downstairs.[14][15]\nHe appeared as part of a poker team, the Unabombers, the 2005 GSN series The James Woods Gang vs. The Unabombers.[16] He has hosted celebrity poker events, such as the Phat Farm Stuff Casino Weekend Poker Tournament, in which he won the tournament.[17]\nMasterson is a Scientologist.[18][19] He started dating Bijou Phillips in 2005,[20] they became engaged in 2009,[21] and married on October 18, 2011.[22] Their daughter, Fianna Francis  Masterson was born on February 14, 2014.[23][24][25]\nIn March 2017, four women filed rape allegations against Masterson prompting a Los Angeles Police Department investigation.[2] Masterson, through his agent, has denied the allegations, and Masterson has not been charged or arrested. In response to the accusations, Netflix fired Masterson from its comedy series The Ranch on December 5, 2017, saying in a statement, \"Yesterday was his last day on the show, and production will resume in early 2018 without him.\" Masterson stated that he is \"obviously very disappointed in Netflix's decision to write my character off of The Ranch.\"[26] A fifth woman who dated Masterson made similar rape accusations in December 2017.[27] He was dropped as a client by United Talent Agency.[28][29][30]\nA planned 2019 episode of Leah Remini's show Aftermath, focusing on the Masterson rape allegations, was delayed due to what one of Masterson's accusers characterized as pressure from the Church of Scientology.[31] The episode eventually aired on August 27, 2019. [32]\nCedric Bixler-Zavala, singer for the bands The Mars Volta and At the Drive-In, alleged that Masterson sexually assaulted his wife Chrissie Carnell Bixler, and stated his band's song \"Incurably Innocent\" (from the 2017 album In\u2022ter a\u2022li\u2022a) is about the incident.[33][34][35]\nIn August 2019, four women filed a lawsuit against Masterson and the Church of Scientology for stalking and harassment, stemming from their rape allegations. One plaintiff claims her dog mysteriously died from (unexplained) traumatic injuries to its trachea and esophagus; she also alleges that church members chased her as she drove her car, filmed her without permission, harassed her online and posted ads to social media sites soliciting sex in her name. Another plaintiff stated that she and her neighbors observed a man snapping pictures from her driveway and later that night someone broke a window in her 13-year-old daughter's bedroom.[36][37][30] Such stalking and harassment claims are indicative of a Scientology term titled Fair Game, which was officially cancelled by L. Ron Hubbard in 1968; but the plaintiffs lawyers claim it continues through 'outsourcing' to private investigators and off duty police officers, to any detractors and ex-members of the church.[38][39] Masterson has since responded to one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit claiming \"I\u2019m not going to fight my ex-girlfriend in the media like she\u2019s been baiting me to do for more than two years. I will beat her in court\u2014and look forward to it because the public will finally be able learn the truth and see how I\u2019ve been railroaded by this woman and once her lawsuit is thrown out, I intend to sue her and the others who jumped on the bandwagon for the damage they caused me and my family.\" He has not addressed the stalking or harassment claims.[36][40]\nOn January 22nd, 2020, Cedric Bixler-Zavala of The Mars Volta &amp; At The Drive-In reported that a second of his family pets had to be put down due to being fed rat poison wrapped inside a rolled up piece of raw meat alleging that this was done by Scientologists in response to his repeated public statements alleging Masterson of raping his wife (who was one of the four women who filed suit against Masterson). Masterson has yet to directly respond to any of Bixler-Zavala's claims or his prior rape allegations made by Chrissie Carnell Bixler with the closest acknowledgement being Masterson's wife Bijou Phillips making an Instagram post mocking Carnell Bixlers court papers against Masterson.[41][42][43][44]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nBuzz Aldrin (/\u02c8\u0254\u02d0ldr\u026an/; born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr.; January 20, 1930) is an American engineer, former astronaut and fighter pilot. Aldrin made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission, and as the lunar module pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, he and mission commander Neil Armstrong were the first two humans to land on the Moon. Born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the United States Military Academy at West Point, with a degree in mechanical engineering. He was commissioned into the United States Air Force, and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War. He flew 66 combat missions and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft. After earning a Sc.D. degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA's Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, earning him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12 during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. A Presbyterian elder, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion. Upon leaving NASA in 1971, Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. He retired from the Air Force in 1972, after 21 years of service. His autobiographies Return to Earth (1973), and Magnificent Desolation (2009), recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. He continued to advocate for space exploration, particularly a human mission to Mars, and developed the Aldrin cycler, a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to Mars more efficient in regard to time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, and is listed in several Halls of Fame. Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. was born on January 20, 1930, at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.[1] His parents, Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr. and Marion Aldrin (n\u00e9e Moon), lived in neighboring Montclair.[2] His father was an Army aviator during World War I and the assistant commandant of the Army's test pilot school at McCook Field, Ohio, from 1919 to 1922, but left the Army in 1928 and became an executive at Standard Oil.[3] Aldrin had two siblings, both sisters: Madeleine, who was four years older, and Fay Ann, who was a year and a half older.[4] His nickname, which became his legal first name in 1988,[5][6] arose as a result of Fay's mispronouncing \"brother\" as \"buzzer\", which was then shortened to \"Buzz\".[4][7] He was a Boy Scout, achieving the rank of Tenderfoot Scout.[8] Aldrin did well in school, maintaining an A average.[9] He played football and was the starting center for Montclair High School's undefeated 1946 state champion team.[10][11] His father wanted him to go to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland and enrolled him at nearby Severn School, a preparatory school for Annapolis and even secured him an appointment from Albert W. Hawkes, one of the United States Senators from New Jersey.[12] Aldrin attended Severn School in 1946,[13] but had other ideas about his future career. He suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes. He faced down his father and told him to ask Hawkes to change the nomination to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.[12] Aldrin entered West Point in 1947.[5] He did well academically, finishing first in his class his plebe (first) year.[9] He was a member of the academy track and field team.[14] In 1950, he traveled with a group of West Point cadets to Japan and the Philippines to study the military government policies of Douglas MacArthur.[15] During his trip, the Korean War broke out.[16] On June 5, 1951, he graduated third in the class of 1951 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering.[17] As one of the highest-ranking members of the class, Aldrin had his choice of assignments. He chose the United States Air Force, which had become a separate service in 1947 while Aldrin was still at West Point and did not yet have its own academy.[18][19] He was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and underwent basic flight training in T-6 Texans at Bartow Air Base in Florida. His classmates included Sam Johnson, who later became a prisoner of war in Vietnam; the two became friends. At one point, Aldrin attempted a double Immelmann turn in a T-28 Trojan and suffered a grayout. He recovered in time to pull out at 200 feet (61\u00a0m), averting what would have been a fatal crash.[20] When Aldrin was deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly, his father advised him to choose bombers, because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills, which could open up better prospects for career advancement. Aldrin chose instead to fly fighters. He moved to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, where he learned to fly the F-80 Shooting Star and the F-86 Sabre. Like most jet fighter pilots of the era, he preferred the latter.[20] In December 1952, Aldrin was assigned to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was part of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. At the time it was based at Suwon Air Base, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) south of Seoul, and was engaged in combat operations as part of the Korean War.[17][21] During an acclimatization flight his main fuel system froze at 100\u00a0percent power, which would have soon used up all his fuel. He was able to override the setting manually, but this required holding a button down, which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio. He barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence. He flew 66 combat missions in F-86 Sabres in Korea and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.[21][22] The first Mig-15 he shot down was on May 14, 1953. Aldrin was flying about 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) south of the Yalu River, when he saw two MiG-15 fighters below him. Aldrin opened fire on one of the MiGs, whose pilot may never have seen him coming.[21][23] The June 8, 1953, issue of Life magazine featured gun camera footage taken by Aldrin of the pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft.[24] Aldrin's second aerial victory came on June 4, 1953, when he accompanied aircraft from the 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in an attack on an airbase in North Korea. Their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up. He then spotted a MiG approaching from above. This time, Aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about the same time. They went through a series of scissor maneuvers, attempting to get behind the other. Aldrin was first to do so, but his gun sight jammed. He then manually sighted his gun and fired. He then had to pull out, as the two aircraft had gotten too low for the dogfight to continue. Aldrin saw the MiG's canopy open and the pilot eject, although Aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open.[23][25] For his service in Korea, he was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and three Air Medals.[26] Aldrin's year-long tour ended in December 1953, by which time the fighting in Korea had ended. Aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at Nellis.[17] In December 1954 he became an aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Don Z. Zimmerman, the Dean of Faculty at the nascent United States Air Force Academy, which opened in 1955.[27][28] That same year, he graduated from the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.[29] From 1956 to 1959 he flew F-100 Super Sabres equipped with nuclear weapons as a flight commander in the 22nd Fighter Squadron, 36th Fighter Wing, stationed at Bitburg Air Base in West Germany.[17][23][27] Among his squadron colleagues was Ed White, who had been a year behind him at West Point. After White left Germany to study for a master's degree at the University of Michigan in aeronautical engineering, he wrote to Aldrin encouraging him to do the same.[14] Through the Air Force Institute of Technology, Aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959, intending to earn a master's degree.[30] His astrodynamics class was taught by Richard Battin. Two other USAF officers who later became astronauts, David Scott and Edgar Mitchell took this course around this time, while another, Charles Duke wrote his 1964 master's degree at MIT under the supervision of Laurence R. Young.[31] Aldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead.[30] In January 1963, he earned a Sc.D. degree in astronautics.[27][32] His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, the dedication of which read: \"In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country's present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!\"[32] Aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in the hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut, although it meant foregoing test pilot training, which was a prerequisite at the time.[30] On the completion of his doctorate, Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Los Angeles,[14] working with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation on enhancing the maneuver capabilities of the Agena target vehicle which was to be used by NASA's Project Gemini. He was then posted to the Space Systems Division's field office at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, where he was involved in integrating Department of Defense experiments into Project Gemini flights.[33] Aldrin's initial application to join the astronaut corps when NASA's Astronaut Group 2 was selected in 1962 was rejected on the grounds that he was not a test pilot. He was aware of the requirement and asked for it to be waived, but the request was turned down.[34] On May 15, 1963, NASA announced another round of selections, this time with the requirement that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1,000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft.[35] Aldrin had over 2,500 hours of flying time, of which 2,200 was in jets.[33] His selection as one of fourteen members of NASA's Astronaut Group 3 was announced on October 18, 1963.[36] This made him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree which, combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics, earned him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from his fellow astronauts.[37][38][39] Aldrin was aware it was not always intended as a compliment.[14] Upon completion of initial training, each new astronaut was assigned a field of expertise\u00a0\u2013 in Aldrin's case, it was mission planning, trajectory analysis and flight plans.[40][41] Jim Lovell and Aldrin were selected as the backup crew of Gemini 10, commander and pilot respectively. Backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission, but the last scheduled mission in the program was Gemini 12.[42] The February 28, 1966, deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, in an air crash, led to Lovell and Aldrin being moved up one mission to backup for Gemini 9, which put them in position as prime crew for Gemini 12.[43][44] They were designated its prime crew on June 17, 1966, with Gordon Cooper and Gene Cernan as their backups.[45] Initially, Gemini 12's mission objectives were uncertain. As the last scheduled mission, it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions.[46] While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous during Project Gemini, the gravity-gradient stabilization test on Gemini 11 was unsuccessful. NASA also had concerns about extravehicular activity (EVA). Cernan on Gemini\u00a09 and Richard Gordon on Gemini\u00a011 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during EVA, but Michael Collins had a successful EVA on Gemini 10, which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor.[47][48] It therefore fell to Aldrin to complete Gemini's EVA goals. NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success. It dropped the test of the Air Force's astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) that had given Gordon trouble on Gemini\u00a011 so Aldrin could focus on EVA. NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over parabolic flight. Aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training, but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest. It also encouraged performing tasks quickly, whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately. Training in a viscous, buoyant fluid gave a better simulation. NASA also placed additional handholds on the capsule, which were increased from nine on Gemini\u00a09 to 44 on Gemini\u00a012, and created workstations where he could anchor his feet.[47][48] Gemini 12's main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization, perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three EVAs, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. Gemini\u00a012 also carried 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments.[49] It was not a trailblazing mission; rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by Gemini 9, and the tethered vehicle exercise by Gemini 11. Even gravity-gradient stabilization had been attempted by Gemini 11, albeit unsuccessfully.[48] Gemini\u00a012 was launched from Launch Complex 19 at Cape Canaveral on 20:46 UTC on November 11, 1966. The Gemini Agena Target Vehicle had been launched about an hour and a half before.[49] The mission's first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle. As the target and Gemini\u00a012 capsule drew closer together, radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable, forcing the crew to rendezvous manually. Aldrin used a sextant and rendezvous charts he helped create to give Lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to dock with the target vehicle.[50] Gemini\u00a012 achieved the fourth docking with an Agena target vehicle.[51] The next task was to practice undocking and docking again. On undocking, one of the three latches caught, and Lovell had to use the Gemini's thrusters to free the spacecraft. Aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later. The flight plan then called for the Agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit, but eight minutes after the Agena had been launched, it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure. The Mission and Flight Directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine. This would be the only mission objective that was not achieved.[51] Instead, the Agena's secondary propulsion system was used to allow the spacecraft to view the solar eclipse of November 12, 1966, over South America, which Lovell and Aldrin photographed through the spacecraft windows.[49] Aldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and twenty minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. Aldrin performed numerous tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for Project Apollo. A dozen two-minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued. His second EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.[49][52] On November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, where they were picked up by a helicopter, which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier USS\u00a0Wasp.[49][53] After the mission, his wife realized he had fallen into a depression, something she had not seen before.[50] Lovell and Aldrin were assigned to an Apollo crew with Neil Armstrong as Commander, Lovell as Command Module Pilot (CMP), and Aldrin as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). Their assignment as the backup crew of Apollo 9 was announced on November 20, 1967.[54] Due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 and Apollo\u00a09 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Under the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was expected to command Apollo 11.[55] Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo\u00a08 prime crew, required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine.[56] Lovell took his place on the Apollo\u00a08 crew. When Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.[57] While the CMP usually occupied the center couch on launch, Aldrin occupied it rather than Collins, as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before Collins arrived.[58] Apollo\u00a011 was the second American space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space,[59] the first being Apollo 10.[60] The next would not be flown until STS-26 in 1988.[59] Deke Slayton, who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments, gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong thought it over for a day before declining. He had no issues working with Aldrin, and thought Lovell deserved his own command.[61] Early versions of the EVA checklist had the Lunar Module Pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[62] Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".[63] Aldrin and Armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training. The first lunar landing focused more on landing on the Moon and making it safely back to Earth than the scientific aspects of the mission. The duo were briefed by NASA and USGS geologists. They made one geological field trip to West Texas. The press followed them, and a helicopter made it hard for Aldrin and Armstrong to hear their instructor.[64] On the morning of July 16, 1969, an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo\u00a011 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more listened to radio broadcasts.[65][66] Propelled by a Saturn V rocket, Apollo\u00a011 lifted off from Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 EDT),[67] and entered Earth orbit twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About thirty minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the command module Columbia from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with lunar module Eagle. After the lunar module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.[68] On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo\u00a011 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit.[68] In the thirty orbits that followed,[69] the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquillity about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of the crater Sabine D.[70] At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered Eagle, and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 Eagle separated from the Columbia.[68] Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear had correctly deployed.[71][72] Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the Eagle.[73] Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800\u00a0m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM guidance computer (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[74] The Eagle landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[75] As a Presbyterian elder, Aldrin was the first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. He radioed Earth: \"I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.\"[76] Using a kit given to him by his pastor,[77] he took communion and read Jesus's words from the New Testament's John 15:5, as Aldrin records it: \"I am the vine. You are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.\"[78] But he kept this ceremony secret because of a lawsuit over the reading of Genesis on Apollo 8.[79] In 1970 he commented: \"It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.\"[80] On reflection in his 2009 book, Aldrin said, \"Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind \u2013 be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo\u00a011 experience than by giving thanks to God.\"[81] Aldrin shortly hit upon a more universally human reference on the voyage back to Earth by publicly broadcasting his reading of the Old Testament's Psalm 8:3\u20134, as Aldrin records: \"When I considered the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him.\"[82] Photos of these liturgical documents reveal the conflict's development as Aldrin expresses faith.[83] Preparations for the EVA began at 23:43.[68] Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, and the hatch was opened at 02:39:33 on July 21.[68][84] Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface.[68] Armstrong and Aldrin became the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. Aldrin's first words after he set foot on the Moon were \"Beautiful view\", to which Armstrong asked \"Isn't that something? Magnificent sight out here.\" Aldrin answered, \"Magnificent desolation.\"[85] Aldrin and Armstrong had trouble erecting the Lunar Flag Assembly, but with some effort secured it into the surface. Aldrin saluted the flag and Armstrong took an iconic photo of the scene. Aldrin positioned himself in front of the video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about the lunar surface to aid future moonwalkers.[86] During his experiments, President Nixon called the duo to congratulate them on the successful landing. Nixon closed with, \"Thank you very much, and all of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.\"[87] Aldrin replied, \"I look forward to that very much, sir.\"[87][88] After the call, Aldrin began photographing and inspecting the spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight. Aldrin and Armstrong then set up a seismometer to detect moonquakes and a laser beam reflector. While Armstrong inspected a crater, Aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample.[89] Most of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the Moon taken by the Apollo\u00a011 astronauts are of Aldrin; Armstrong appears in just two color photographs. \"As the sequence of lunar operations evolved,\" Aldrin explained, \"Neil had the camera most of the time, and the majority of the pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn't until we were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this during our training.\"[90] Aldrin reentered Eagle first, but, before ascending the ladder, he was the first human to urinate on the Moon.[91] With some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5\u00a0lb) of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device.[92] Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. It contained a mission patch for the Apollo 1 flight that Ed White never flew due to his death in a cabin fire during the launch rehearsal; medallions commemorating Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and Vladimir Komarov, the first man to die in a space flight, and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations.[93] After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01, and they repressurized the lunar module and settled down to sleep.[94] At 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.[68] After rendezvous with Columbia, the ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit, and Columbia made its way back to Earth.[95] It splashed down in the Pacific 2,660\u00a0km (1,440\u00a0nmi) east of Wake Island at 16:50 UTC (05:50 local time) on July 24.[68][96] The total mission duration was 195 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds.[97] The chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered a remote possibility, so divers passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter, and flown to the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0Hornet,[98] where they spent the first part of the Earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine.[99] On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million people.[100] An official state dinner that evening in Los Angeles celebrated the flight. President Richard Nixon honored each of them with the highest American civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (with distinction).[101][102] On September 16, 1969, the astronauts addressed a joint session of Congress where they thanked the representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding the space effort.[103][104] The astronauts embarked on a 38-day world tour on September 29 that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries.[105] The last leg of the tour included Australia, South Korea, and Japan; the crew returned to the US on November 5, 1969.[106][107] After Apollo 11, Aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances. In October 1970, he joined Soviet cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov on their tour of the NASA space centers. He was also involved in the design of the Space Shuttle. With the Apollo program coming to an end, Aldrin, now a colonel, saw few prospects at NASA, and decided to return to the Air Force on July 1, 1971.[108] During his NASA career, he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space, of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in EVA.[27] Aldrin hoped to become Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, but the job went to his West Point classmate Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr. Aldrin was made Commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience, but a third of the training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified F-104 Starfighter to the edge of space.[109] Fellow Group 3 astronaut and moonwalker Alan Bean considered him well qualified for the job.[110] Aldrin did not get along well with his superior, Brigadier General Robert M. White, who had earned his USAF astronaut wings flying the X-15. Aldrin's celebrity status led people to defer to him more than the higher-ranking general.[111] There were two crashes at Edwards, of an A-7 Corsair II and a T-33. No lives were lost, but the aircraft were destroyed and the accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision, which placed the blame on Aldrin. What he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful one.[112] Aldrin went to see the base surgeon. In addition to signs of depression, he experienced neck and shoulder pains, and hoped that the latter might explain the former.[113] He was hospitalized for depression at Wilford Hall Medical Center for four weeks.[114] His mother had committed suicide in May 1968, and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after Gemini\u00a012 had contributed. His mother's father had also committed suicide, and he believed he inherited depression from them.[115] At the time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career-ending, but could result in his being ostracized socially.[113] In February 1972, General George S. Brown paid a visit to Edwards and informed Aldrin that the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School was being renamed the USAF Test Pilot School and the astronaut training was being dropped. With the Apollo program winding down, and Air Force budgets being cut, the Air Force's interest in space diminished.[112] Aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on March 1, 1972, after 21 years of service. His father and General Jimmy Doolittle, a close friend of his father, attended the formal retirement ceremony.[112] Aldrin's father died on December 28, 1974, from complications following a heart attack.[116] Aldrin's autobiographies Return to Earth, (1973) and Magnificent Desolation (2009), recounted his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA.[117][118][119] Encouraged by a therapist to take a regular job, Aldrin worked selling used cars, at which he had no talent.[120] Periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking. Eventually he was arrested for disorderly conduct. Finally, in October 1978, he quit drinking for good. Aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems, including actor William Holden. Holden's girlfriend Stefanie Powers had portrayed Marianne, a woman with whom Aldrin had an affair, in the TV movie version of Return to Earth. Aldrin was saddened by Holden's alcohol-related death in 1981.[121] On September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a Beverly Hills hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children's television show on the subject of space.[122] When he arrived, Moon landing conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were not faked. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel followed Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, and called him \"thief, liar and coward\", the 72-year-old Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel's film crew. Aldrin said he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter. Witnesses said Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with a Bible. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no criminal record. The police declined to press charges against Aldrin.[123][124] In 2005, while being interviewed for a Science Channel documentary titled First on the Moon: The Untold Story, Aldrin told an interviewer they had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO). The documentary makers omitted the crew's conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels from the upper stage of the Saturn\u00a0V rocket. The panels had been jettisoned before the separation maneuver so they closely followed the spacecraft until the first mid-course correction. When Aldrin appeared on The Howard Stern Show on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, \"99.9 percent\" sure the object was the detached panel.[126][127] According to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to make a correction, but was refused.[128] In December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand.[129] At 86 years of age, Aldrin's visit made him the oldest person to reach the South Pole. He had traveled to the North Pole in 1998.[130][131] After leaving NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the University of North Dakota (UND)'s College of Aerospace Sciences at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college. Aldrin helped to develop UND's Space Studies program and brought Dr. David Webb from NASA to serve as the department's first chair.[132] To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, Talib Kweli, and Soulja Boy to create the rap single and video \"Rocket Experience\", proceeds from which were donated to Aldrin's non-profit foundation, ShareSpace.[133] In 1985, Aldrin proposed a special spacecraft trajectory now known as the Aldrin cycler.[134][135] Cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to Mars by using less propellant. The Aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, with a return trip to Earth of the same duration on a twin cycler orbit. Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University.[136] In 1996 Aldrin founded Starcraft Boosters, Inc. (SBI) to design reusable rocket launchers.[137] In December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in The New York Times criticizing NASA's objectives. In it, he voiced concern about NASA's development of a spacecraft \"limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability\" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was \"more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs\".[138] In a June 2013 opinion piece in The New York Times, Aldrin supported a human mission to Mars and which viewed the Moon \"not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.\"[139] In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the Florida Institute of Technology, presented a master plan to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a tour of duty of ten years, establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.[140] Aldrin was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1969 for his role as lunar module pilot on Apollo 11.[141] He was awarded an oak leaf cluster in 1972 in lieu of a second DSM for his role in both the Korean War and in the space program,[141] and the Legion of Merit for his role in the Gemini and Apollo programs.[141] During a 1966 ceremony marking the end of the Gemini program, Aldrin was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal by President Johnson at LBJ Ranch.[142] He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1970 for the Apollo\u00a011 mission.[143] Aldrin was one of ten Gemini astronauts inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982.[144][145] He was also inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1993,[146][147] the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2000,[148] and the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2008.[149] The Toy Story character Buzz Lightyear was named in honor of Buzz Aldrin.[150] In 1999, while celebrating the 30th anniversary of the lunar landing, Vice-President Al Gore, who was also the vice-chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, presented the Apollo\u00a011 crew with the Smithsonian Institution's Langley Gold Medal for aviation. After the ceremony, the crew went to the White House and presented President Bill Clinton with an encased Moon rock.[151][152] The Apollo\u00a011 crew was awarded the New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda in 2011. During the ceremony, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said, \"Those of us who have had the privilege to fly in space followed the trail they forged.\"[153][154] The Apollo\u00a011 crew were awarded the Collier Trophy in 1969. The National Aeronautic Association president awarded a duplicate trophy to Collins and Aldrin at a ceremony.[155] The crew was awarded the 1969 General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy.[156] The National Space Club named the crew the winners of the 1970 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy, awarded annually for the greatest achievement in spaceflight.[157] They received the international Harmon Trophy for aviators in 1970,[158][159] conferred to them by Vice-President Spiro Agnew in 1971.[160] Agnew also presented them the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society in 1970. He told them, \"You've won a place alongside Christopher Columbus in American history\".[161] In 1970, the Apollo\u00a011 team were co-winners of the Iven C. Kincheloe award from the Society of Experimental Test Pilots along with Darryl Greenamyer who broke the world speed record for piston engine airplanes.[162] For contributions to the television industry, they were honored with round plaques on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[163] In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Aldrin to the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry.[164] Aldrin received the 2003 Humanitarian Award from Variety, the Children's Charity, which, according to the organization, \"is given to an individual who has shown unusual understanding, empathy, and devotion to mankind.\"[165] In 2006, the Space Foundation awarded him its highest honor, the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.[166] Aldrin received honorary degrees from six colleges and universities,[27] and was named as the Chancellor of the International Space University in 2015.[167] He was a member of the National Space Society's Board of Governors,[168] and has served as the organization's chairman. In 2016, his hometown middle school in Montclair, New Jersey, was renamed Buzz Aldrin Middle School.[169] The Aldrin crater on the Moon near the Apollo\u00a011 landing site and Asteroid 6470 Aldrin are named in his honor.[144] Aldrin has been married three times. His first marriage was on December 29, 1954, to Joan Archer, a Rutgers University and Columbia University alumna with a master's degree. They had three children, James, Janice and Andrew. They filed for divorce in 1974.[170][171] His second was to Beverly Van Zile, whom he married on December 31, 1975,[172] and divorced in 1978. His third was to Lois Driggs Cannon, whom he married on February 14, 1988.[173] Their divorce was finalized in December 2012. The settlement included 50\u00a0percent of their $475,000 bank account, and $9,500 a month plus 30\u00a0percent of his annual income, estimated at more than $600,000.[174][175] As of 2017, he has one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter Janice, and three great-grandsons.[176] In 2018 Aldrin was involved in a legal dispute with his children Andrew and Janice and former business manager Christina Korp over their claims that he was mentally impaired through dementia and Alzheimer's disease. His children alleged that he made new friends who were alienating him from the family and encouraging him to spend his savings at a high rate. They sought to be named legal guardians so they could control his finances.[177] In June, Aldrin filed a lawsuit against Andrew, Janice, Korp, and businesses and foundations run by the family.[178] Aldrin alleged that Janice was not acting in his financial interests and that Korp was exploiting the elderly. He sought to remove Andrew's control of Aldrin's social media accounts, finances, and businesses. The situation ended when his children withdrew their petition and he dropped the lawsuit in March 2019, several months before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo\u00a011 mission.[179] Aldrin is an active supporter of the Republican Party, headlining fundraisers for its members of Congress[180] and endorsing its candidates. He appeared at a rally for George W. Bush in 2004 and campaigned for Nick Lampson in Texas in 2006, Paul Rancatore in Florida in 2008, Mark Treadwell in Alaska in 2014[181] and Dan Crenshaw in Texas in 2018.[182] He appeared at the 2019 State of the Union Address as a guest of President Donald Trump.[183] Following the 2012 death of his Apollo\u00a011 colleague Neil Armstrong, Aldrin said he was .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}deeply saddened by the passing\u00a0... I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew\u00a0... I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing.[184] In 2007, he confirmed to Time magazine that he had recently had a face-lift, joking that the g-forces he was exposed to in space \"caused a sagging jowl that needed some attention.\"[185] He primarily resided in the Los Angeles area, including Beverly Hills and Laguna Beach and Emerald Bay.[186] Following his third divorce, he sold his Westwood condominium.[187] As of 2018[update], he was living in Satellite Beach, Florida.[188][189] Aldrin has been portrayed by:",

Aldrin made three spacewalks as pilot of the 1966 Gemini 12 mission, and as the lunar module pilot on the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, he and mission commander Neil Armstrong were the first two humans to land on the Moon.\nBorn in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Aldrin graduated third in the class of 1951 from the United States Military Academy at West Point, with a degree in mechanical engineering. He was commissioned into the United States Air Force, and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War. He flew 66 combat missions and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.\nAfter earning a Sc.D. degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA's Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, earning him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12 during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. A Presbyterian elder, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion.\nUpon leaving NASA in 1971, Aldrin became Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. He retired from the Air Force in 1972, after 21 years of service. His autobiographies Return to Earth (1973), and Magnificent Desolation (2009), recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA. He continued to advocate for space exploration, particularly a human mission to Mars, and developed the Aldrin cycler, a special spacecraft trajectory that makes travel to Mars more efficient in regard to time and propellant. He has been accorded numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, and is listed in several Halls of Fame.\nEdwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. was born on January 20, 1930, at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.[1] His parents, Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr. and Marion Aldrin (n\u00e9e Moon), lived in neighboring Montclair.[2] His father was an Army aviator during World War I and the assistant commandant of the Army's test pilot school at McCook Field, Ohio, from 1919 to 1922, but left the Army in 1928 and became an executive at Standard Oil.[3] Aldrin had two siblings, both sisters: Madeleine, who was four years older, and Fay Ann, who was a year and a half older.[4] His nickname, which became his legal first name in 1988,[5][6] arose as a result of Fay's mispronouncing \"brother\" as \"buzzer\", which was then shortened to \"Buzz\".[4][7] He was a Boy Scout, achieving the rank of Tenderfoot Scout.[8]\nAldrin did well in school, maintaining an A average.[9] He played football and was the starting center for Montclair High School's undefeated 1946 state champion team.[10][11] His father wanted him to go to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland and enrolled him at nearby Severn School, a preparatory school for Annapolis and even secured him an appointment from Albert W. Hawkes, one of the United States Senators from New Jersey.[12] Aldrin attended Severn School in 1946,[13] but had other ideas about his future career. He suffered from seasickness and considered ships a distraction from flying airplanes. He faced down his father and told him to ask Hawkes to change the nomination to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.[12]\nAldrin entered West Point in 1947.[5] He did well academically, finishing first in his class his plebe (first) year.[9] He was a member of the academy track and field team.[14] In 1950, he traveled with a group of West Point cadets to Japan and the Philippines to study the military government policies of Douglas MacArthur.[15] During his trip, the Korean War broke out.[16] On June 5, 1951, he graduated third in the class of 1951 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering.[17]\nAs one of the highest-ranking members of the class, Aldrin had his choice of assignments. He chose the United States Air Force, which had become a separate service in 1947 while Aldrin was still at West Point and did not yet have its own academy.[18][19] He was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and underwent basic flight training in T-6 Texans at Bartow Air Base in Florida. His classmates included Sam Johnson, who later became a prisoner of war in Vietnam; the two became friends. At one point, Aldrin attempted a double Immelmann turn in a T-28 Trojan and suffered a grayout. He recovered in time to pull out at 200 feet (61\u00a0m), averting what would have been a fatal crash.[20]\nWhen Aldrin was deciding what sort of aircraft he should fly, his father advised him to choose bombers, because command of a bomber crew gave an opportunity to learn and hone leadership skills, which could open up better prospects for career advancement. Aldrin chose instead to fly fighters. He moved to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, where he learned to fly the F-80 Shooting Star and the F-86 Sabre. Like most jet fighter pilots of the era, he preferred the latter.[20]\nIn December 1952, Aldrin was assigned to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was part of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. At the time it was based at Suwon Air Base, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) south of Seoul, and was engaged in combat operations as part of the Korean War.[17][21] During an acclimatization flight his main fuel system froze at 100\u00a0percent power, which would have soon used up all his fuel. He was able to override the setting manually, but this required holding a button down, which in turn made it impossible to also use his radio. He barely managed to make it back under enforced radio silence. He flew 66 combat missions in F-86 Sabres in Korea and shot down two MiG-15 aircraft.[21][22]\nThe first Mig-15 he shot down was on May 14, 1953. Aldrin was flying about 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) south of the Yalu River, when he saw two MiG-15 fighters below him. Aldrin opened fire on one of the MiGs, whose pilot may never have seen him coming.[21][23] The June 8, 1953, issue of Life magazine featured gun camera footage taken by Aldrin of the pilot ejecting from his damaged aircraft.[24]\nAldrin's second aerial victory came on June 4, 1953, when he accompanied aircraft from the 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in an attack on an airbase in North Korea. Their newer aircraft were faster than his and he had trouble keeping up. He then spotted a MiG approaching from above. This time, Aldrin and his opponent spotted each other at about the same time. They went through a series of scissor maneuvers, attempting to get behind the other. Aldrin was first to do so, but his gun sight jammed. He then manually sighted his gun and fired. He then had to pull out, as the two aircraft had gotten too low for the dogfight to continue. Aldrin saw the MiG's canopy open and the pilot eject, although Aldrin was uncertain whether there was sufficient time for a parachute to open.[23][25] For his service in Korea, he was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and three Air Medals.[26]\nAldrin's year-long tour ended in December 1953, by which time the fighting in Korea had ended. Aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at Nellis.[17] In December 1954 he became an aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Don Z. Zimmerman, the Dean of Faculty at the nascent United States Air Force Academy, which opened in 1955.[27][28] That same year, he graduated from the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.[29] From 1956 to 1959 he flew F-100 Super Sabres equipped with nuclear weapons as a flight commander in the 22nd Fighter Squadron, 36th Fighter Wing, stationed at Bitburg Air Base in West Germany.[17][23][27] Among his squadron colleagues was Ed White, who had been a year behind him at West Point. After White left Germany to study for a master's degree at the University of Michigan in aeronautical engineering, he wrote to Aldrin encouraging him to do the same.[14]\nThrough the Air Force Institute of Technology, Aldrin enrolled as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959, intending to earn a master's degree.[30] His astrodynamics class was taught by Richard Battin. Two other USAF officers who later became astronauts, David Scott and Edgar Mitchell took this course around this time, while another, Charles Duke wrote his 1964 master's degree at MIT under the supervision of Laurence R. Young.[31]\nAldrin enjoyed the classwork and soon decided to pursue a doctorate instead.[30] In January 1963, he earned a Sc.D. degree in astronautics.[27][32] His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, the dedication of which read: \"In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this country's present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!\"[32] Aldrin chose his doctoral thesis in the hope that it would help him be selected as an astronaut, although it meant foregoing test pilot training, which was a prerequisite at the time.[30]\nOn the completion of his doctorate, Aldrin was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Los Angeles,[14] working with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation on enhancing the maneuver capabilities of the Agena target vehicle which was to be used by NASA's Project Gemini. He was then posted to the Space Systems Division's field office at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, where he was involved in integrating Department of Defense experiments into Project Gemini flights.[33]\nAldrin's initial application to join the astronaut corps when NASA's Astronaut Group 2 was selected in 1962 was rejected on the grounds that he was not a test pilot. He was aware of the requirement and asked for it to be waived, but the request was turned down.[34] On May 15, 1963, NASA announced another round of selections, this time with the requirement that applicants had either test pilot experience or 1,000 hours of flying time in jet aircraft.[35] Aldrin had over 2,500 hours of flying time, of which 2,200 was in jets.[33] His selection as one of fourteen members of NASA's Astronaut Group 3 was announced on October 18, 1963.[36] This made him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree which, combined with his expertise in orbital mechanics, earned him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from his fellow astronauts.[37][38][39] Aldrin was aware it was not always intended as a compliment.[14] Upon completion of initial training, each new astronaut was assigned a field of expertise\u00a0\u2013  in Aldrin's case, it was mission planning, trajectory analysis and flight plans.[40][41]\nJim Lovell and Aldrin were selected as the backup crew of Gemini 10, commander and pilot respectively. Backup crews usually became the prime crew of the third following mission, but the last scheduled mission in the program was Gemini 12.[42] The February 28, 1966, deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, in an air crash, led to Lovell and Aldrin being moved up one mission to backup for Gemini 9, which put them in position as prime crew for Gemini 12.[43][44] They were designated its prime crew on June 17, 1966, with Gordon Cooper and Gene Cernan as their backups.[45]\nInitially, Gemini 12's mission objectives were uncertain. As the last scheduled mission, it was primarily intended to complete tasks that had not been successfully or fully carried out on earlier missions.[46] While NASA had successfully performed rendezvous during Project Gemini, the gravity-gradient stabilization test on Gemini 11 was unsuccessful. NASA also had concerns about extravehicular activity (EVA). Cernan on Gemini\u00a09 and Richard Gordon on Gemini\u00a011 had suffered from fatigue carrying out tasks during EVA, but Michael Collins had a successful EVA on Gemini 10, which suggested that the order in which he had performed his tasks was an important factor.[47][48]\nIt therefore fell to Aldrin to complete Gemini's EVA goals. NASA formed a committee to give him a better chance of success. It dropped the test of the Air Force's astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) that had given Gordon trouble on Gemini\u00a011 so Aldrin could focus on EVA. NASA revamped the training program, opting for underwater training over parabolic flight. Aircraft flying a parabolic trajectory had given astronauts an experience of weightlessness in training, but there was a delay between each parabola which gave astronauts several minutes of rest. It also encouraged performing tasks quickly, whereas in space they had to be done slowly and deliberately. Training in a viscous, buoyant fluid gave a better simulation. NASA also placed additional handholds on the capsule, which were increased from nine on Gemini\u00a09 to 44 on Gemini\u00a012, and created workstations where he could anchor his feet.[47][48]\nGemini 12's main objectives were to rendezvous with a target vehicle, and fly the spacecraft and target vehicle together using gravity-gradient stabilization, perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise and three EVAs, and demonstrate an automatic reentry. Gemini\u00a012 also carried 14 scientific, medical, and technological experiments.[49] It was not a trailblazing mission; rendezvous from above had already been successfully performed by Gemini 9, and the tethered vehicle exercise by Gemini 11. Even gravity-gradient stabilization had been attempted by Gemini 11, albeit unsuccessfully.[48]\nGemini\u00a012 was launched from Launch Complex 19 at Cape Canaveral on 20:46 UTC on November 11, 1966. The Gemini Agena Target Vehicle had been launched about an hour and a half before.[49] The mission's first major objective was to rendezvous with this target vehicle. As the target and Gemini\u00a012 capsule drew closer together, radar contact between the two deteriorated until it became unusable, forcing the crew to rendezvous manually. Aldrin used a sextant and rendezvous charts he helped create to give Lovell the right information to put the spacecraft in position to dock with the target vehicle.[50] Gemini\u00a012 achieved the fourth docking with an Agena target vehicle.[51]\nThe next task was to practice undocking and docking again. On undocking, one of the three latches caught, and Lovell had to use the Gemini's thrusters to free the spacecraft. Aldrin then docked again successfully a few minutes later. The flight plan then called for the Agena main engine to be fired to take the docked spacecraft into a higher orbit, but eight minutes after the Agena had been launched, it had suffered a loss of chamber pressure. The Mission and Flight Directors therefore decided not to risk the main engine. This would be the only mission objective that was not achieved.[51] Instead, the Agena's secondary propulsion system was used to allow the spacecraft to view the solar eclipse of November 12, 1966, over South America, which Lovell and Aldrin photographed through the spacecraft windows.[49]\nAldrin performed three EVAs. The first was a standup EVA on November 12, in which the spacecraft door was opened and he stood up, but did not leave the spacecraft. The standup EVA mimicked some of the actions he would do during his free-flight EVA, so he could compare the effort expended between the two. It set an EVA record of two hours and twenty minutes. The next day Aldrin performed his free-flight EVA. He climbed across the newly installed hand-holds to the Agena and installed the cable needed for the gravity-gradient stabilization experiment. Aldrin performed numerous tasks, including installing electrical connectors and testing tools that would be needed for Project Apollo. A dozen two-minute rest periods prevented him from becoming fatigued. His second EVA concluded after two hours and six minutes. A third, 55-minute standup EVA was conducted on November 14, during which Aldrin took photographs, conducted experiments, and discarded some unneeded items.[49][52]\nOn November 15, the crew initiated the automatic reentry system and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, where they were picked up by a helicopter, which took them to the awaiting aircraft carrier USS\u00a0Wasp.[49][53] After the mission, his wife realized he had fallen into a depression, something she had not seen before.[50]\nLovell and Aldrin were assigned to an Apollo crew with Neil Armstrong as Commander, Lovell as Command Module Pilot (CMP), and Aldrin as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). Their assignment as the backup crew of Apollo 9 was announced on November 20, 1967.[54] Due to design and manufacturing delays in the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 and Apollo\u00a09 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Under the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was expected to command Apollo 11.[55]\nMichael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo\u00a08 prime crew, required surgery to remove a bone spur on his spine.[56] Lovell took his place on the Apollo\u00a08 crew. When Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.[57] While the CMP usually occupied the center couch on launch, Aldrin occupied it rather than Collins, as he had already been trained to operate its console on liftoff before Collins arrived.[58]\nApollo\u00a011 was the second American space mission made up entirely of astronauts who had already flown in space,[59] the first being Apollo 10.[60] The next would not be flown until STS-26 in 1988.[59] Deke Slayton, who was responsible for astronaut flight assignments, gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong thought it over for a day before declining. He had no issues working with Aldrin, and thought Lovell deserved his own command.[61]\nEarly versions of the EVA checklist had the Lunar Module Pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[62] Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".[63]\nAldrin and Armstrong did not have time to perform much geological training. The first lunar landing focused more on landing on the Moon and making it safely back to Earth than the scientific aspects of the mission. The duo were briefed by NASA and USGS geologists. They made one geological field trip to West Texas. The press followed them, and a helicopter made it hard for Aldrin and Armstrong to hear their instructor.[64]\nOn the morning of July 16, 1969, an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo\u00a011 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more listened to radio broadcasts.[65][66] Propelled by a Saturn V rocket, Apollo\u00a011 lifted off from Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 EDT),[67] and entered Earth orbit twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon. About thirty minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the command module Columbia from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with lunar module Eagle. After the lunar module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.[68]\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo\u00a011 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit.[68] In the thirty orbits that followed,[69] the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquillity about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of the crater Sabine D.[70] At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered Eagle, and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 Eagle separated from the Columbia.[68] Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear had correctly deployed.[71][72]\nThroughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the Eagle.[73] Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800\u00a0m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM guidance computer (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected alarms that indicated that it could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[74] The Eagle landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[75]\nAs a Presbyterian elder, Aldrin was the first and only person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. He radioed Earth: \"I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.\"[76] Using a kit given to him by his pastor,[77] he took communion and read Jesus's words from the New Testament's John 15:5, as Aldrin records it: \"I am the vine. You are the branches. Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you can do nothing without me.\"[78] But he kept this ceremony secret because of a lawsuit over the reading of Genesis on Apollo 8.[79] In 1970 he commented: \"It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.\"[80] On reflection in his 2009 book, Aldrin said, \"Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind \u2013 be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo\u00a011 experience than by giving thanks to God.\"[81] Aldrin shortly hit upon a more universally human reference on the voyage back to Earth by publicly broadcasting his reading of the Old Testament's Psalm 8:3\u20134, as Aldrin records: \"When I considered the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him.\"[82] Photos of these liturgical documents reveal the conflict's development as Aldrin expresses faith.[83]\nPreparations for the EVA began at 23:43.[68] Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, and the hatch was opened at 02:39:33 on July 21.[68][84] Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface.[68] Armstrong and Aldrin became the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. Aldrin's first words after he set foot on the Moon were \"Beautiful view\", to which Armstrong asked \"Isn't that something? Magnificent sight out here.\" Aldrin answered, \"Magnificent desolation.\"[85] Aldrin and Armstrong had trouble erecting the Lunar Flag Assembly, but with some effort secured it into the surface. Aldrin saluted the flag and Armstrong took an iconic photo of the scene. Aldrin positioned himself in front of the video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion methods to move about the lunar surface to aid future moonwalkers.[86] During his experiments, President Nixon called the duo to congratulate them on the successful landing. Nixon closed with, \"Thank you very much, and all of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.\"[87] Aldrin replied, \"I look forward to that very much, sir.\"[87][88]\nAfter the call, Aldrin began photographing and inspecting the spacecraft to document and verify its condition before their flight. Aldrin and Armstrong then set up a seismometer to detect moonquakes and a laser beam reflector. While Armstrong inspected a crater, Aldrin began the difficult task of hammering a metal tube into the surface to obtain a core sample.[89]\nMost of the iconic photographs of an astronaut on the Moon taken by the Apollo\u00a011 astronauts are of Aldrin; Armstrong appears in just two color photographs. \"As the sequence of lunar operations evolved,\" Aldrin explained, \"Neil had the camera most of the time, and the majority of the pictures taken on the Moon that include an astronaut are of me. It wasn't until we were back on Earth and in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory looking over the pictures that we realized there were few pictures of Neil. My fault perhaps, but we had never simulated this during our training.\"[90]\nAldrin reentered Eagle first, but, before ascending the ladder, he was the first human to urinate on the Moon.[91] With some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5\u00a0lb) of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device.[92] Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. It contained a mission patch for the Apollo 1 flight that Ed White never flew due to his death in a cabin fire during the launch rehearsal; medallions commemorating Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and Vladimir Komarov, the first man to die in a space flight, and a silicon disk etched with goodwill messages from 73 nations.[93] After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01, and they repressurized the lunar module and settled down to sleep.[94]\nAt 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.[68] After rendezvous with Columbia, the ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit, and Columbia made its way back to Earth.[95] It splashed down in the Pacific 2,660\u00a0km (1,440\u00a0nmi) east of Wake Island at 16:50 UTC (05:50 local time) on July 24.[68][96] The total mission duration was 195 hours, 18 minutes, 35 seconds.[97]\nThe chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered a remote possibility, so divers passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter, and flown to the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0Hornet,[98] where they spent the first part of the Earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine.[99] On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million people.[100] An official state dinner that evening in Los Angeles celebrated the flight. President Richard Nixon honored each of them with the highest American civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (with distinction).[101][102]\nOn September 16, 1969, the astronauts addressed a joint session of Congress where they thanked the representatives for their past support and implored them to continue funding the space effort.[103][104] The astronauts embarked on a 38-day world tour on September 29 that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with leaders of multiple countries.[105] The last leg of the tour included Australia, South Korea, and Japan; the crew returned to the US on November 5, 1969.[106][107]\nAfter Apollo 11, Aldrin was kept busy giving speeches and making public appearances. In October 1970, he joined Soviet cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov on their tour of the NASA space centers. He was also involved in the design of the Space Shuttle. With the Apollo program coming to an end, Aldrin, now a colonel, saw few prospects at NASA, and decided to return to the Air Force on July 1, 1971.[108] During his NASA career, he had spent 289 hours and 53 minutes in space, of which 7 hours and 52 minutes was in EVA.[27]\nAldrin hoped to become Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, but the job went to his West Point classmate Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr. Aldrin was made Commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Aldrin had neither managerial nor test pilot experience, but a third of the training curriculum was devoted to astronaut training and students flew a modified F-104 Starfighter to the edge of space.[109] Fellow Group 3 astronaut and moonwalker Alan Bean considered him well qualified for the job.[110]\nAldrin did not get along well with his superior, Brigadier General Robert M. White, who had earned his USAF astronaut wings flying the X-15. Aldrin's celebrity status led people to defer to him more than the higher-ranking general.[111] There were two crashes at Edwards, of an A-7 Corsair II and a T-33. No lives were lost, but the aircraft were destroyed and the accidents were attributed to insufficient supervision, which placed the blame on Aldrin. What he had hoped would be an enjoyable job became a highly stressful one.[112]\nAldrin went to see the base surgeon. In addition to signs of depression, he experienced neck and shoulder pains, and hoped that the latter might explain the former.[113] He was hospitalized for depression at Wilford Hall Medical Center for four weeks.[114] His mother had committed suicide in May 1968, and he was plagued with guilt that his fame after Gemini\u00a012 had contributed. His mother's father had also committed suicide, and he believed he inherited depression from them.[115] At the time there was great stigma related to mental illness and he was aware that it could not only be career-ending, but could result in his being ostracized socially.[113]\nIn February 1972, General George S. Brown paid a visit to Edwards and informed Aldrin that the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School was being renamed the USAF Test Pilot School and the astronaut training was being dropped. With the Apollo program winding down, and Air Force budgets being cut, the Air Force's interest in space diminished.[112] Aldrin elected to retire as a colonel on March 1, 1972, after 21 years of service. His father and General Jimmy Doolittle, a close friend of his father, attended the formal retirement ceremony.[112]\nAldrin's father died on December 28, 1974, from complications following a heart attack.[116] Aldrin's autobiographies Return to Earth, (1973) and Magnificent Desolation (2009), recounted his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after leaving NASA.[117][118][119] Encouraged by a therapist to take a regular job, Aldrin worked selling used cars, at which he had no talent.[120] Periods of hospitalization and sobriety alternated with bouts of heavy drinking. Eventually he was arrested for disorderly conduct. Finally, in October 1978, he quit drinking for good. Aldrin attempted to help others with drinking problems, including actor William Holden. Holden's girlfriend Stefanie Powers had portrayed Marianne, a woman with whom Aldrin had an affair, in the TV movie version of Return to Earth. Aldrin was saddened by Holden's alcohol-related death in 1981.[121]\nOn September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a Beverly Hills hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children's television show on the subject of space.[122] When he arrived, Moon landing conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were not faked. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel followed Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, and called him \"thief, liar and coward\", the 72-year-old Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel's film crew. Aldrin said he had acted to defend himself and his stepdaughter. Witnesses said Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with a Bible. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no criminal record. The police declined to press charges against Aldrin.[123][124]\nIn 2005, while being interviewed for a Science Channel documentary titled First on the Moon: The Untold Story, Aldrin told an interviewer they had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO). The documentary makers omitted the crew's conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels from the upper stage of the Saturn\u00a0V rocket. The panels had been jettisoned before the separation maneuver so they closely followed the spacecraft until the first mid-course correction. When Aldrin appeared on The Howard Stern Show on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, \"99.9 percent\" sure the object was the detached panel.[126][127] According to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to make a correction, but was refused.[128]\nIn December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand.[129] At 86 years of age, Aldrin's visit made him the oldest person to reach the South Pole. He had traveled to the North Pole in 1998.[130][131]\nAfter leaving NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the University of North Dakota (UND)'s College of Aerospace Sciences at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college. Aldrin helped to develop UND's Space Studies program and brought Dr. David Webb from NASA to serve as the department's first chair.[132] To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, Talib Kweli, and Soulja Boy to create the rap single and video \"Rocket Experience\", proceeds from which were donated to Aldrin's non-profit foundation, ShareSpace.[133]\nIn 1985, Aldrin proposed a special spacecraft trajectory now known as the Aldrin cycler.[134][135] Cycler trajectories offer reduced cost of repeated travel to Mars by using less propellant. The Aldrin cycler provided a five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, with a return trip to Earth of the same duration on a twin cycler orbit. Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University.[136] In 1996 Aldrin founded Starcraft Boosters, Inc. (SBI) to design reusable rocket launchers.[137]\nIn December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in The New York Times criticizing NASA's objectives. In it, he voiced concern about NASA's development of a spacecraft \"limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability\" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was \"more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs\".[138]\nIn a June 2013 opinion piece in The New York Times, Aldrin supported a human mission to Mars and which viewed the Moon \"not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.\"[139] In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the Florida Institute of Technology, presented a master plan to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a tour of duty of ten years, establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.[140]\nAldrin was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1969 for his role as lunar module pilot on Apollo 11.[141] He was awarded an oak leaf cluster in 1972 in lieu of a second DSM for his role in both the Korean War and in the space program,[141] and the Legion of Merit for his role in the Gemini and Apollo programs.[141] During a 1966 ceremony marking the end of the Gemini program, Aldrin was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal by President Johnson at LBJ Ranch.[142] He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1970 for the Apollo\u00a011 mission.[143] Aldrin was one of ten Gemini astronauts inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982.[144][145] He was also inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1993,[146][147] the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2000,[148] and the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2008.[149]\nThe Toy Story character Buzz Lightyear was named in honor of Buzz Aldrin.[150]\nIn 1999, while celebrating the 30th anniversary of the lunar landing, Vice-President Al Gore, who was also the vice-chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, presented the Apollo\u00a011 crew with the Smithsonian Institution's Langley Gold Medal for aviation. After the ceremony, the crew went to the White House and presented President Bill Clinton with an encased Moon rock.[151][152] The Apollo\u00a011 crew was awarded the New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda in 2011. During the ceremony, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said, \"Those of us who have had the privilege to fly in space followed the trail they forged.\"[153][154]\nThe Apollo\u00a011 crew were awarded the Collier Trophy in 1969. The National Aeronautic Association president awarded a duplicate trophy to Collins and Aldrin at a ceremony.[155] The crew was awarded the 1969 General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy.[156] The National Space Club named the crew the winners of the 1970 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy, awarded annually for the greatest achievement in spaceflight.[157] They received the international Harmon Trophy for aviators in 1970,[158][159] conferred to them by Vice-President Spiro Agnew in 1971.[160] Agnew also presented them the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society in 1970. He told them, \"You've won a place alongside Christopher Columbus in American history\".[161] In 1970, the Apollo\u00a011 team were co-winners of the Iven C. Kincheloe award from the Society of Experimental Test Pilots along with Darryl Greenamyer who broke the world speed record for piston engine airplanes.[162] For contributions to the television industry, they were honored with round plaques on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[163]\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Aldrin to the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry.[164] Aldrin received the 2003 Humanitarian Award from Variety, the Children's Charity, which, according to the organization, \"is given to an individual who has shown unusual understanding, empathy, and devotion to mankind.\"[165] In 2006, the Space Foundation awarded him its highest honor, the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.[166]\nAldrin received honorary degrees from six colleges and universities,[27] and was named as the Chancellor of the International Space University in 2015.[167] He was a member of the National Space Society's Board of Governors,[168] and has served as the organization's chairman. In 2016, his hometown middle school in Montclair, New Jersey, was renamed Buzz Aldrin Middle School.[169] The Aldrin crater on the Moon near the Apollo\u00a011 landing site and Asteroid 6470 Aldrin are named in his honor.[144]\nAldrin has been married three times. His first marriage was on December 29, 1954, to Joan Archer, a Rutgers University and Columbia University alumna with a master's degree. They had three children, James, Janice and Andrew. They filed for divorce in 1974.[170][171] His second was to Beverly Van Zile, whom he married on December 31, 1975,[172] and divorced in 1978. His third was to Lois Driggs Cannon, whom he married on February 14, 1988.[173] Their divorce was finalized in December 2012. The settlement included 50\u00a0percent of their $475,000 bank account, and $9,500 a month plus 30\u00a0percent of his annual income, estimated at more than $600,000.[174][175] As of 2017, he has one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter Janice, and three great-grandsons.[176]\nIn 2018 Aldrin was involved in a legal dispute with his children Andrew and Janice and former business manager Christina Korp over their claims that he was mentally impaired through dementia and Alzheimer's disease. His children alleged that he made new friends who were alienating him from the family and encouraging him to spend his savings at a high rate. They sought to be named legal guardians so they could control his finances.[177] In June, Aldrin filed a lawsuit against Andrew, Janice, Korp, and businesses and foundations run by the family.[178] Aldrin alleged that Janice was not acting in his financial interests and that Korp was exploiting the elderly. He sought to remove Andrew's control of Aldrin's social media accounts, finances, and businesses. The situation ended when his children withdrew their petition and he dropped the lawsuit in March 2019, several months before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo\u00a011 mission.[179]\nAldrin is an active supporter of the Republican Party, headlining fundraisers for its members of Congress[180] and endorsing its candidates. He appeared at a rally for George W. Bush in 2004 and campaigned for Nick Lampson in Texas in 2006, Paul Rancatore in Florida in 2008, Mark Treadwell in Alaska in 2014[181] and Dan Crenshaw in Texas in 2018.[182] He appeared at the 2019 State of the Union Address as a guest of President Donald Trump.[183]\n\nFollowing the 2012 death of his Apollo\u00a011 colleague Neil Armstrong, Aldrin said he was .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}deeply saddened by the passing\u00a0... I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew\u00a0... I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing.[184]\nIn 2007, he confirmed to Time magazine that he had recently had a face-lift, joking that the g-forces he was exposed to in space \"caused a sagging jowl that needed some attention.\"[185] He primarily resided in the Los Angeles area, including Beverly Hills and Laguna Beach and Emerald Bay.[186] Following his third divorce, he sold his Westwood condominium.[187] As of 2018[update], he was living in Satellite Beach, Florida.[188][189]\nAldrin has been portrayed by:\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nElon Reeve Musk FRS (/\u02c8i\u02d0l\u0252n/; born June 28, 1971) is an engineer and technology entrepreneur.[2][3][4] He is a citizen of South Africa, Canada, and the United States (where he resides permanently) and is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer/designer of SpaceX;[5] co-founder, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;[6][7] founder of The Boring Company;[8] co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI.[9] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[10][11] In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People,[12] and was ranked joint first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019.[13] He has a net worth of $44.5 billion and is listed by Forbes as the 23rd-richest person in the world.[1] He is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[14] Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a Bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue an entrepreneurial career. He subsequently co-founded Zip2 with his brother Kimbal, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.[6][15][16][17] In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded,[6] and became its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of SolarCity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain\u2013computer interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company focused on tunnels specialized for electric vehicles. Apart from Tesla, Musk is not an investor in the stock market.[18] In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop, and has proposed a vertical take-off and landing supersonic jet electric aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet.[19] Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.[20] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on Mars.[21][22] Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,[23] the son of Maye Musk (n\u00e9e\u00a0Haldeman), a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[24] and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28] His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.[29][30] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[31][32] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[31] a choice made by Musk two years after his parents separated but which he subsequently regretted.[33] Musk is estranged from his father whom he has referred to as \"a terrible human being\".[33] He has a half-sister[34] and a half-brother.[35] During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[36] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[37] He taught himself computer programming and, by the age of 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[38][39] A web version of the game is available online.[38][40] His childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that \"you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one\".[33] Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost consciousness.[33] The damage to his nose required corrective surgery.[36][41] Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School[41] before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United States, saying \"I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible, more than any other country in the world.\"[42] Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th\u00a0birthday,[43] after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[44][45] Elon Musk, [46] While awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[47] Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[48][49] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage; and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.[50] His work at Rocket Science Games involved assembly programming of device drivers. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple\u2019s QuickTime who had hired Musk noted: \u201cHe had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.\u201d[51] In 1995, Musk commenced a PhD in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California. Eager to pursue opportunities in the Internet boom, he dropped out after just two days to launch his first company, Zip2 Corporation.[52] In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of angel investors.[33] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions and yellow pages.[53][54] The vector graphics mapping and direction code was implemented by Musk in Java.[55] Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune[56] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[57] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[36] Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307\u00a0million in cash[36]:109 and US$34\u00a0million in stock options[citation needed] in February 1999.[58] Musk received US$22\u00a0million for his 7 percent share from the sale.[56][36]:109 In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10\u00a0million from the sale of Zip2.[43][53][57] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[56][59] which had a money-transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service.[60] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.[61] In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5\u00a0billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165\u00a0million.[62] Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.[63] In July 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has sentimental value to him.[64] In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.[65][66] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[67] The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8\u00a0million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[67] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[68] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that, in theory, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed in software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.[69] Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.[70] With US$100\u00a0million of his early fortune,[71] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002.[72] Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of the Hawthorne, California-based company. By 2016, Musk's private trust held 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.[73] SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon).[74] SpaceX designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft over a span of seven years. In September 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit.[36] SpaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for the highest thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket engine (the Merlin 1D).[75][76] SpaceX has produced more than 100 operational Merlin 1D engines. Each Merlin 1D engine can vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars. In combination, the 9 Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 first stage produce anywhere from 5.8 to 6.7\u00a0MN (1.3 to 1.5\u00a0million pounds) of thrust, depending on altitude.[77] In 2006, SpaceX was awarded a contract from NASA to continue the development and test of the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the International Space Station,[78][failed verification] followed by a US$1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services program contract on December 23, 2008, for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station, replacing the US Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011.[79] On May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.[80] Astronaut transport to the ISS is currently handled solely by the Soyuz, but SpaceX is one of two companies awarded a contract by NASA as part of the Commercial Crew Development program, which is currently projected to develop a US astronaut transport capability by 2020.[81] Musk believed the key to making space travel affordable was to make rockets reusable, though space industry experts believed reusable rockets were impossible or infeasible.[82] On December 22, 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad, the first time this had been achieved by an orbital rocket \u2014 a significant step to rocket reusability and lower cost access to space.[83] The first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform,[84] and by the end of 2017, SpaceX had landed and recovered the first stage on 16 consecutive missions where a landing and recovery were attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017. 20 out of 42 first stage Falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the Falcon 9 maiden flight in 2010.[85] In 2017 SpaceX launched 18 successful Falcon 9 flights, more than doubling their highest previous year of 8.[86] On February 6, 2018, SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built (after Saturn V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful rocket in operation as of 2018[update]. The inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to Musk as a dummy payload.[87] SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide global internet coverage, with an initial 60 satellites launched on 24 May 2019. Musk was influenced by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series[88] and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life.[89] Musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species. An asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years, atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball\u2014or go extinct.Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10.[90] In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10\u201320 years.[91] In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000.[37] Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains, Hyperloop, electric aircraft).[92] Musk stated in June 2016 that the first uncrewed flight of the larger Interplanetary Spaceship was aimed for departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed by the first crewed ITS Mars flight departing in 2024.[93] In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his architecture to explore and colonize Mars.[94] In late 2017, SpaceX unveiled the design for its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), that would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities with a single set of very large vehicles: Earth-orbit, Lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth, and totally replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon vehicles in the 2020s. Starship will have a 9-meter (30\u00a0ft) core diameter. Significant development on the vehicles began in 2017, with an initial prototype unveiled in September 2019,[95] while the new rocket engine (Raptor) development began in 2012,[96][97] with a first test flight performed in August 2019.[98] In a September 2018 announcement of a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called #dearMoon project,[99] Musk showed a redesigned concept for the BFR second stage and spaceship with three rear fins and two front canard fins added for atmospheric entry, replacing the previous delta wing and split flaps shown a year earlier. The revised BFR design was to use seven identically-sized Raptor engines in the second stage; the same engine model as would be used on the first stage. The second stage design had two small actuating canard fins near the nose of the ship, and three large fins at the base, two of which would actuate, with all three serving as landing legs.[100] Additionally, SpaceX also stated later that September that they were \"no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability.\"[101] The two major parts of the re-designed BFR were given descriptive names in November: \"Starship\" for the upper stage and \"Super Heavy\" for the booster stage, which Musk pointed out was \"needed to escape Earth's deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons).\"[102] Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[103] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[104] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.[105][106][15][107] All three, along with J. B. Straubel, were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero electric roadster prototype.[108] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[109] Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[82][110] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today. As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[14] Tesla's master plan, as iterated by Musk in 2006[111] was: \"Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options\". Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster, in 2008, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model\u00a0S sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012; however, the Model X launch was delayed until September 2015.[112][113][114] In addition to its own cars, Tesla sold electric powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors in Tesla.[115] Musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the NUMMI plant, now known as the Tesla Factory (Fremont, California) in 2010 Musk and Senator Dianne Feinstein next to a Tesla Model S (2010) Musk standing in front of a Tesla Model S in 2011 Musk favored building a more affordable Tesla model; this led to the Model 3 that was unveiled in 2016, with a planned base price of US$35,000.[111] Initial deliveries began in 2017, with the US$35,000 base model becoming available in February 2019.[116][117] Musk originally intended to name the model 3 as the model E but was blocked by Ford which held the trademark, with Musk concluding that \"Ford was killing SEX\".[118] Several mainstream publications have compared him with Henry Ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.[119] Musk has named the fastest acceleration modes of their vehicles after the Spaceballs' starship speeds (Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed).[120][121] In a May 2013 interview with All Things Digital, Musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars, Tesla planned to expand its network of supercharger stations, tripling the number on the East and West coasts of the U.S. that June, with plans for more expansion across North America, including Canada, throughout the year.[122] In 2014, Musk announced that Tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up the development of electric cars. \"The unfortunate reality is electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn't burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales,\" Musk said.[123] In February 2016, Musk announced that he had acquired the Tesla.com domain name from Stu Grossman, who had owned it since 1992, and changed Tesla's homepage to that domain.[124] Anticipating that the global lithium-ion battery supply was insufficient for their planned electric car output, a lithium-ion battery factory that would more than double existing global output was planned.[125] On July 29, 2016 the first phase of Gigafactory 1, a lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factory, was officially opened near Reno, Nevada, by Tesla in partnership with Panasonic.[126][127] Gigafactory 1 currently produces 35 GWh/yr of batteries. In July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"master plan part 2\"[128]: \"Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments [including small SUV and pickup truck]. Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning. Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it.\" In July 2016, Tesla commenced developing their autopilot hardware and software in-house, ending their previous partnership with Mobileye.[129] In November 2016, SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc.[130] In September 2017, Musk arranged a contract with the government of South Australia for Tesla Energy to install what would then be the world's largest lithium ion battery pack, to help alleviate energy blackouts in the state. Famously, Musk arranged this on twitter, with the guarantee that it would be installed in 100 days or would be free.[131] This deadline was achieved[132] and the resulting battery exceeded expected performance and returns,[133] despite skepticism from Australian federal politicians.[134][135] In September 2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. The lawsuit claimed that verbal discussions Musk held with foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key deal terms[136] and thus characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO on publicly traded companies.[137][138] Musk called the allegations unjustified and that he had never compromised his integrity.[139] Two days later, Musk reached a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down temporarily as Tesla chairman, while remaining Tesla's CEO.[140] Musk also proclaimed in several interviews since that he does not regret sending the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation. According to Reuters, Musk said the tweet was \"Worth It\".[141] According to ABC News, \"As recently as Oct. 4 2018, Musk issued a sarcastic tweet, describing the agency [SEC] as the 'Shortseller Enrichment Commission,' despite having agreed to settlement terms a week earlier that his company, Tesla, would monitor his tweets and other communications.\"[142] In a December 2018 interview with CBS's \u201c60 Minutes\u201d, Musk stated, \"I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC.\"[143] On February 19, 2019, according to Forbes, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.[144] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[145] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[146] In January 2019, Musk traveled to China for the groundbreaking of Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the company's first large-scale plant outside the U.S.[147] Part of his visit to China, Musk also met the Chinese premier Li Keqiang. During their exchange, Musk expressed his admiration for China and wished he could visit China more often, to which the Chinese premier was quoted as saying \"We can issue you a Chinese green card if that helps.\"[148][149] The time from the initial ground-breaking to production of first cars at the Shanghai Gigafactory was achieved in under one year.[150] In March 2019, the model Y small SUV was unveiled.[151] In November 2019, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Cybertruck, an all-electric battery powered pickup truck. The reveal was in Los Angeles\u2014the same month, year and location that the movie Blade Runner, which was a design inspiration, was set in.[152][153] To be manufactured in three variants of Single Motor RWD, Dual Motor AWD and Triple Motor AWD, Cybertruck is expected to start commercial production in late 2021.[154] As of January\u00a029, 2016[update], Musk owned about 28.9\u00a0million Tesla shares, which equates to about 22% of the company.[155][156] As of 2014[update], Musk's annual salary is one dollar, similar to that of Steve Jobs and other CEOs; the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performance-based bonuses.[157][158] In January 2018, Musk was granted an option to buy up to 20.3 million shares if Tesla's market value were to rise to $650 billion. Majority shareholder approval was approved in March 2018.[159] The grant was also meant to end speculation about Musk's potential departure from Tesla to devote more time to his other business ventures.[160] A report by advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. to its clients argued against granting the options.[citation needed][161] Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive.[162][163] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[164] SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc. in November 2016 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla.[130][165][166] The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global warming.[167][168] In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla would collaborate to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program going live in 2013.[169] On June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building a SolarCity advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Musk stated the plant will be \"one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world,\" and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent years.[170] The Tesla Gigafactory 2 is a photovoltaic (PV) cell factory, leased by Tesla subsidiary SolarCity in Buffalo, New York. Construction on the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017.[171] Tesla accepted $750 million in public funds from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as part of the Buffalo Billion project\u2014a plan to invest money to help the economy of the Buffalo, New York area\u2014to build the factory and infrastructure.[172] On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors.[173] The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.[174] After earlier envisioning Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX who worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system.[175][176] An early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[177][178][179] Musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce freestream flow. The document of alpha design estimated the total cost of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at US$6\u00a0billion, but this amount is speculative.[180] In June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015\u20132017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also started building a tunnel.[181] Hyperloop One, a company unaffiliated with Musk, had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its DevLoop track in Nevada on July 13, 2017. It was on May 12, 2017, at 12:02\u00a0a.m. and had lasted 5.3 seconds, reaching a top speed of 70\u00a0mph.[182] On July 20, 2017, Elon Musk announced that he had received verbal government approval to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[183] In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity.[184] By making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to \"counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry.\"[185] Musk has stated he wants to counteract the concentration of power.[33] In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[186] However, in an interview with Joe Rogan in September 2018, Musk warned about the dangers of developing artificial intelligence indiscriminately. In January 2019 Mark Harris of The Guardian noted that on 23 January the Musk foundation \"added a line to its website, stating its support for the \u201cdevelopment of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity\u201d\".[187] In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence. The company is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with computing devices.[188] Musk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: \"OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces.\"[33] On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted \"[I] am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging\u00a0...\" The company was named 'The Boring Company'.[189] On January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted \"Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.\"[190] The first tunnel will start on the SpaceX campus,[191] The Boring Test Tunnel runs underneath West 120th Street. As of January\u00a026, 2017[update], discussions with regulatory bodies had begun.[192] In February 2017, the company began digging a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) wide, 50-foot (15\u00a0m) long, and 15-foot (4.6\u00a0m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of Space X's offices in Los Angeles, since the construction requires no permits.[193][194] Musk had said in early 2017 that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring cost per mile is necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel network.[195] The tunnel width is optimized for electric vehicles only, which avoids complications of exhaust venting with internal combustion engines.[196] By late 2018, TBC had active construction, approved plans in place, or an operational tunnel in several areas of the United States: Baltimore,[197] Chicago[198] and Los Angeles. TBC provided an update on the state of their technology and product line when they opened to the public their first mile-long test tunnel in Hawthorne, California, on 18 December 2018, saying it has been a proof-of-concept for the technology.[199][200] TBC has claimed that design is complete for their next TBM, Prufrock, and that assembly and engineering testing would begin in 2019[199]:15:18\u201315:45 but there have been no announcements of such testing beginning by the end of 2019. As merchandising, the company sold 20,000 \"flamethrowers\" in 2018 [201][202], inspired by the movie Spaceballs.[203] After a string of negative press targeting Tesla caused Musk to become frustrated,[204] specifically articles published by Reveal News criticizing Tesla for its factory safety procedures,[205] Musk announced on Twitter that he is planning on creating a website where users could rate the truthfulness of specific articles in addition to the credibility of journalists and publications.[206] He suggested calling it \"Pravda\" after a Soviet Union-era Communist Party newspaper of the same name. This caused backlash from many journalists, claiming that a platform where any user could freely vote on an article's or a journalist's credibility could be prone to abuse.[207][208] After realizing the site \"pravda.com\" is used by the Ukrainian Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda, Musk bought the site pravduh.com on May 25, 2018.[209] In July 2018, Musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers during the Tham Luang cave rescue by arranging for his employees to build a small rescue pod. Musk, responding to requests for help from Twitter users,[210] contacted the Thai government.[211] He then arranged for engineers from two of his companies to design a child-sized submarine to help the rescue effort and documented the process via Twitter.[212][213] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, also urged Musk to continue construction of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[214] Engineers at Musk's companies SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine out of a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube[215] in 8 hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[216] Named \"Wild Boar\" after the children's soccer team,[217] its design, based on dive team feedback, was a five-foot (1.5\u00a0m)-long, twelve-inch (300\u00a0mm)-inch wide sealed tube weighing about 90 pounds (41\u00a0kg) propelled manually by divers in the front and back with segmented compartments to place diver weights to adjust buoyancy[216][218], intended to solve the problem of safely transporting the children who might have had difficulty learning the scuba skills required to exit the cave on their own without panicking. In case the mini-submarine could not fit through the cave system, Elon Musk also requested Wing Inflatables, a California-based inflatable boat manufacturer, to build inflatable escape pods. The pods were designed, fabricated, and tested in one day before being flown to Thailand.[219][220] By this time, eight of the twelve children had already been rescued (using full face masks and oxygen under anesthesia[221][222][223]) and Thai authorities decided not to use the submarine.[224][225][226] Elon Musk was later awarded a Member of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn by the King of Thailand in March 2019 for his and his team's contributions to the rescue mission.[227][228] The supervisor of the rescue operation Narongsak Osatanakorn stated that the submarine was \"technologically sophisticated, [but] it doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave\".[229][230] Vernon Unsworth, a recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the past six years and who had played a key advisory role in the rescue, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\"[231][232][233] and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as \"pedo guy\", causing backlash against Musk.[234][235] He subsequently deleted the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device, \"Stay tuned jackass.\"[235] On 16 July, Unsworth stated that he was considering legal action in relation to Musk's comments.[236][237] Two days later, Musk issued an apology for his remarks.[238][239][240][241] On 28 August 2018, in response to criticism from a writer on Twitter, Musk tweeted \"You don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me?\"[242] The following day, a letter from L.\u00a0Lin Wood, the rescuer's attorney, dated 6 August, emerged, showing that he had been making preparations for a libel lawsuit.[243][244] At some point, a self-proclaimed private investigator emailed Musk with an offer to \"dig deep\" into Unsworth's past, which Musk accepted in August 2018;[245] the investigator was later revealed to be a convicted felon with multiple counts of fraud.[246] On 30 August, using details produced during the alleged investigation,[247][248] Musk sent a BuzzFeed News reporter who had written about the controversy an email prefaced \"off the record\". It claimed that Unsworth is a \"single white guy from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years ... until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time\" (later stated by Unsworth's partner to be false). On 5 September, the reporter tweeted a screenshot of the email, saying that \"Off the record is a two-party agreement,\" which he \"did not agree to\".[249] In mid-September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles federal court.[250][251] In his defense, Musk has argued that in slang usage \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor.\" (The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang defines the term \"pedo\" as \"an unpleasant or unfortunate person ... adopted as an all-purpose insult....\")[252][253] The defamation case began on December 4, 2019, in Los Angeles, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.[254] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the initial tweet. On December 6 the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable; Musk commented: \"My faith in humanity is restored.\"[255] Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, stated: \"The truth vindicated Musk and Unsworth. Our system of justice worked\".[256] Musk first mentioned Teslaquila in an April Fools tweet in 2018.[257] The proposed Tesla-branded tequila appeared to become closer to reality in October 2018 as Tesla filed an \"intent to use\" trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[258] The trademark is for distilled agave liquor. Musk reaffirmed his intention to release the product with a tweet, featuring a mockup of the bottle, on October 12.[259] Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) has publicly denounced the proposed product, arguing, \"If it wants to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila producer, comply with certain standards and request authorization from Mexico's Industrial Property Institute.\"[260] On March 30, 2019, Musk released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud under the name \"Emo G Records\".[261] The track was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.[262][263] On January 30, 2020, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[264] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable ... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on Soundcloud\",[265] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[264] Politically, Musk has described himself as \"half Democrat, half Republican\" and \"I'm somewhere in the middle, socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"[266] In 2018, he stated that he was \"not a conservative. I'm registered independent [and] politically moderate.\"[267] Prompted by the emergence of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, Musk has voiced support for a universal basic income;[268] he additionally backs direct democracy.[269] He has described himself as a socialist, but \"not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm\" \u2013 arguing instead, \"true socialism seeks greatest good for all.\"[270] He supports targeting an inclusive tax rate of 40%, prefers consumption taxes to income taxes, and supports the estate tax, as the \"probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.\"[271] Musk has described the United States as \"[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth,\" describing it as \"the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been.\" Musk believes democracy would not exist any longer if not for the United States, saying that it prevented this disappearance on three occasions through its participation in World War I, World War II and the Cold War. Musk also stated that he thinks \"it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the United States has done.\"[272] Before the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Musk criticized candidate Trump by saying: \"I feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\"[273] Following Donald Trump's inauguration, Musk expressed approval of Trump's choice of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising President Trump. Regarding his cooperation with Trump, Musk has subsequently commented: \"The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better.\"[274] He subsequently resigned from both in June 2017, in protest at Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, stating: \"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world\".[275][276] In August 2019, Musk came out on Twitter in support of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, whose platform revolves around the ongoing problem of job displacement through technological automation and artificial intelligence. Musk said in a tweet that universal basic income, which Yang supports, is \"obviously needed.\"[277] In an interview with The Washington Post, Musk stated he was a \"significant (though not top-tier) donor to Democrats,\" but that he also gives heavily to Republicans. Musk further stated that political contributions are a requirement in order to have a voice in the United States government.[278][279] A 2012 report from the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending, found that since 2002, SpaceX had spent more US$4\u00a0million on lobbying the United States Congress and more than US$800,000 in political contributions to Democrats and Republicans. The same report said that \"SpaceX's campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated,\" and that \"unlike most tech-startups, SpaceX has maintained a significant lobbying presence in Washington almost since day\u00a01.\" and that \"Musk himself has donated roughly US$725,000 to various campaigns since 2002. In 2004, he contributed US$2,000 to President George W. Bush's reelection campaign, maxing out (over US$100,000)[280] to Barack Obama's reelection campaign and donated US$5,000 to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who represents Florida, a state critical to the space industry. (...) All told, Musk and SpaceX gave out roughly US$250,000 in the 2012 election cycle.\"[278][281] Additionally, SpaceX hired former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to represent the company, via the Washington-based lobbying group Patton Boggs LLP. Alongside Patton Boggs LLP, SpaceX uses several other outside lobbying firms, who work with SpaceX's own lobbyists.[282] Musk had been a supporter of the U.S. political action committee (PAC) FWD.us, which was started by fellow high-profile entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform. However, in May 2013, Musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the PAC was running that supported causes like the Keystone Pipeline. Musk and other members, including David O. Sacks, pulled out, criticizing the strategy as \"cynical.\"[283] Musk further stated, \"We shouldn't give in to the politics. If we give in to that, we'll get the political system we deserve.\"[284] In December 2013, Sean Becker of the media/political website Mic called Musk a \"complete hypocrite,\" stating that \"[for] the 2014 election cycle, Musk has contributed to the Longhorn PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2013 both of which have funded the campaigns of anti-science, anti-environment candidates such as Rep. Michelle Bachman (R-Minn.).\"[284] Musk has directly contributed to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change.[281] Musk has stated that he does not believe the U.S. government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage poor behavior. Musk says that the free market would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.[285] Musk's statements have been widely criticized, with Stanford University Professor Fred Turner noting that \"if you're an entrepreneur like Elon Musk, you will take the money where you can get it, but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that it's entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change, not the state. It is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received. And this goes on all the time in Silicon Valley.\"[286] Author Michael Shellenberger argued that \"in the case of Musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness. And I think there is a business reason for it. They are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent.\" Shellenberger continues, \"we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble.\" While journalist and author Jim Motavalli, who interviewed Musk for High Voltage, his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that \"Elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money \u2013 I do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them.\"[287] In 2015, Musk's statements were subject to further scrutiny when an LA Times article claimed that SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated US$4.9\u00a0billion in government subsidies over twenty years. One example given is New York state, which is spending $750\u00a0million to build a solar panel factory in Buffalo which will be leased to SolarCity for $1 a year. The deal also includes no property taxes for a decade, an estimated $260\u00a0million valuation. Musk employs a former U.S. State Department official as the chief negotiator for Tesla.[288] When asked whether he believed \"there was some kind of destiny involved\" in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than \"just physics\", Musk responded: Well, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably not because then you have to say: \"Where does the master intelligence come from?\" So it sort of begs the question. So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know it's complex phenomenon from simple elements.[289]Musk has stated that he does not pray, or worship any being, although he asked \"any entities that [were] listening\" to \"bless [the] launch\" before an important Falcon 1 launch. When asked whether he thought science and religion could co-exist, Musk replied \"Probably not.\"[290] Although Musk believes there could be simple life on other planets, he is unsure whether other intelligent life is likely.[290] Musk later said that he \"hope[s] that there is other intelligent life in the known universe\", and stated that it is \"probably more likely than not, but that's a complete guess.\"[291] Musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the Fermi paradox: The absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation ... Like when you're playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars in the background, but you can't ever get there. If it's not a simulation, then maybe we're in a lab and there's some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop, out of curiosity, like mould in a Petri dish ... If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilizations, and I mean strange in a bad way. ... And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilizations.[292]Musk has frequently spoken about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, calling it \"the most serious threat to the survival of the human race\". During a 2014 interview at the MIT AeroAstro Centennial Symposium, Musk described AI as humanity's largest existential threat, further stating, \"I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish.\" Musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as \"summoning the demon\".[293][294] Despite this, Musk invested in DeepMind, an AI firm, and Vicarious, a company working to improve machine intelligence.[295] In January 2015, he donated $10\u00a0million to the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies.[296] He was previously the co-chairman of OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.[297] Musk has said that his investments are \"not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return... I like to just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence. I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there. There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator. There are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.\"[295] In June 2016, Musk was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation, to which he answered: The strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation I think is the following: 40 years ago we had Pong \u2013 two rectangles and a dot. That's where we were. Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year. And soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable.[298]Musk's warnings about artificial intelligence have brought him some controversy. He and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg have clashed, with the latter calling his warnings \"pretty irresponsible\".[299] Musk responded to Zuckerberg's censure by saying that he had discussed AI with Zuckerberg and found him to have only a limited understanding of the subject. In 2014, Slate's Adam Elkus argued that current AIs were as intelligent as a toddler, and only in certain fields, going on to say that Musk's \"summoning the demon\" analogy may be harmful because it could result in significant cuts to AI research budgets.[300] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington D.C. think-tank, awarded its Annual Luddite Award to \"alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse\"; its president, Robert D. Atkinson, complained that Musk and others say AI is the largest existential threat to humanity. Atkinson stated \"That's not a very winning message if you want to get AI funding out of Congress to the National Science Foundation.\"[301][302][303] Nature sharply disagreed with the ITIF in an April 2016 editorial, siding instead with Musk, and concluding: \"It is crucial that progress in technology is matched by solid, well-funded research to anticipate the scenarios it could bring about ... If that is a Luddite perspective, then so be it.\"[304] In a 2015 Washington Post editorial, researcher Murray Shanahan stated that human-level AI is unlikely to arrive in the near future, but that nevertheless \"the time to start thinking through the consequences is now.\"[305] At a Tesla event on the sidelines of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems in December 2017, Musk stated that: I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where [sic] you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end? And it doesn't go all the time. ... It's a pain in the ass. That's why everyone doesn't like it. And there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.[306]Afterwards, he dismissed an audience member's response that public transportation functioned effectively in Japan.[307][308] His comment sparked widespread criticism from both the public and transit experts. Urban planning expert Brent Toderian started the hashtag #GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit which was widely adopted by Twitter users in order to dispel Musk's notion that everybody hated public transport.[307][309][310] Yonah Freemark, an urbanist and journalist specializing in planning and transportation, summarized Musk's views on public transport as \"It's terrible. You might be killed. Japanese trains are awful. Individualized transport for everyone! Congestion? Induced demand? Climate change impacts? Unwalkable streets? Who cares!\"[306] Jarrett Walker, a known public transport expert and consultant from Portland, said that \"Musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford\", referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferences\u00a0of a minority yields\u00a0an outcome that usually does not work for the majority.[311][312][313] Musk responded with \"You're an idiot\", later saying \"Sorry ... Meant to say 'sanctimonious idiot'.\"[314][315][316] The exchange received a significant amount of media attention and prompted Nobel laureate Paul Krugman to comment on the controversy, saying that \"You're an idiot\" is \"Elon Musk's idea of a cogent argument\".[311][317] Musk is chairman of the Musk Foundation, which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well as other goals.[318] In 2010, the Musk Foundation collaborated with SolarCity to donate a 25 kW solar power system to the South Bay Community Alliance's hurricane response center in Coden, Alabama.[319] In July 2011, the Musk Foundation donated US$250,000 towards a solar power project in S\u014dma, Japan, a city that had been recently devastated by a tsunami.[320] In July 2014, Musk was asked by cartoonist Matthew Inman and William Terbo, the grandnephew of Nikola Tesla, to donate US$8\u00a0million toward the construction of the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.[321] Ultimately, Musk agreed to donate US$1\u00a0million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a Tesla Supercharger in the museum car park.[322] Musk donated US$10\u00a0million to the Future of Life Institute in January 2015, to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity.[323][296][324] As of 2015[update], Musk is a trustee of the X Prize Foundation[325] and a signatory of The Giving Pledge.[326] In October 2018, in an effort to help solve the Flint water crisis, Musk and the Musk Foundation donated over $480,000 to install new water fountains with filtration systems for access to clean water at all Flint, Michigan schools.[327] As of 2019, approximately 30,000 children in all 12 area schools have safe drinking water freely available from the water filtration systems.[328] Musk has also been a top donor for the ACLU.[329] In October 2019, Musk donated US$1\u00a0million to '#TeamTrees' tree planting initiative led by the YouTube community[note 1] and in collaboration with Arbor Day Foundation.[330][331][332] Tosca Musk, Elon's sister, is a filmmaker. She is the founder of Musk Entertainment and has produced various movies.[333] Musk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while both were students at Ontario's Queen's University. They married in 2000 and separated in 2008.[334] Their first son, Nevada Alexander Musk, died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.[335] They later had five sons through in vitro fertilization[336] \u2013 twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006. They share custody of all five sons.[337] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley, and in 2010, the couple married. In January 2012, Musk announced that he had ended his four-year relationship with Riley,[27][338] tweeting to Riley, \"It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy one day.\"[339] In July 2013, Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, Musk filed for a second divorce from Riley; however, the action was withdrawn.[340] The media announced in March 2016 that divorce proceedings were again under way, this time with Riley filing for divorce from Musk.[341][342] The divorce was finalized in late 2016.[343] Musk began dating American actress Amber Heard in 2016 but the two split up after one year due to their conflicting schedules.[344][345] On May 7, 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they had begun dating.[346][347][348] On January 8, 2020, Grimes announced she was pregnant. The baby's father is assumed to be Musk, although this was not announced.[349][350] On 6 September 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. Within five days, the appearance had accrued 10 million YouTube views.[351] One of the highest profile and controversial aspects of the program was Musk's sampling a single puff from a cigar consisting, Rogan claimed, of tobacco laced with cannabis. To Rogan's inquiry on how often he smoked cannabis, Musk replied: \"Almost never. I know a lot of people like weed and that's fine, but I don't find that is very good for productivity... not for me.\" The Washington Post observed, \"In the media's hands, it became a story about Musk's growing instability\u00a0...\"[352] Tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the departure of Tesla's Vice President of Worldwide Finance earlier that day.[353] Fortune wondered if the cannabis use could have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States Air Force, though a USAF spokesperson told The Verge that there was no investigation being carried out and that the Air Force is still processing the situation.[354][355] In an interview on 60 Minutes, Musk said of the cannabis-smoking incident: \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[356] In Iron Man 2 (2010), Musk met Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in a restaurant, and had some brief lines regarding an \"idea for an electric jet.\"[381] In January 2015, Musk made a guest appearance playing himself on The Simpsons in an episode titled \"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\"; the episode poked fun at many of Musk's ideas.[382] In November 2015, Musk appeared in an episode of The Big Bang Theory, as himself volunteering at a soup kitchen with Wolowitz.[383] Musk also appeared as himself in a November 2017 of The Big Bang Theory spin-off prequel series Young Sheldon. The successful first landing of a SpaceX Falcon\u00a09 first stage on a drone ship is shown being covered by CNN. This is followed by a scene of Musk alone in his office with the notebook that young Sheldon mailed NASA in 1989 containing calculations detailing how this feat could be accomplished.[384] Musk was featured in the 2015 environmental documentary Racing Extinction, in which a custom Tesla Model S was designed to help project images of critically endangered species onto public buildings, including the Empire State Building and the Vatican.[385] Musk appeared in several episodes of South Park including the episode \"Members Only\", November 2016, which was voiced by himself. In 2016, Musk appeared as himself in the romantic comedy film Why Him? where he was briefly met by one of the main characters, Ned Flemming played by Bryan Cranston, in a bar at a party.[386] In December 2016, Robby in New Girl refers to saving a life, and when asked who, responds \"Do you know who Elon Musk is?\".[387] Also in 2016, Musk was referenced by Dr. Martin Stein on The CW time-travel TV show DC's Legends of Tomorrow. During time travel to the past, Stein meets his younger self and introduced himself as Elon Musk, to disguise his own identity.[388] In October 2017, Musk was mentioned as a historic pioneer on the CBS All Access series Star Trek: Discovery. Set in the year 2256, Captain Gabriel Lorca attempts to motivate a scientist on his ship by asking him \"How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright Brothers, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane? Or as a failed fungus expert. A selfish little man who put the survival of his own ego before the lives of others?\"[389][390] According to a TechCrunch article published the day after the episode aired, this mention is \"also interesting because of its notable omission of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos: This other space entrepreneur is such a big fan of Star Trek that he pitched and succeeded in landing a cameo in Star Trek Beyond as an alien being, but he doesn't rate a mention from Lorca among the spaceflight pantheon.\"[391] In February 2019, Musk co-hosted YouTuber PewDiePie's show \"Meme Review\" with Justin Roiland at the request of PewDiePie's fans.[392][393] In October of the same year, Musk voiced an alternate reality version of himself with tusks, known as \"Elon Tusk\", in the season four Rick and Morty episode \"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\".[394]",

He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a Bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue an entrepreneurial career. He subsequently co-founded Zip2 with his brother Kimbal, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.[6][15][16][17]\nIn May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded,[6] and became its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of SolarCity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain\u2013computer interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company focused on tunnels specialized for electric vehicles.\nApart from Tesla, Musk is not an investor in the stock market.[18] In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop, and has proposed a vertical take-off and landing supersonic jet electric aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet.[19] Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.[20] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on Mars.[21][22]\nMusk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,[23] the son of Maye Musk (n\u00e9e\u00a0Haldeman), a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[24] and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28] His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.[29][30] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[31][32] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[31] a choice made by Musk two years after his parents separated but which he subsequently regretted.[33] Musk is estranged from his father whom he has referred to as \"a terrible human being\".[33] He has a half-sister[34] and a half-brother.[35]\nDuring his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[36] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[37] He taught himself computer programming and, by the age of 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[38][39] A web version of the game is available online.[38][40]\nHis childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that \"you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one\".[33]\nMusk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost consciousness.[33] The damage to his nose required corrective surgery.[36][41]\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School[41] before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United States, saying \"I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible, more than any other country in the world.\"[42] Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th\u00a0birthday,[43] after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[44][45]\nElon Musk, [46]\nWhile awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[47] Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[48][49]\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage; and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.[50] His work at Rocket Science Games involved assembly programming of device drivers. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple\u2019s QuickTime who had hired Musk noted: \u201cHe had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.\u201d[51]\nIn 1995, Musk commenced a PhD in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California. Eager to pursue opportunities in the Internet boom, he dropped out after just two days to launch his first company, Zip2 Corporation.[52]\nIn 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of angel investors.[33]\nThe company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions and yellow pages.[53][54] The vector graphics mapping and direction code was implemented by Musk in Java.[55] Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune[56] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[57] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[36] Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307\u00a0million in cash[36]:109 and US$34\u00a0million in stock options[citation needed] in February 1999.[58] Musk received US$22\u00a0million for his 7 percent share from the sale.[56][36]:109\nIn March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10\u00a0million from the sale of Zip2.[43][53][57] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[56][59] which had a money-transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service.[60] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.[61] In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5\u00a0billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165\u00a0million.[62] Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.[63]\nIn July 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has sentimental value to him.[64]\nIn 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.[65][66] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[67] The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8\u00a0million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[67] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[68] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that, in theory, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed in software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.[69] Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.[70]\nWith US$100\u00a0million of his early fortune,[71] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002.[72] Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of the Hawthorne, California-based company. By 2016, Musk's private trust held 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.[73]\nSpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon).[74] SpaceX designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft over a span of seven years. In September 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit.[36]\nSpaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for the highest thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket engine (the Merlin 1D).[75][76] SpaceX has produced more than 100 operational Merlin 1D engines. Each Merlin 1D engine can vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars. In combination, the 9 Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 first stage produce anywhere from 5.8 to 6.7\u00a0MN (1.3 to 1.5\u00a0million pounds) of thrust, depending on altitude.[77]\nIn 2006, SpaceX was awarded a contract from NASA to continue the development and test of the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the International Space Station,[78][failed verification] followed by a US$1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services program contract on December 23, 2008, for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station, replacing the US Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011.[79]\nOn May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.[80]\nAstronaut transport to the ISS is currently handled solely by the Soyuz, but SpaceX is one of two companies awarded a contract by NASA as part of the Commercial Crew Development program, which is currently projected to develop a US astronaut transport capability by 2020.[81]\nMusk believed the key to making space travel affordable was to make rockets reusable, though space industry experts believed reusable rockets were impossible or infeasible.[82] On December 22, 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad, the first time this had been achieved by an orbital rocket \u2014 a significant step to rocket reusability and lower cost access to space.[83] The first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform,[84] and by the end of 2017, SpaceX had landed and recovered the first stage on 16 consecutive missions where a landing and recovery were attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017. 20 out of 42 first stage Falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the Falcon 9 maiden flight in 2010.[85]\nIn 2017 SpaceX launched 18 successful Falcon 9 flights, more than doubling their highest previous year of 8.[86]\nOn February 6, 2018, SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built (after Saturn V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful rocket in operation as of 2018[update]. The inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to Musk as a dummy payload.[87]\nSpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide global internet coverage, with an initial 60 satellites launched on 24 May 2019.\nMusk was influenced by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series[88] and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life.[89] Musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species.\nAn asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years, atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball\u2014or go extinct.Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10.[90] In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10\u201320 years.[91] In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000.[37] Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains, Hyperloop, electric aircraft).[92] Musk stated in June 2016 that the first uncrewed flight of the larger Interplanetary Spaceship was aimed for departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed by the first crewed ITS Mars flight departing in 2024.[93] In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his architecture to explore and colonize Mars.[94]\nIn late 2017, SpaceX unveiled the design for its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), that would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities with a single set of very large vehicles: Earth-orbit, Lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth, and totally replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon vehicles in the 2020s. Starship will have a 9-meter (30\u00a0ft) core diameter. Significant development on the vehicles began in 2017, with an initial prototype unveiled in September 2019,[95] while the new rocket engine (Raptor) development began in 2012,[96][97] with a first test flight performed in August 2019.[98]\nIn a September 2018 announcement of a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called #dearMoon project,[99] Musk showed a redesigned concept for the BFR second stage and spaceship with three rear fins and two front canard fins added for atmospheric entry, replacing the previous delta wing and split flaps shown a year earlier. The revised BFR design was to use seven identically-sized Raptor engines in the second stage; the same engine model as would be used on the first stage. The second stage design had two small actuating canard fins near the nose of the ship, and three large fins at the base, two of which would actuate, with all three serving as landing legs.[100] Additionally, SpaceX also stated later that September that they were \"no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability.\"[101] The two major parts of the re-designed BFR were given descriptive names in November: \"Starship\" for the upper stage and \"Super Heavy\" for the booster stage, which Musk pointed out was \"needed to escape Earth's deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons).\"[102]\nTesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[103]\nBoth men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[104] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.[105][106][15][107] All three, along with J. B. Straubel, were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero electric roadster prototype.[108] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[109] Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[82][110] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today. As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[14]\nTesla's master plan, as iterated by Musk in 2006[111] was: \"Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options\".\nTesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster, in 2008, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model\u00a0S sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012; however, the Model X launch was delayed until September 2015.[112][113][114] In addition to its own cars, Tesla sold electric powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors in Tesla.[115]\nMusk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the NUMMI plant, now known as the Tesla Factory (Fremont, California) in 2010\nMusk and Senator Dianne Feinstein next to a Tesla Model S (2010)\nMusk standing in front of a Tesla Model S in 2011\nMusk favored building a more affordable Tesla model; this led to the Model 3 that was unveiled in 2016, with a planned base price of US$35,000.[111] Initial deliveries began in 2017, with the US$35,000 base model becoming available in February 2019.[116][117] Musk originally intended to name the model 3 as the model E but was blocked by Ford which held the trademark, with Musk concluding that \"Ford was killing SEX\".[118]\nSeveral mainstream publications have compared him with Henry Ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.[119]\nMusk has named the fastest acceleration modes of their vehicles after the Spaceballs' starship speeds (Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed).[120][121]\nIn a May 2013 interview with All Things Digital, Musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars, Tesla planned to expand its network of supercharger stations, tripling the number on the East and West coasts of the U.S. that June, with plans for more expansion across North America, including Canada, throughout the year.[122]\nIn 2014, Musk announced that Tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up the development of electric cars. \"The unfortunate reality is electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn't burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales,\" Musk said.[123]\nIn February 2016, Musk announced that he had acquired the Tesla.com domain name from Stu Grossman, who had owned it since 1992, and changed Tesla's homepage to that domain.[124]\nAnticipating that the global lithium-ion battery supply was insufficient for their planned electric car output, a lithium-ion battery factory that would more than double existing global output was planned.[125] On July 29, 2016 the first phase of Gigafactory 1, a lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factory, was officially opened near Reno, Nevada, by Tesla in partnership with Panasonic.[126][127] Gigafactory 1 currently produces 35 GWh/yr of batteries.\nIn July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"master plan part 2\"[128]: \"Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments [including small SUV and pickup truck]. Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning. Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it.\"\nIn July 2016, Tesla commenced developing their autopilot hardware and software in-house, ending their previous partnership with Mobileye.[129]\nIn November 2016, SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc.[130]\nIn September 2017, Musk arranged a contract with the government of South Australia for Tesla Energy to install what would then be the world's largest lithium ion battery pack, to help alleviate energy blackouts in the state. Famously, Musk arranged this on twitter, with the guarantee that it would be installed in 100 days or would be free.[131] This deadline was achieved[132] and the resulting battery exceeded expected performance and returns,[133] despite skepticism from Australian federal politicians.[134][135]\nIn September 2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. The lawsuit claimed that verbal discussions Musk held with foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key deal terms[136] and thus characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO on publicly traded companies.[137][138] Musk called the allegations unjustified and that he had never compromised his integrity.[139] Two days later, Musk reached a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down temporarily as Tesla chairman, while remaining Tesla's CEO.[140] Musk also proclaimed in several interviews since that he does not regret sending the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation. According to Reuters, Musk said the tweet was \"Worth It\".[141] According to ABC News, \"As recently as Oct. 4 2018, Musk issued a sarcastic tweet, describing the agency [SEC] as the 'Shortseller Enrichment Commission,' despite having agreed to settlement terms a week earlier that his company, Tesla, would monitor his tweets and other communications.\"[142]\nIn a December 2018 interview with CBS's \u201c60 Minutes\u201d, Musk stated, \"I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC.\"[143]\nOn February 19, 2019, according to Forbes, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.[144]\nThe SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[145] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[146]\nIn January 2019, Musk traveled to China for the groundbreaking of Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the company's first large-scale plant outside the U.S.[147] Part of his visit to China, Musk also met the Chinese premier Li Keqiang. During their exchange, Musk expressed his admiration for China and wished he could visit China more often, to which the Chinese premier was quoted as saying \"We can issue you a Chinese green card if that helps.\"[148][149] The time from the initial ground-breaking to production of first cars at the Shanghai Gigafactory was achieved in under one year.[150]\nIn March 2019, the model Y small SUV was unveiled.[151]\nIn November 2019, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Cybertruck, an all-electric battery powered pickup truck. The reveal was in Los Angeles\u2014the same month, year and location that the movie Blade Runner, which was a design inspiration, was set in.[152][153] To be manufactured in three variants of Single Motor RWD, Dual Motor AWD and Triple Motor AWD, Cybertruck is expected to start commercial production in late 2021.[154]\nAs of January\u00a029, 2016[update], Musk owned about 28.9\u00a0million Tesla shares, which equates to about 22% of the company.[155][156]\nAs of 2014[update], Musk's annual salary is one dollar, similar to that of Steve Jobs and other CEOs; the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performance-based bonuses.[157][158] In January 2018, Musk was granted an option to buy up to 20.3 million shares if Tesla's market value were to rise to $650 billion. Majority shareholder approval was approved in March 2018.[159] The grant was also meant to end speculation about Musk's potential departure from Tesla to devote more time to his other business ventures.[160] A report by advisory firm Glass Lewis &amp; Co. to its clients argued against granting the options.[citation needed][161]\nMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive.[162][163] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[164] SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc. in November 2016 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla.[130][165][166]\nThe underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global warming.[167][168] In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla would collaborate to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program going live in 2013.[169]\nOn June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building a SolarCity advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Musk stated the plant will be \"one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world,\" and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent years.[170] The Tesla Gigafactory 2 is a photovoltaic (PV) cell factory, leased by Tesla subsidiary SolarCity in Buffalo, New York. Construction on the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017.[171] Tesla accepted $750 million in public funds from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as part of the Buffalo Billion project\u2014a plan to invest money to help the economy of the Buffalo, New York area\u2014to build the factory and infrastructure.[172]\nOn August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors.[173] The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.[174]\nAfter earlier envisioning Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX who worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system.[175][176] An early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[177][178][179] Musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce freestream flow. The document of alpha design estimated the total cost of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at US$6\u00a0billion, but this amount is speculative.[180]\nIn June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015\u20132017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also started building a tunnel.[181]\nHyperloop One, a company unaffiliated with Musk, had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its DevLoop track in Nevada on July 13, 2017. It was on May 12, 2017, at 12:02\u00a0a.m. and had lasted 5.3 seconds, reaching a top speed of 70\u00a0mph.[182]\nOn July 20, 2017, Elon Musk announced that he had received verbal government approval to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[183]\nIn December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity.[184]\nBy making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to \"counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry.\"[185] Musk has stated he wants to counteract the concentration of power.[33] In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[186]\nHowever, in an interview with Joe Rogan in September 2018, Musk warned about the dangers of developing artificial intelligence indiscriminately. In January 2019 Mark Harris of The Guardian noted that on 23 January the Musk foundation \"added a line to its website, stating its support for the \u201cdevelopment of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity\u201d\".[187]\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence. The company is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with computing devices.[188]\nMusk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: \"OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces.\"[33]\nOn December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted \"[I] am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging\u00a0...\" The company was named 'The Boring Company'.[189] On January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted \"Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.\"[190] The first tunnel will start on the SpaceX campus,[191] The Boring Test Tunnel runs underneath West 120th Street. As of January\u00a026, 2017[update], discussions with regulatory bodies had begun.[192]\nIn February 2017, the company began digging a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) wide, 50-foot (15\u00a0m) long, and 15-foot (4.6\u00a0m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of Space X's offices in Los Angeles, since the construction requires no permits.[193][194] Musk had said in early 2017 that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring cost per mile is necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel network.[195] The tunnel width is optimized for electric vehicles only, which avoids complications of exhaust venting with internal combustion engines.[196]\nBy late 2018, TBC had active construction, approved plans in place, or an operational tunnel in several areas of the United States: Baltimore,[197]\nChicago[198] and Los Angeles. TBC provided an update on the state of their technology and product line when they opened to the public their first mile-long test tunnel in Hawthorne, California, on 18 December 2018, saying it has been a proof-of-concept for the technology.[199][200]\nTBC has claimed that design is complete for their next TBM, Prufrock, and that assembly and engineering testing would begin in 2019[199]:15:18\u201315:45 but there have been no announcements of such testing beginning by the end of 2019.\nAs merchandising, the company sold 20,000 \"flamethrowers\" in 2018 [201][202], inspired by the movie Spaceballs.[203]\nAfter a string of negative press targeting Tesla caused Musk to become frustrated,[204] specifically articles published by Reveal News criticizing Tesla for its factory safety procedures,[205] Musk announced on Twitter that he is planning on creating a website where users could rate the truthfulness of specific articles in addition to the credibility of journalists and publications.[206] He suggested calling it \"Pravda\" after a Soviet Union-era Communist Party newspaper of the same name.\nThis caused backlash from many journalists, claiming that a platform where any user could freely vote on an article's or a journalist's credibility could be prone to abuse.[207][208]\nAfter realizing the site \"pravda.com\" is used by the Ukrainian Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda, Musk bought the site pravduh.com on May 25, 2018.[209]\nIn July 2018, Musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers during the Tham Luang cave rescue by arranging for his employees to build a small rescue pod.\nMusk, responding to requests for help from Twitter users,[210] contacted the Thai government.[211] He then arranged for engineers from two of his companies to design a child-sized submarine to help the rescue effort and documented the process via Twitter.[212][213] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, also urged Musk to continue construction of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[214] Engineers at Musk's companies SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine out of a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube[215] in 8 hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[216]\nNamed \"Wild Boar\" after the children's soccer team,[217] its design, based on dive team feedback, was a five-foot (1.5\u00a0m)-long, twelve-inch (300\u00a0mm)-inch wide sealed tube weighing about 90 pounds (41\u00a0kg) propelled manually by divers in the front and back with segmented compartments to place diver weights to adjust buoyancy[216][218], intended to solve the problem of safely transporting the children who might have had difficulty learning the scuba skills required to exit the cave on their own without panicking. In case the mini-submarine could not fit through the cave system, Elon Musk also requested Wing Inflatables, a California-based inflatable boat manufacturer, to build inflatable escape pods. The pods were designed, fabricated, and tested in one day before being flown to Thailand.[219][220]\nBy this time, eight of the twelve children had already been rescued (using full face masks and oxygen under anesthesia[221][222][223]) and Thai authorities decided not to use the submarine.[224][225][226]\nElon Musk was later awarded a Member of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn by the King of Thailand in March 2019 for his and his team's contributions to the rescue mission.[227][228]\nThe supervisor of the rescue operation Narongsak Osatanakorn stated that the submarine was \"technologically sophisticated, [but] it doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave\".[229][230] Vernon Unsworth, a recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the past six years and who had played a key advisory role in the rescue, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\"[231][232][233] and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as \"pedo guy\", causing backlash against Musk.[234][235] He subsequently deleted the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device, \"Stay tuned jackass.\"[235] On 16 July, Unsworth stated that he was considering legal action in relation to Musk's comments.[236][237]\nTwo days later, Musk issued an apology for his remarks.[238][239][240][241]\nOn 28 August 2018, in response to criticism from a writer on Twitter, Musk tweeted \"You don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me?\"[242] The following day, a letter from L.\u00a0Lin Wood, the rescuer's attorney, dated 6 August, emerged, showing that he had been making preparations for a libel lawsuit.[243][244]\nAt some point, a self-proclaimed private investigator emailed Musk with an offer to \"dig deep\" into Unsworth's past, which Musk accepted in August 2018;[245] the investigator was later revealed to be a convicted felon with multiple counts of fraud.[246] On 30 August, using details produced during the alleged investigation,[247][248] Musk sent a BuzzFeed News reporter who had written about the controversy an email prefaced \"off the record\". It claimed that Unsworth is a \"single white guy from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years ... until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time\" (later stated by Unsworth's partner to be false). On 5 September, the reporter tweeted a screenshot of the email, saying that \"Off the record is a two-party agreement,\" which he \"did not agree to\".[249]\nIn mid-September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles federal court.[250][251] In his defense, Musk has argued that in slang usage \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor.\" (The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang defines the term \"pedo\" as \"an unpleasant or unfortunate person ... adopted as an all-purpose insult....\")[252][253]\nThe defamation case began on December 4, 2019, in Los Angeles, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.[254] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the initial tweet. On December 6 the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable; Musk commented: \"My faith in humanity is restored.\"[255] Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, stated: \"The truth vindicated Musk and Unsworth. Our system of justice worked\".[256]\nMusk first mentioned Teslaquila in an April Fools tweet in 2018.[257] The proposed Tesla-branded tequila appeared to become closer to reality in October 2018 as Tesla filed an \"intent to use\" trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[258] The trademark is for distilled agave liquor. Musk reaffirmed his intention to release the product with a tweet, featuring a mockup of the bottle, on October 12.[259]\nMexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) has publicly denounced the proposed product, arguing, \"If it wants to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila producer, comply with certain standards and request authorization from Mexico's Industrial Property Institute.\"[260]\nOn March 30, 2019, Musk released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud under the name \"Emo G Records\".[261] The track was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.[262][263] On January 30, 2020, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[264] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable ... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on Soundcloud\",[265] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[264]\nPolitically, Musk has described himself as \"half Democrat, half Republican\" and \"I'm somewhere in the middle, socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"[266] In 2018, he stated that he was \"not a conservative. I'm registered independent [and] politically moderate.\"[267] Prompted by the emergence of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, Musk has voiced support for a universal basic income;[268] he additionally backs direct democracy.[269] He has described himself as a socialist, but \"not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm\" \u2013 arguing instead, \"true socialism seeks greatest good for all.\"[270] He supports targeting an inclusive tax rate of 40%, prefers consumption taxes to income taxes, and supports the estate tax, as the \"probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.\"[271]\nMusk has described the United States as \"[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth,\" describing it as \"the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been.\" Musk believes democracy would not exist any longer if not for the United States, saying that it prevented this disappearance on three occasions through its participation in World War I, World War II and the Cold War. Musk also stated that he thinks \"it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the United States has done.\"[272]\nBefore the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Musk criticized candidate Trump by saying: \"I feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\"[273] Following Donald Trump's inauguration, Musk expressed approval of Trump's choice of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising President Trump. Regarding his cooperation with Trump, Musk has subsequently commented: \"The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better.\"[274] He subsequently resigned from both in June 2017, in protest at Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, stating: \"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world\".[275][276]\nIn August 2019, Musk came out on Twitter in support of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, whose platform revolves around the ongoing problem of job displacement through technological automation and artificial intelligence. Musk said in a tweet that universal basic income, which Yang supports, is \"obviously needed.\"[277]\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Musk stated he was a \"significant (though not top-tier) donor to Democrats,\" but that he also gives heavily to Republicans. Musk further stated that political contributions are a requirement in order to have a voice in the United States government.[278][279]\nA 2012 report from the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending, found that since 2002, SpaceX had spent more US$4\u00a0million on lobbying the United States Congress and more than US$800,000 in political contributions to Democrats and Republicans. The same report said that \"SpaceX's campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated,\" and that \"unlike most tech-startups, SpaceX has maintained a significant lobbying presence in Washington almost since day\u00a01.\" and that \"Musk himself has donated roughly US$725,000 to various campaigns since 2002. In 2004, he contributed US$2,000 to President George W. Bush's reelection campaign, maxing out (over US$100,000)[280] to Barack Obama's reelection campaign and donated US$5,000 to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who represents Florida, a state critical to the space industry. (...) All told, Musk and SpaceX gave out roughly US$250,000 in the 2012 election cycle.\"[278][281] Additionally, SpaceX hired former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to represent the company, via the Washington-based lobbying group Patton Boggs LLP. Alongside Patton Boggs LLP, SpaceX uses several other outside lobbying firms, who work with SpaceX's own lobbyists.[282]\nMusk had been a supporter of the U.S. political action committee (PAC) FWD.us, which was started by fellow high-profile entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform. However, in May 2013, Musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the PAC was running that supported causes like the Keystone Pipeline. Musk and other members, including David O. Sacks, pulled out, criticizing the strategy as \"cynical.\"[283] Musk further stated, \"We shouldn't give in to the politics. If we give in to that, we'll get the political system we deserve.\"[284]\nIn December 2013, Sean Becker of the media/political website Mic called Musk a \"complete hypocrite,\" stating that \"[for] the 2014 election cycle, Musk has contributed to the Longhorn PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2013 both of which have funded the campaigns of anti-science, anti-environment candidates such as Rep. Michelle Bachman (R-Minn.).\"[284] Musk has directly contributed to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change.[281]\nMusk has stated that he does not believe the U.S. government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage poor behavior. Musk says that the free market would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.[285]\nMusk's statements have been widely criticized, with Stanford University Professor Fred Turner noting that \"if you're an entrepreneur like Elon Musk, you will take the money where you can get it, but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that it's entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change, not the state. It is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received. And this goes on all the time in Silicon Valley.\"[286] Author Michael Shellenberger argued that \"in the case of Musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness. And I think there is a business reason for it. They are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent.\" Shellenberger continues, \"we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble.\" While journalist and author Jim Motavalli, who interviewed Musk for High Voltage, his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that \"Elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money \u2013 I do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them.\"[287]\nIn 2015, Musk's statements were subject to further scrutiny when an LA Times article claimed that SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated US$4.9\u00a0billion in government subsidies over twenty years. One example given is New York state, which is spending $750\u00a0million to build a solar panel factory in Buffalo which will be leased to SolarCity for $1 a year. The deal also includes no property taxes for a decade, an estimated $260\u00a0million valuation. Musk employs a former U.S. State Department official as the chief negotiator for Tesla.[288]\nWhen asked whether he believed \"there was some kind of destiny involved\" in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than \"just physics\", Musk responded:\nWell, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably not because then you have to say: \"Where does the master intelligence come from?\" So it sort of begs the question. So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know it's complex phenomenon from simple elements.[289]Musk has stated that he does not pray, or worship any being, although he asked \"any entities that [were] listening\" to \"bless [the] launch\" before an important Falcon 1 launch. When asked whether he thought science and religion could co-exist, Musk replied \"Probably not.\"[290]\nAlthough Musk believes there could be simple life on other planets, he is unsure whether other intelligent life is likely.[290] Musk later said that he \"hope[s] that there is other intelligent life in the known universe\", and stated that it is \"probably more likely than not, but that's a complete guess.\"[291]\nMusk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the Fermi paradox:\nThe absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation ... Like when you're playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars in the background, but you can't ever get there. If it's not a simulation, then maybe we're in a lab and there's some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop, out of curiosity, like mould in a Petri dish ... If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilizations, and I mean strange in a bad way. ... And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilizations.[292]Musk has frequently spoken about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, calling it \"the most serious threat to the survival of the human race\". During a 2014 interview at the MIT AeroAstro Centennial Symposium, Musk described AI as humanity's largest existential threat, further stating, \"I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish.\" Musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as \"summoning the demon\".[293][294]\nDespite this, Musk invested in DeepMind, an AI firm, and Vicarious, a company working to improve machine intelligence.[295] In January 2015, he donated $10\u00a0million to the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies.[296] He was previously the co-chairman of OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.[297]\nMusk has said that his investments are \"not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return... I like to just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence. I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there. There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator. There are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.\"[295]\nIn June 2016, Musk was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation, to which he answered:\nThe strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation I think is the following: 40 years ago we had Pong \u2013 two rectangles and a dot. That's where we were. Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year. And soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable.[298]Musk's warnings about artificial intelligence have brought him some controversy. He and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg have clashed, with the latter calling his warnings \"pretty irresponsible\".[299] Musk responded to Zuckerberg's censure by saying that he had discussed AI with Zuckerberg and found him to have only a limited understanding of the subject. In 2014, Slate's Adam Elkus argued that current AIs were as intelligent as a toddler, and only in certain fields, going on to say that Musk's \"summoning the demon\" analogy may be harmful because it could result in significant cuts to AI research budgets.[300]\nThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington D.C. think-tank, awarded its Annual Luddite Award to \"alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse\"; its president, Robert D. Atkinson, complained that Musk and others say AI is the largest existential threat to humanity. Atkinson stated \"That's not a very winning message if you want to get AI funding out of Congress to the National Science Foundation.\"[301][302][303] Nature sharply disagreed with the ITIF in an April 2016 editorial, siding instead with Musk, and concluding: \"It is crucial that progress in technology is matched by solid, well-funded research to anticipate the scenarios it could bring about ... If that is a Luddite perspective, then so be it.\"[304] In a 2015 Washington Post editorial, researcher Murray Shanahan stated that human-level AI is unlikely to arrive in the near future, but that nevertheless \"the time to start thinking through the consequences is now.\"[305]\nAt a Tesla event on the sidelines of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems in December 2017, Musk stated that:\nI think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where [sic] you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end? And it doesn't go all the time. ... It's a pain in the ass. That's why everyone doesn't like it. And there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.[306]Afterwards, he dismissed an audience member's response that public transportation functioned effectively in Japan.[307][308]\nHis comment sparked widespread criticism from both the public and transit experts. Urban planning expert Brent Toderian started the hashtag #GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit which was widely adopted by Twitter users in order to dispel Musk's notion that everybody hated public transport.[307][309][310] Yonah Freemark, an urbanist and journalist specializing in planning and transportation, summarized Musk's views on public transport as \"It's terrible. You might be killed. Japanese trains are awful. Individualized transport for everyone! Congestion? Induced demand? Climate change impacts? Unwalkable streets? Who cares!\"[306]\nJarrett Walker, a known public transport expert and consultant from Portland, said that \"Musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford\", referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferences\u00a0of a minority yields\u00a0an outcome that usually does not work for the majority.[311][312][313] Musk responded with \"You're an idiot\", later saying \"Sorry ... Meant to say 'sanctimonious idiot'.\"[314][315][316] The exchange received a significant amount of media attention and prompted Nobel laureate Paul Krugman to comment on the controversy, saying that \"You're an idiot\" is \"Elon Musk's idea of a cogent argument\".[311][317]\nMusk is chairman of the Musk Foundation, which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well as other goals.[318] In 2010, the Musk Foundation collaborated with SolarCity to donate a 25 kW solar power system to the South Bay Community Alliance's hurricane response center in Coden, Alabama.[319] In July 2011, the Musk Foundation donated US$250,000 towards a solar power project in S\u014dma, Japan, a city that had been recently devastated by a tsunami.[320]\nIn July 2014, Musk was asked by cartoonist Matthew Inman and William Terbo, the grandnephew of Nikola Tesla, to donate US$8\u00a0million toward the construction of the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.[321] Ultimately, Musk agreed to donate US$1\u00a0million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a Tesla Supercharger in the museum car park.[322]\nMusk donated US$10\u00a0million to the Future of Life Institute in January 2015, to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity.[323][296][324]\nAs of 2015[update], Musk is a trustee of the X Prize Foundation[325] and a signatory of The Giving Pledge.[326]\nIn October 2018, in an effort to help solve the Flint water crisis, Musk and the Musk Foundation donated over $480,000 to install new water fountains with filtration systems for access to clean water at all Flint, Michigan schools.[327] As of 2019, approximately 30,000 children in all 12 area schools have safe drinking water freely available from the water filtration systems.[328]\nMusk has also been a top donor for the ACLU.[329]\nIn October 2019, Musk donated US$1\u00a0million to '#TeamTrees' tree planting initiative led by the YouTube community[note 1] and in collaboration with Arbor Day Foundation.[330][331][332]\nTosca Musk, Elon's sister, is a filmmaker. She is the founder of Musk Entertainment and has produced various movies.[333]\nMusk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while both were students at Ontario's Queen's University. They married in 2000 and separated in 2008.[334] Their first son, Nevada Alexander Musk, died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.[335] They later had five sons through in vitro fertilization[336] \u2013 twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006. They share custody of all five sons.[337]\nIn 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley, and in 2010, the couple married. In January 2012, Musk announced that he had ended his four-year relationship with Riley,[27][338] tweeting to Riley, \"It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy one day.\"[339] In July 2013, Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, Musk filed for a second divorce from Riley; however, the action was withdrawn.[340] The media announced in March 2016 that divorce proceedings were again under way, this time with Riley filing for divorce from Musk.[341][342] The divorce was finalized in late 2016.[343]\nMusk began dating American actress Amber Heard in 2016 but the two split up after one year due to their conflicting schedules.[344][345]\nOn May 7, 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they had begun dating.[346][347][348] On January 8, 2020, Grimes announced she was pregnant. The baby's father is assumed to be Musk, although this was not announced.[349][350]\nOn 6 September 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. Within five days, the appearance had accrued 10 million YouTube views.[351] One of the highest profile and controversial aspects of the program was Musk's sampling a single puff from a cigar consisting, Rogan claimed, of tobacco laced with cannabis. To Rogan's inquiry on how often he smoked cannabis, Musk replied: \"Almost never. I know a lot of people like weed and that's fine, but I don't find that is very good for productivity... not for me.\" The Washington Post observed, \"In the media's hands, it became a story about Musk's growing instability\u00a0...\"[352] Tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the departure of Tesla's Vice President of Worldwide Finance earlier that day.[353] Fortune wondered if the cannabis use could have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States Air Force, though a USAF spokesperson told The Verge that there was no investigation being carried out and that the Air Force is still processing the situation.[354][355]\nIn an interview on 60 Minutes, Musk said of the cannabis-smoking incident: \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[356]\nIn Iron Man 2 (2010), Musk met Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in a restaurant, and had some brief lines regarding an \"idea for an electric jet.\"[381]\nIn January 2015, Musk made a guest appearance playing himself on The Simpsons in an episode titled \"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\"; the episode poked fun at many of Musk's ideas.[382]\nIn November 2015, Musk appeared in an episode of The Big Bang Theory, as himself volunteering at a soup kitchen with Wolowitz.[383]\nMusk also appeared as himself in a November 2017 of The Big Bang Theory spin-off prequel series Young Sheldon. The successful first landing of a SpaceX Falcon\u00a09 first stage on a drone ship is shown being covered by CNN. This is followed by a scene of Musk alone in his office with the notebook that young Sheldon mailed NASA in 1989 containing calculations detailing how this feat could be accomplished.[384]\nMusk was featured in the 2015 environmental documentary Racing Extinction, in which a custom Tesla Model S was designed to help project images of critically endangered species onto public buildings, including the Empire State Building and the Vatican.[385]\nMusk appeared in several episodes of South Park including the episode \"Members Only\", November 2016, which was voiced by himself.\nIn 2016, Musk appeared as himself in the romantic comedy film Why Him? where he was briefly met by one of the main characters, Ned Flemming played by Bryan Cranston, in a bar at a party.[386] In December 2016, Robby in New Girl refers to saving a life, and when asked who, responds \"Do you know who Elon Musk is?\".[387] Also in 2016, Musk was referenced by Dr. Martin Stein on The CW time-travel TV show DC's Legends of Tomorrow. During time travel to the past, Stein meets his younger self and introduced himself as Elon Musk, to disguise his own identity.[388]\nIn October 2017, Musk was mentioned as a historic pioneer on the CBS All Access series Star Trek: Discovery. Set in the year 2256, Captain Gabriel Lorca attempts to motivate a scientist on his ship by asking him \"How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright Brothers, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane? Or as a failed fungus expert. A selfish little man who put the survival of his own ego before the lives of others?\"[389][390] According to a TechCrunch article published the day after the episode aired, this mention is \"also interesting because of its notable omission of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos: This other space entrepreneur is such a big fan of Star Trek that he pitched and succeeded in landing a cameo in Star Trek Beyond as an alien being, but he doesn't rate a mention from Lorca among the spaceflight pantheon.\"[391]\nIn February 2019, Musk co-hosted YouTuber PewDiePie's show \"Meme Review\" with Justin Roiland at the request of PewDiePie's fans.[392][393] In October of the same year, Musk voiced an alternate reality version of himself with tusks, known as \"Elon Tusk\", in the season four Rick and Morty episode \"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\".[394]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJames Francis Cameron[1] CC (born August 16, 1954) is a Canadian filmmaker, artist, and environmentalist, who is best known for making science fiction and epic films for the Hollywood mainstream. Cameron first gained recognition for directing The Terminator (1984). He found further critical and commercial success with Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and True Lies (1994). His greatest big-budget productions have been Titanic (1997) and Avatar (2009), the former earning him Academy Awards in Best Picture, Best Director and Best Film Editing. Avatar, filmed in 3D technology, also garnered him nominations in the same categories. He also co-founded Lightstorm Entertainment, Digital Domain and Earthship Productions. In addition to his filmmaking, he is a National Geographic explorer of the sea and has produced a number of documentaries on the subject. Cameron contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technologies and helped create the digital 3D Fusion Camera System.[2][3][4] In 2012, Cameron became the first person to perform a solo descent to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Earth's ocean, in the Deepsea Challenger submersible.[5][6] In total, Cameron's films have grossed approximately US$2\u00a0billion in North America and US$6\u00a0billion worldwide. Cameron's Avatar and Titanic are the second and third highest-grossing films of all time, earning $2.78\u00a0billion and $2.19\u00a0billion, respectively. Cameron holds the achievement of having directed the first two of the five films in history to gross over $2 billion worldwide.[7] In 2010, Time magazine named Cameron one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[8] Cameron was born in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, to Philip Cameron, an electrical engineer, and Shirley (n\u00e9e Lowe), an artist and nurse.[9] His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825.[9] Cameron is the eldest of five siblings[10] and as a child he described the Lord's Prayer as a \"tribal chant\".[11] He attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls. At age 17, Cameron and his family moved from Chippawa, Ontario to Brea, California.[12] He attended Sonora High School and then moved to Brea Olinda High School. Classmates recalled that he was not a sportsman but instead enjoyed building things that \"either went up into the air or into the deep\".[10] After high school, Cameron enrolled at Fullerton College, a community college in 1973 to study physics. He switched subjects to English, but left the college at the end of 1974.[13] He worked odd jobs, including as a truck driver and janitor, but writing in his free time.[14] During this period, he learnt about special effects by reading other students' work on \"optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology\" at the library.[15] After excitement of seeing Star Wars in 1977, Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry.[16] Cameron's directing career began in 1978. After borrowing money from a consortium of dentists, he learnt to direct, write and produce his first short film, Xenogenesis (1978) with a friend.[17] Learning as they went, he has said that he felt like a doctor doing his first surgical procedure.[15] He then served as a production assistant for Rock and Roll High School (1979). While educating himself about film-making techniques, Cameron started a job as a miniature model maker at Roger Corman Studios.[14][18] He was soon employed as an art director in the science-fiction film Battle Beyond the Stars (1980). He carried out the special effects for John Carpenter's Escape from New York (1981), served as production designer for Galaxy of Terror (1981), and consulted on the design for Android (1982). Cameron was hired as the special effects director for the sequel to Piranha (1978), titled Piranha II: The Spawning in 1982. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with producer Ovidio Assonitis. Shot in Rome, Italy and on Grand Cayman Island, the film gave Cameron the opportunity to become director for a major film for the first time. However, Cameron later said that it did not feel like his first movie due to power-struggles with Assonitis.[19] Disillusioned from being in Rome and suffering from a fever, Cameron had a nightmare about an invincible robot hit-man sent from the future to assassinate him, which later led to the inspiration of The Terminator (1984).[20] Upon release of Piranha II: The Spawning, critics were not impressed. Tim Healey, in his book, called it \"a marvellously bad movie which splices cliches from every conceivable source.\"[21] Inspired by John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and other science fiction work, Cameron wrote the script for The Terminator (1984) in 1982, which is a thriller about cyborg sent from the future to carry out a lethal mission. Cameron wanted to sell the script so that he could direct the movie. Whilst some film studios expressed interested in the project, many executives were unwilling to let a new and unfamiliar director make the movie. Gale Anne Hurd, a colleague and founder of Pacific Western Productions, to whom Cameron was married from 1984 to 1989, agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Eventually, he convinced the president of Hemdale Pictures to make the film, with Cameron as director and Hurd as a producer. Lance Henriksen, who had starred in Piranha II: The Spawning, was considered for the lead role, but Cameron decided that Arnold Schwarzenegger was more suitable as the cyborg villain due to his bodybuilder appearance. Henriksen was given a smaller role instead. Michael Biehn and Cameron's future wife, Linda Hamilton, also joined the cast. The Terminator was a box office success, exceeding expectations set by Orion Pictures, who thought that the film would be short-lived in theaters.[11] The movie proved popular with audiences and earned over $78\u00a0million worldwide, from a budget of $6.5\u00a0million.[22] In 2008, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[23] In 1984, Cameron co-wrote the screenplay to Rambo: First Blood Part II with Sylvester Stallone.[24] Soon, Cameron moved onto his next directorial feature, which was the sequel to Alien (1979), a science fiction horror by Ridley Scott. After titling the sequel Aliens (1986), Cameron recast Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, who first appeared in Alien. Aliens follows the protagonist, Ripley, as she helps a group of marines fight off extraterrestrials. Despite conflicts with cast and crew during production, and having to replace one of the lead actors\u2014James Remar with Michael Biehn\u2014Aliens was a box office success, generating over $130 million worldwide.[25] The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1987; Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score and Best Sound. It won awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. In addition, the film including Weaver made the cover of TIME magazine in July 1986.[26]After Aliens, Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd decided to make The Abyss, a story of oil-rig workers who discover strange intelligent life in the ocean. Based on an idea which Cameron had conceived of during high school, the film was initially budgeted at $41\u00a0million, although it ran considerably over this amount. It starred Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The production process began in the Cayman Islands and then at South Carolina, inside the building of an unfinished nuclear power plant with two huge tanks.[27] The cast and crew recall Cameron's tough demands and filming the underwater scenes which were physically exhausting for everyone.[28] Upon the film's release, The Abyss was praised for its special effects, and earned $90 million at the worldwide box office.[29] The Abyss received four Academy Award nominations and won Best Visual Effects. In 1990, Cameron co-founded the firm Lightstorm Entertainment with partner Lawrence Kasanoff. In 1991, Cameron served as executive producer for Point Break (1991), directed by former wife Kathryn Bigelow. After the success of The Terminator, there were discussions for a sequel. In the late 1980s, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to begin production of the film, titled Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Written by Cameron and William Wisher Jr., lead actors Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprised their earlier roles. The story follows on from the first Terminator film, depicting a new villain (T-1000), possessing shape-shifting ability and hunts for Sarah Connor's son. Cameron cast Robert Patrick as T-1000 because of his lean and thin appearance\u2014a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained, \"I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human Panzer tank, then the T-1000 is a Porsche.\"[30] Like its predecessor, Terminator 2 was one of the most expensive films to be produced, costing at least $94 million.[31] Despite the challenging use of computer-generated imagery, the film was completed on time and released on July 3, 1991. Terminator 2: Judgment Day broke box office records (including the opening weekend record for an R-rated film), earning over $200\u00a0million in the North America and being the first to earn over $300\u00a0million worldwide.[32] It won four Academy Awards: Best Makeup, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It also received nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, but lost both to political thriller JFK. In subsequent years, Cameron planned to do a third Terminator film but plans never materialized. The rights to the Terminator franchise were eventually purchased by Kassar from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco's assets.[33] He moved onto other projects and in 1993, Cameron co-founded Digital Domain, a visual effects production company. In 1994, Cameron and Schwarzenegger reunited for their third collaboration, titled True Lies (1994), a remake of the 1991 French comedy La Totale! The story depicts an American secret agent who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. The film co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Eliza Dushku and Tom Arnold. Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment signed a deal with 20th Century Fox for the production of True Lies. Budgeted at a minimum of $100\u00a0million, the film earned $146\u00a0million in North America, and $232\u00a0million worldwide.[34][35] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Curtis won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. In 1995, Cameron co-produced Strange Days (1995), a science fiction thriller. The film was directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by Jay Cocks.[36] Strange Days was critically and financially unsuccessful. In 1996, Cameron reunited with the cast of Terminator 2 to film T2 3-D: Battle Across Time, an attraction at Universal Studios Florida[37] and at other parks around the world. His next major project was Titanic (1997), an epic film about RMS\u00a0Titanic which sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg. With a production budget of $200\u00a0million, Titanic is one of the most expensive films ever made. The production was troubled for being over-budget and exceeding its filming schedule, which made headlines before the film's release.[38][39] Starting in 1995, Cameron took several dives to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to capture footage of the wreck, which would later be used in the film.[40] A replica of the ship was built in Rosarito Beach and principal photography began in September 1996. His completed screenplay depicts two star-crossed lovers, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, from different social classes who fall in love amid the backdrop of the tragedy\u2014a sharp turn from Cameron's previous films. The supporting cast included Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, David Warner and Bill Paxton.After months of delay, Titanic premiered on December 19, 1997. Titanic received strong critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, and held this position for twelve years until Cameron's Avatar (2009) beat the record in 2010.[41] The costumes and sets were very realistic, and The Washington Post considered the CGI graphics to be spectacular.[42][43] Titanic received a record-tie of fourteen nominations (tied with All About Eve (1950)) at the 1998 Academy Awards. It won eleven of the awards (tying the record for most wins with Ben-Hur (1959) and later, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[44] Upon receiving the Best Picture Award, Cameron along with Jon Landau, asked for a moment of silence to remember the 1,500 people who died when the ship sank.[45] Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for being able to combine drama and history, stating \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding\".[46] Reflecting on Titanic in 1999, Sandler and Studlar writes that the mix of romance, historical nostalgia and James Horner's music, contributed to the film's cultural phenomenon.[47] Titanic is Cameron's second film to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Following the huge publicity of Titanic, Cameron maintained a lower profile. In 1998, he and his brother, John, formed Earthship Productions, a company for streaming documentaries on the deep sea, one of Cameron's passions.[48][49] He had planned to do a film about Spider-Man, a project developed by Menahem Golan of Cannon Films. Columbia hired David Koepp to adapt Cameron's ideas into a screenplay, but due to various disagreements, Cameron abandoned the project.[50] In 2002, Spider-Man was released with the screenplay credited solely to Koepp.[51] In 2000, Cameron ventured into television and co-created Dark Angel with Charles H. Eglee, a television series influenced by cyberpunk, biopunk, contemporary superheroes and third-wave feminism. Dark Angel starred Jessica Alba as Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced super-soldier created by a secretive organization. While the first season was moderately successful, the second season did less well, which led to its cancellation. In 2002, Cameron served as producer on the 2002 film Solaris, a science fiction drama directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film received mixed reviews and did poorly at the box office. Keen to make documentaries, Cameron directed Expedition: Bismarck, a documentary about the German Battleship Bismarck. In 2003, he directed Ghosts of the Abyss, a documentary about RMS Titanic which was released by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media and designed for 3D theaters. Cameron also told The Guardian his intention for filming everything in 3D.[52] In 2005, Cameron co-directed Aliens of the Deep, a documentary about the various forms of life in the ocean. He also starred in Titanic Adventure with Tony Robinson, another documentary about the Titanic shipwreck. Then in 2006, Cameron co-created and narrated The Exodus Decoded, a documentary exploring the Biblical account of the Exodus. In 2007, Cameron and fellow director Simcha Jacobovici, produced The Lost Tomb of Jesus. Broadcast on Discovery Channel on March 4, 2007, the documentary was controversial for arguing that the Talpiot Tomb was the burial place of Jesus of Nazareth.[53][54] By the mid-2000s, Cameron returned to directing and producing another big-budget, mainstream film since 1997's Titanic. Cameron had mentioned two projects as early as June 2005.[55] Titled Avatar (2009) and Alita: Battle Angel (2019) (the latter which he produced), both films were to be shot in 3D technology. He also wanted to make Alita: Battle Angel first, followed by Avatar but switched the order in February 2006. Although Cameron had written an 80-page treatment for Avatar in 1995, Cameron stated that he wanted the necessary technology to improve before starting production.[56][57] Avatar, with the story line set in the mid-22nd century, had an estimated budget in excess of $300\u00a0million. The cast includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. It was composed entirely with computer-generated animation, using an advanced version of the performance capture technique, previously used by director Robert Zemeckis in The Polar Express.[58] Cameron intended Avatar to be 3D-only but decided to adapt it for conventional viewing as well.[59] Intended for release in May 2009, Avatar eventually premiered on December 18, 2009. This delay allowed more time for post-production and the opportunity for theatres to install 3D projectors.[60] On release, Avatar broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed $749.7 million in the United States and Canada and more than $2.74 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing Titanic (1997).[61] It was the first film to ever earn more than $2\u00a0billion worldwide. Avatar was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.[62] In July 2010, an extended theatrical re-release generated a worldwide total of $33.2 million at the box office. Vanity Fair reported that Cameron earned $257 million in 2010, making him the highest earner in Hollywood for that year.[63] In 2011, Cameron served as an executive producer for Sanctum (2011), a disaster-survival film about a cave diving expedition which turns deadly. Although receiving mixed reviews, the film earned a fair $108 million at the box office. Cameron re-investigated the sinking of RMS Titanic with eight experts in a 2012 TV documentary special, Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron, which premiered on April 8 on the National Geographic Channel.[64] In the documentary, the experts revised the CGI animation of the sinking conceived in 1995.[65][66] In March 2010, Cameron revealed that Titanic (1997) will be converted and re-released in 3D to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the tragedy.[67] On March 27, 2012, Cameron attended the premiere at Royal Albert Hall, London with his wife and several cast members.[68] He also served as executive producer of Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away and Deepsea Challenge 3D in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Cameron starred in the documentary Atlantis Rising, with previous collaborator Simcha Jacobovci. The pair go on an adventure to explore the existence of the city of Atlantis. The programme aired on January 29, 2017 on the National Geographic channel.[69] Next, Cameron produced and appeared in a documentary about the history of science fiction, stating, \"Without Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, there wouldn't have been Ray Bradbury or Robert A. Heinlein, and without them, there wouldn't be [George] Lucas, [Steven] Spielberg, Ridley Scott or me.\"[70] Titled James Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction, the six-episodic series was broadcast on AMC in 2018.[71] The series featured interviews with guests including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Christopher Nolan and Ridley Scott.[72] Alita: Battle Angel (2019) was finally released after being in parallel development with Avatar. Written by Cameron and close friend, Jon Landau, the film was directed by Robert Rodriguez.[73] The film, based on a 1990s Japanese manga series Battle Angel Alita, depicts a cyborg who cannot remember anything of her past life and tries to uncover the truth. Produced with similar techniques and technology as used in Avatar, the film starred Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson. The film premiered on January 31, 2019 in London and received generally positive reviews from critics, and was financially successful, earning $404 million worldwide.[74] In her review, Monica Castillo of RogerEbert.com called it, \"an awe-inspiring jump for [Rodriguez]\" and \"a visual bonanza\" despite the bulky script.[75] Cameron returned to the Terminator franchise as producer and writer for Terminator: Dark Fate (2019), with Tim Miller as director.[76] The film opened on November 1, 2019. In August 2013, Cameron announced plans to direct three sequels to Avatar simultaneously, for release in December 2016, 2017, and 2018.[77] However, the release dates have been postponed to December 17, 2021, with the following three sequels to be released, respectively, on December 22, 2023, December 19, 2025 and December 17, 2027.[78][79] Deadline Hollywood estimated that the budget for these would be over $1 billion in total.[80] Avatar 2 and Avatar 3 began simultaneous production in Manhattan Beach, California on August 15, 2017. Principal photography began in New Zealand on September 25, 2017.[81][82][83][84][85][86] The other sequels are expected to begin production as soon as Avatar 2 and 3 have finished.[87][88][89] Although the sequels 4 and 5 have been given the green-light, Cameron stated in a 2017 interview, \"Let's face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don't make enough money, there's not going to be a 4 and 5\".[90] Lightstorm Entertainment bought the film rights to the Taylor Stevens novel, The Informationist, a thriller set in Africa. Cameron plans to direct it.[91] He is also working on a film adaptation of the Charles R. Pellegrino book The Last Train from Hiroshima, which is about the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cameron met with survivor, Tsutomu Yamaguchi, before his death in 2010.[92] As of 2012, Cameron and his family have adopted a vegan diet.[93][94] Cameron states that \"by changing what you eat, you will change the entire contract between the human species and the natural world\".[95] He and his wife Suzy are advocates of plant-based food and have called for constructive actions to produce more plant-based food and less meat to mitigate the impact of climate change.[96] In 2006, Cameron's wife co-founded MUSE School, which became the first K-12 vegan school in the United States.[97] In early 2014, Cameron purchased the Beaufort Vineyard and Estate Winery in Courtenay, British Columbia for $2.7 million, to pursue his passion for sustainable agribusiness.[98] In 2018, Cameron served as executive producer of The Game Changers, a documentary showcasing vegan athletes and other celebrities. In June 2019, Cameron announced a business venture with film director Peter Jackson, to produce plant-based meat, cheese, and dairy products in New Zealand. He suggested that we need \"a nice transition to a meatless or relatively meatless world in 20 or 30 years.\"[99] In June 2010, Cameron met with officials of the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss possible solutions to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It was reported that he offered his assistance to help stop the oil well from leaking but was ignored.[100][101][102] Cameron is a member of the NASA Advisory Council and he worked with the space agency to build cameras for the Curiosity rover sent for Mars.[103] However, NASA, launched the rover without Cameron's technology due to a lack of time during testing.[104] He has expressed interest in a project about Mars, stating \"I've been very interested in the Humans to Mars movement [...] and I've done a tremendous amount of personal research for a novel, a miniseries, and a 3D film.\"[105] Cameron is a member of the Mars Society, a non-profit organization lobbying for the colonization of Mars.[106][107] In 2016, Cameron endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[108] Cameron has been married five times.[109] He was married to Sharon Williams from 1978 to 1984. A year after he and Sharon divorced, Cameron married film producer Gale Anne Hurd, a close collaborator for his 1980s films. They divorced in 1989. Soon after separating from Hurd, Cameron met the director Kathryn Bigelow whom he wed in 1989, but they divorced in 1991. Cameron then began a relationship with Linda Hamilton, actress in The Terminator series. Their daughter was born in 1993. Cameron married Hamilton in 1997. Amid speculation of an affair between Cameron and actress Suzy Amis, Cameron and Hamilton separated after two years of marriage, with Hamilton receiving a settlement of $50 million.[110][111][112] He married Amis, his fifth wife, in 2000. They have one son and two daughters together. Cameron has resided in the United States since 1971, but he remains a Canadian citizen. Cameron applied for American citizenship in 2004, but withdrew his application after George W. Bush won the presidential election.[113] Captivated by New Zealand while filming Avatar, Cameron bought a home there.[114][115][116] He divides his time between California and New Zealand.[117] Cameron has said he is a \"Converted Agnostic\", adding \"I've sworn off agnosticism, which I now call cowardly atheism\".[48] Cameron met close friend Guillermo del Toro on the production of his 1993 film, Cronos.[118] In 1998, del Toro's father was kidnapped in Guadalajara. Cameron gave del Toro more than $1 million in cash to pay a ransom and have his father released.[118][119][120] Cameron became an expert on deep-sea exploration, in part because of his work on The Abyss and Titanic[100], as well as his childhood fascination with shipwrecks. In 2011, Cameron became a National Geographic explorer-in-residence.[121] In his role, on March 7, 2012, he dived five-mile deep to the bottom of the New Britain Trench with the Deepsea Challenger.[122] 19 days later, Cameron reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the Mariana Trench.[5][123] He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor, becoming the first to accomplish the trip alone.[5][124] During his dive to the Challenger Deep, he discovered new species of sea cucumber, squid worm and a giant single-celled amoeba.[125] He was preceded by unmanned dives in 1995 and 2009, as well as by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, the first men to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench aboard the Bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960.[126] In June 2013, British artist Roger Dean filed a copyright complaint against Cameron, seeking damages of $50 million.[127] Accused of \"wilful and deliberate copying, dissemination and exploitation\" of his original images (relating to Avatar), the case was dismissed by U.S district judge Jesse Ferman in 2014.[128] In 2016, Premier Exhibitions, owner of many RMS Titanic artifacts, filed for bankruptcy. Cameron supported the U.K.'s National Maritime Museum and National Museums Northern Ireland decision to bid for the artifacts, but they were acquired by an investment group before a formal bid took place.[129][130] \u2013\u00a0Orson Scott Card, author of The Abyss on Cameron[131] Cameron has been regarded as an innovative filmmaker in the industry, as well as not easy to work for.[132][133][134] According to Ed Harris, who worked with Cameron on The Abyss (1989), Cameron behaved in an autocratic manner.[28] Keegan, author of The Futurist: The Life and Films of James Cameron, describes Cameron as \"comically hands-on\" and would try to do every job on the set.[132] Andrew Gumbel, of The Independent says Cameron \"is a nightmare to work with. Studios [...] fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, as well as his flaming temper.\"[135] Keller writes that Cameron is an egomaniac, obsessed with vision but praises his \"technological ingenuity\" at creating a \"visceral viewing experience\".[42] Speaking of her experience of filming Titanic, Kate Winslet said that she admired Cameron but \"there were times I was genuinely frightened of him\".[136] Describing him as having \"a temper like you wouldn't believe\", she had said she wouldn't work with him again unless it was \"for a lot of money\".[137] Her co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, told Esquire magazine, \"when somebody felt a different way on the set, there was a confrontation. He lets you know exactly how he feels\", but complimented Cameron, \"he's of the lineage of John Ford. He knows what he wants his film to be.\"[138] Sam Worthington, who starred in Avatar, said that if a mobile phone rang during filming, Cameron would \"nail it to the wall with a nail gun.\"[139] Film score composer James Horner was also not immune to Cameron's demands; he recalls having to write music in a short time frame for Cameron's 1986 film Aliens.[140] After the uneasy experience, Horner did not work with Cameron for a decade.[141] In 1996, they reconciled their friendship and Horner produced the soundtracks for Titanic and Avatar.[142] Despite this reputation, Bill Paxton and Sigourney Weaver have praised Cameron's perfectionism and attention to detail. Weaver said, \"He really does want us to risk our lives and limbs for the shot, but he doesn't mind risking his own\".[137] In 2015, Weaver, along with Jamie Lee Curtis, applauded Cameron again. Curtis remarked, \"he can do every other job [than acting]. I'm talking about every single department, from art direction to props to wardrobe to cameras, he knows more than everyone doing the job [..] He is so generous to actors.\" Weaver referred to Cameron as a \"genius\".[143] Michael Biehn, a frequent collaborator, also praised Cameron, saying \"Jim is a really passionate person. He cares more about his movies than other directors care about their movies\", adding, \"I've never seen him yell at anybody.\" Biehn, however, acknowledged that Cameron is \"not real [sic] sensitive when it comes to actors and their trailers, and waiting for actors to come to the set\".[144] Sam Worthington commented, \"He demands excellence. If you don't give it to him, you're going to get chewed out. And that's a good thing.\"[137] When asked in 2012 about his reputation, Cameron drily responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have to shout any more, because the word is out there already.\"[145] Cameron's work has had an influence in the Hollywood film industry. The Avengers (2012), a film directed by Joss Whedon, was inspired by Cameron's approach to action sequences.[146] Whedon also admires Cameron's ability for writing heroic female characters such as Ellen Ripley (of Aliens),[147] adding that he is \"the leader and the teacher and the Yoda\".[146] Film director, Michael Bay idolizes Cameron and was convinced by him to use 3D cameras for filming Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).[148] Cameron's approach to 3D also inspired Baz Luhrmann during the production of The Great Gatsby (2013).[149] Other directors that have been inspired by Cameron include Peter Jackson, Neill Blomkamp, and Xavier Dolan.[150][151][152] Cameron's films are often based on themes which explore: the conflicts between intelligent machines and humanity or nature,[153][154] dangers of corporate greed,[155] strong female characters and a romance subplot.[156] Characters suffering from emotionally intense and dramatic environments in the sea wilderness are explored in The Abyss and Titanic. The Terminator series amplifies technology as an enemy which could lead to devastation of mankind. Similarly, Avatar views tribal people as an honest group, whereas a \"technologically advanced imperial culture is fundamentally evil.\"[157] Cameron received the inaugural Ray Bradbury Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1992 for Terminator 2: Judgment Day.[158] In recognition of \"a distinguished career as a Canadian filmmaker\", Carleton University, Ottawa, awarded Cameron the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts on June 13, 1998.[159] He also received an honorary doctorate in 1998 from Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, for his accomplishments in the international film industry.[160] That year, Cameron attended a convocation to receive an honorary degree from Ryerson University, Toronto.[159] The university awards its highest honor to those who have made extraordinary contributions in Canada or internationally. A year later, Cameron received the honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from California State University, Fullerton.[161] He accepted the degree at the university's summer annual commencement exercise.[162] For his work in film, Cameron's films have been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. For Titanic, he won Best Director, Best Picture (shared with Jon Landau) and Best Film Editing (shared with Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris). Cameron is one of the few directors to have won three Academy Awards in a single year. In 2009, Cameron was nominated for awards in Best Film Editing (shared with John Refoua and Stephen E. Rivkin,[163] Best Director and Best Picture for Avatar. Cameron has won two Golden Globes: Best Director for Titanic and Avatar. He was nominated for a number of BAFTA Awards, such as in Best Film for the same titles. In recognition of his contributions to underwater filming and remote vehicle technology, University of Southampton awarded Cameron the honorary degree of Doctor of the University in July 2004. Cameron accepted the award at the National Oceanography Centre.[164] In 2008, Cameron received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame[165] and a year later, received the 2,396th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[166] On February 28, 2010, Cameron was honored with a Visual Effects Society (VES) Lifetime Achievement Award.[167] In June 2012, Cameron was inducted to The Science Fiction Hall of Fame at the Museum of Pop Culture for his contribution to the science fiction and fantasy field.[168] Inspired by Avatar, Disney constructed Pandora \u2013 The World of Avatar, a themed area at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida.[169] It opened to the public on May 27, 2017.[170] A species of frog, Pristimantis jamescameroni, was named after Cameron for his work in promoting environmental awareness and advocacy of veganism.[171][172][173] In 2010, Cameron was ranked at the top of the list in The Guardian Film Power 100.[174] In the same year, British magazine New Statesman ranked Cameron 30th place in their list of \"The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010\".[175] In 2013, Cameron received the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the Public, which is annually awarded by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.[176] In 2019 Cameron was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada by Governor General Julie Payette. This will give him the Post Nominal Letters \"CC\" for Life. [177] As a director: Cameron has frequently cast the same actors in films that he has directed, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Biehn. Bill Paxton appeared in five of Cameron's films before Paxton's death in 2017. Lance Henriksen and Jenette Goldstein have appeared in four and three of Cameron's films, respectively. For the Avatar sequels, much of the original cast will be reuniting with Cameron: C.C.H. Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang and Zoe Saldana. 1 Apart from acting, Wisher Jr. also collaborated with Cameron in writing credits.2 Biehn's reprise of the role of Kyle Reese was cut from the theatrical release, but was restored in the Special Edition on DVD/Blu-ray.",

He found further critical and commercial success with Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and True Lies (1994). His greatest big-budget productions have been Titanic (1997) and Avatar (2009), the former earning him Academy Awards in Best Picture, Best Director and Best Film Editing. Avatar, filmed in 3D technology, also garnered him nominations in the same categories.\nHe also co-founded Lightstorm Entertainment, Digital Domain and Earthship Productions. In addition to his filmmaking, he is a National Geographic explorer of the sea and has produced a number of documentaries on the subject. Cameron contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technologies and helped create the digital 3D Fusion Camera System.[2][3][4] In 2012, Cameron became the first person to perform a solo descent to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Earth's ocean, in the Deepsea Challenger submersible.[5][6]\nIn total, Cameron's films have grossed approximately US$2\u00a0billion in North America and US$6\u00a0billion worldwide. Cameron's Avatar and Titanic are the second and third highest-grossing films of all time, earning $2.78\u00a0billion and $2.19\u00a0billion, respectively. Cameron holds the achievement of having directed the first two of the five films in history to gross over $2 billion worldwide.[7] In 2010, Time magazine named Cameron one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[8]\nCameron was born in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, to Philip Cameron, an electrical engineer, and Shirley (n\u00e9e Lowe), an artist and nurse.[9] His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825.[9] Cameron is the eldest of five siblings[10] and as a child he described the Lord's Prayer as a \"tribal chant\".[11] He attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls. At age 17, Cameron and his family moved from Chippawa, Ontario to Brea, California.[12] He attended Sonora High School and then moved to Brea Olinda High School. Classmates recalled that he was not a sportsman but instead enjoyed building things that \"either went up into the air or into the deep\".[10]\nAfter high school, Cameron enrolled at Fullerton College, a community college in 1973 to study physics. He switched subjects to English, but left the college at the end of 1974.[13] He worked odd jobs, including as a truck driver and janitor, but writing in his free time.[14] During this period, he learnt about special effects by reading other students' work on \"optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology\" at the library.[15] After excitement of seeing Star Wars in 1977, Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry.[16]\nCameron's directing career began in 1978. After borrowing money from a consortium of dentists, he learnt to direct, write and produce his first short film, Xenogenesis (1978) with a friend.[17] Learning as they went, he has said that he felt like a doctor doing his first surgical procedure.[15] He then served as a production assistant for Rock and Roll High School (1979). While educating himself about film-making techniques, Cameron started a job as a miniature model maker at Roger Corman Studios.[14][18] He was soon employed as an art director in the science-fiction film Battle Beyond the Stars (1980). He carried out the special effects for John Carpenter's Escape from New York (1981), served as production designer for Galaxy of Terror (1981), and consulted on the design for Android (1982).\nCameron was hired as the special effects director for the sequel to Piranha (1978), titled Piranha II: The Spawning in 1982. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with producer Ovidio Assonitis. Shot in Rome, Italy and on Grand Cayman Island, the film gave Cameron the opportunity to become director for a major film for the first time. However, Cameron later said that it did not feel like his first movie due to power-struggles with Assonitis.[19] Disillusioned from being in Rome and suffering from a fever, Cameron had a nightmare about an invincible robot hit-man sent from the future to assassinate him, which later led to the inspiration of The Terminator (1984).[20] Upon release of Piranha II: The Spawning, critics were not impressed. Tim Healey, in his book, called it \"a marvellously bad movie which splices cliches from every conceivable source.\"[21]\nInspired by John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and other science fiction work, Cameron wrote the script for The Terminator (1984) in 1982, which is a thriller about cyborg sent from the future to carry out a lethal mission. Cameron wanted to sell the script so that he could direct the movie. Whilst some film studios expressed interested in the project, many executives were unwilling to let a new and unfamiliar director make the movie. Gale Anne Hurd, a colleague and founder of Pacific Western Productions, to whom Cameron was married from 1984 to 1989, agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Eventually, he convinced the president of Hemdale Pictures to make the film, with Cameron as director and Hurd as a producer. Lance Henriksen, who had starred in Piranha II: The Spawning, was considered for the lead role, but Cameron decided that Arnold Schwarzenegger was more suitable as the cyborg villain due to his bodybuilder appearance. Henriksen was given a smaller role instead. Michael Biehn and Cameron's future wife, Linda Hamilton, also joined the cast. The Terminator was a box office success, exceeding expectations set by Orion Pictures, who thought that the film would be short-lived in theaters.[11] The movie proved popular with audiences and earned over $78\u00a0million worldwide, from a budget of $6.5\u00a0million.[22] In 2008, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[23]\n\nIn 1984, Cameron co-wrote the screenplay to Rambo: First Blood Part II with Sylvester Stallone.[24] Soon, Cameron moved onto his next directorial feature, which was the sequel to Alien (1979), a science fiction horror by Ridley Scott. After titling the sequel Aliens (1986), Cameron recast Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, who first appeared in Alien. Aliens follows the protagonist, Ripley, as she helps a group of marines fight off extraterrestrials. Despite conflicts with cast and crew during production, and having to replace one of the lead actors\u2014James Remar with Michael Biehn\u2014Aliens was a box office success, generating over $130 million worldwide.[25] The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1987; Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score and Best Sound. It won awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. In addition, the film including Weaver made the cover of TIME magazine in July 1986.[26]After Aliens, Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd decided to make The Abyss, a story of oil-rig workers who discover strange intelligent life in the ocean. Based on an idea which Cameron had conceived of during high school, the film was initially budgeted at $41\u00a0million, although it ran considerably over this amount. It starred Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The production process began in the Cayman Islands and then at South Carolina, inside the building of an unfinished nuclear power plant with two huge tanks.[27] The cast and crew recall Cameron's tough demands and filming the underwater scenes which were physically exhausting for everyone.[28] Upon the film's release, The Abyss was praised for its special effects, and earned $90 million at the worldwide box office.[29] The Abyss received four Academy Award nominations and won Best Visual Effects.\nIn 1990, Cameron co-founded the firm Lightstorm Entertainment with partner Lawrence Kasanoff. In 1991, Cameron served as executive producer for Point Break (1991), directed by former wife Kathryn Bigelow. After the success of The Terminator, there were discussions for a sequel. In the late 1980s, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to begin production of the film, titled Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Written by Cameron and William Wisher Jr., lead actors Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprised their earlier roles. The story follows on from the first Terminator film, depicting a new villain (T-1000), possessing shape-shifting ability and hunts for Sarah Connor's son. Cameron cast Robert Patrick as T-1000 because of his lean and thin appearance\u2014a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained, \"I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human Panzer tank, then the T-1000 is a Porsche.\"[30] Like its predecessor, Terminator 2 was one of the most expensive films to be produced, costing at least $94 million.[31] Despite the challenging use of computer-generated imagery, the film was completed on time and released on July 3, 1991. Terminator 2: Judgment Day broke box office records (including the opening weekend record for an R-rated film), earning over $200\u00a0million in the North America and being the first to earn over $300\u00a0million worldwide.[32] It won four Academy Awards: Best Makeup, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It also received nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, but lost both to political thriller JFK.\nIn subsequent years, Cameron planned to do a third Terminator film but plans never materialized. The rights to the Terminator franchise were eventually purchased by Kassar from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco's assets.[33] He moved onto other projects and in 1993, Cameron co-founded Digital Domain, a visual effects production company. In 1994, Cameron and Schwarzenegger reunited for their third collaboration, titled True Lies (1994), a remake of the 1991 French comedy La Totale! The story depicts an American secret agent who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. The film co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Eliza Dushku and Tom Arnold. Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment signed a deal with 20th Century Fox for the production of True Lies. Budgeted at a minimum of $100\u00a0million, the film earned $146\u00a0million in North America, and $232\u00a0million worldwide.[34][35] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Curtis won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. In 1995, Cameron co-produced Strange Days (1995), a science fiction thriller. The film was directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by Jay Cocks.[36] Strange Days was critically and financially unsuccessful. In 1996, Cameron reunited with the cast of Terminator 2 to film T2 3-D: Battle Across Time, an attraction at Universal Studios Florida[37] and at other parks around the world.\n\nHis next major project was Titanic (1997), an epic film about RMS\u00a0Titanic which sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg. With a production budget of $200\u00a0million, Titanic is one of the most expensive films ever made. The production was troubled for being over-budget and exceeding its filming schedule, which made headlines before the film's release.[38][39] Starting in 1995, Cameron took several dives to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to capture footage of the wreck, which would later be used in the film.[40] A replica of the ship was built in Rosarito Beach and principal photography began in September 1996. His completed screenplay depicts two star-crossed lovers, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, from different social classes who fall in love amid the backdrop of the tragedy\u2014a sharp turn from Cameron's previous films. The supporting cast included Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, David Warner and Bill Paxton.After months of delay, Titanic premiered on December 19, 1997. Titanic received strong critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, and held this position for twelve years until Cameron's Avatar (2009) beat the record in 2010.[41] The costumes and sets were very realistic, and The Washington Post considered the CGI graphics to be spectacular.[42][43] Titanic received a record-tie of fourteen nominations (tied with All About Eve (1950)) at the 1998 Academy Awards. It won eleven of the awards (tying the record for most wins with Ben-Hur (1959) and later, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[44] Upon receiving the Best Picture Award, Cameron along with Jon Landau, asked for a moment of silence to remember the 1,500 people who died when the ship sank.[45] Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for being able to combine drama and history, stating \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding\".[46] Reflecting on Titanic in 1999, Sandler and Studlar writes that the mix of romance, historical nostalgia and James Horner's music, contributed to the film's cultural phenomenon.[47] Titanic is Cameron's second film to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nFollowing the huge publicity of Titanic, Cameron maintained a lower profile. In 1998, he and his brother, John, formed Earthship Productions, a company for streaming documentaries on the deep sea, one of Cameron's passions.[48][49] He had planned to do a film about Spider-Man, a project developed by Menahem Golan of Cannon Films. Columbia hired David Koepp to adapt Cameron's ideas into a screenplay, but due to various disagreements, Cameron abandoned the project.[50] In 2002, Spider-Man was released with the screenplay credited solely to Koepp.[51] In 2000, Cameron ventured into television and co-created Dark Angel with Charles H. Eglee, a television series influenced by cyberpunk, biopunk, contemporary superheroes and third-wave feminism. Dark Angel starred Jessica Alba as Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced super-soldier created by a secretive organization. While the first season was moderately successful, the second season did less well, which led to its cancellation.\nIn 2002, Cameron served as producer on the 2002 film Solaris, a science fiction drama directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film received mixed reviews and did poorly at the box office. Keen to make documentaries, Cameron directed Expedition: Bismarck, a documentary about the German Battleship Bismarck. In 2003, he directed Ghosts of the Abyss, a documentary about RMS Titanic which was released by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media and designed for 3D theaters. Cameron also told The Guardian his intention for filming everything in 3D.[52] In 2005, Cameron co-directed Aliens of the Deep, a documentary about the various forms of life in the ocean. He also starred in Titanic Adventure with Tony Robinson, another documentary about the Titanic shipwreck. Then in 2006, Cameron co-created and narrated The Exodus Decoded, a documentary exploring the Biblical account of the Exodus. In 2007, Cameron and fellow director Simcha Jacobovici, produced The Lost Tomb of Jesus. Broadcast on Discovery Channel on March 4, 2007, the documentary was controversial for arguing that the Talpiot Tomb was the burial place of Jesus of Nazareth.[53][54]\nBy the mid-2000s, Cameron returned to directing and producing another big-budget, mainstream film since 1997's Titanic. Cameron had mentioned two projects as early as June 2005.[55] Titled Avatar (2009) and Alita: Battle Angel (2019) (the latter which he produced), both films were to be shot in 3D technology. He also wanted to make Alita: Battle Angel first, followed by Avatar but switched the order in February 2006. Although Cameron had written an 80-page treatment for Avatar in 1995, Cameron stated that he wanted the necessary technology to improve before starting production.[56][57] Avatar, with the story line set in the mid-22nd century, had an estimated budget in excess of $300\u00a0million. The cast includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. It was composed entirely with computer-generated animation, using an advanced version of the performance capture technique, previously used by director Robert Zemeckis in The Polar Express.[58] Cameron intended Avatar to be 3D-only but decided to adapt it for conventional viewing as well.[59]\nIntended for release in May 2009, Avatar eventually premiered on December 18, 2009. This delay allowed more time for post-production and the opportunity for theatres to install 3D projectors.[60] On release, Avatar broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed $749.7 million in the United States and Canada and more than $2.74 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing Titanic (1997).[61] It was the first film to ever earn more than $2\u00a0billion worldwide. Avatar was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.[62] In July 2010, an extended theatrical re-release generated a worldwide total of $33.2 million at the box office. Vanity Fair reported that Cameron earned $257 million in 2010, making him the highest earner in Hollywood for that year.[63]\nIn 2011, Cameron served as an executive producer for Sanctum (2011), a disaster-survival film about a cave diving expedition which turns deadly. Although receiving mixed reviews, the film earned a fair $108 million at the box office. Cameron re-investigated the sinking of RMS Titanic with eight experts in a 2012 TV documentary special, Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron, which premiered on April 8 on the National Geographic Channel.[64] In the documentary, the experts revised the CGI animation of the sinking conceived in 1995.[65][66] In March 2010, Cameron revealed that Titanic (1997) will be converted and re-released in 3D to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the tragedy.[67] On March 27, 2012, Cameron attended the premiere at Royal Albert Hall, London with his wife and several cast members.[68] He also served as executive producer of Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away and Deepsea Challenge 3D in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\nCameron starred in the documentary Atlantis Rising, with previous collaborator Simcha Jacobovci. The pair go on an adventure to explore the existence of the city of Atlantis. The programme aired on January 29, 2017 on the National Geographic channel.[69] Next, Cameron produced and appeared in a documentary about the history of science fiction, stating, \"Without Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, there wouldn't have been Ray Bradbury or Robert A. Heinlein, and without them, there wouldn't be [George] Lucas, [Steven] Spielberg, Ridley Scott or me.\"[70] Titled James Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction, the six-episodic series was broadcast on AMC in 2018.[71] The series featured interviews with guests including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Christopher Nolan and Ridley Scott.[72]\nAlita: Battle Angel (2019) was finally released after being in parallel development with Avatar. Written by Cameron and close friend, Jon Landau, the film was directed by Robert Rodriguez.[73] The film, based on a 1990s Japanese manga series Battle Angel Alita, depicts a cyborg who cannot remember anything of her past life and tries to uncover the truth. Produced with similar techniques and technology as used in Avatar, the film starred Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson. The film premiered on January 31, 2019 in London and received generally positive reviews from critics, and was financially successful, earning $404 million worldwide.[74] In her review, Monica Castillo of RogerEbert.com called it, \"an awe-inspiring jump for [Rodriguez]\" and \"a visual bonanza\" despite the bulky script.[75] Cameron returned to the Terminator franchise as producer and writer for Terminator: Dark Fate (2019), with Tim Miller as director.[76] The film opened on November 1, 2019.\nIn August 2013, Cameron announced plans to direct three sequels to Avatar simultaneously, for release in December 2016, 2017, and 2018.[77] However, the release dates have been postponed to December 17, 2021, with the following three sequels to be released, respectively, on December 22, 2023, December 19, 2025 and December 17, 2027.[78][79] Deadline Hollywood estimated that the budget for these would be over $1 billion in total.[80] Avatar 2 and Avatar 3 began simultaneous production in Manhattan Beach, California on August 15, 2017. Principal photography began in New Zealand on September 25, 2017.[81][82][83][84][85][86] The other sequels are expected to begin production as soon as Avatar 2 and 3 have finished.[87][88][89] Although the sequels 4 and 5 have been given the green-light, Cameron stated in a 2017 interview, \"Let's face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don't make enough money, there's not going to be a 4 and 5\".[90]\nLightstorm Entertainment bought the film rights to the Taylor Stevens novel, The Informationist, a thriller set in Africa. Cameron plans to direct it.[91] He is also working on a film adaptation of the Charles R. Pellegrino book The Last Train from Hiroshima, which is about the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cameron met with survivor, Tsutomu Yamaguchi, before his death in 2010.[92]\nAs of 2012, Cameron and his family have adopted a vegan diet.[93][94] Cameron states that \"by changing what you eat, you will change the entire contract between the human species and the natural world\".[95] He and his wife Suzy are advocates of plant-based food and have called for constructive actions to produce more plant-based food and less meat to mitigate the impact of climate change.[96] In 2006, Cameron's wife co-founded MUSE School, which became the first K-12 vegan school in the United States.[97] In early 2014, Cameron purchased the Beaufort Vineyard and Estate Winery in Courtenay, British Columbia for $2.7 million, to pursue his passion for sustainable agribusiness.[98] In 2018, Cameron served as executive producer of The Game Changers, a documentary showcasing vegan athletes and other celebrities. In June 2019, Cameron announced a business venture with film director Peter Jackson, to produce plant-based meat, cheese, and dairy products in New Zealand. He suggested that we need \"a nice transition to a meatless or relatively meatless world in 20 or 30 years.\"[99]\nIn June 2010, Cameron met with officials of the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss possible solutions to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It was reported that he offered his assistance to help stop the oil well from leaking but was ignored.[100][101][102] Cameron is a member of the NASA Advisory Council and he worked with the space agency to build cameras for the Curiosity rover sent for Mars.[103] However, NASA, launched the rover without Cameron's technology due to a lack of time during testing.[104] He has expressed interest in a project about Mars, stating \"I've been very interested in the Humans to Mars movement [...] and I've done a tremendous amount of personal research for a novel, a miniseries, and a 3D film.\"[105] Cameron is a member of the Mars Society, a non-profit organization lobbying for the colonization of Mars.[106][107] In 2016, Cameron endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[108]\nCameron has been married five times.[109] He was married to Sharon Williams from 1978 to 1984. A year after he and Sharon divorced, Cameron married film producer Gale Anne Hurd, a close collaborator for his 1980s films. They divorced in 1989. Soon after separating from Hurd, Cameron met the director Kathryn Bigelow whom he wed in 1989, but they divorced in 1991. Cameron then began a relationship with Linda Hamilton, actress in The Terminator series. Their daughter was born in 1993. Cameron married Hamilton in 1997. Amid speculation of an affair between Cameron and actress Suzy Amis, Cameron and Hamilton separated after two years of marriage, with Hamilton receiving a settlement of $50 million.[110][111][112] He married Amis, his fifth wife, in 2000. They have one son and two daughters together.\nCameron has resided in the United States since 1971, but he remains a Canadian citizen. Cameron applied for American citizenship in 2004, but withdrew his application after George W. Bush won the presidential election.[113] Captivated by New Zealand while filming Avatar, Cameron bought a home there.[114][115][116] He divides his time between California and New Zealand.[117] Cameron has said he is a \"Converted Agnostic\", adding \"I've sworn off agnosticism, which I now call cowardly atheism\".[48] Cameron met close friend Guillermo del Toro on the production of his 1993 film, Cronos.[118] In 1998, del Toro's father was kidnapped in Guadalajara. Cameron gave del Toro more than $1 million in cash to pay a ransom and have his father released.[118][119][120]\nCameron became an expert on deep-sea exploration, in part because of his work on The Abyss and Titanic[100], as well as his childhood fascination with shipwrecks. In 2011, Cameron became a National Geographic explorer-in-residence.[121] In his role, on March 7, 2012, he dived five-mile deep to the bottom of the New Britain Trench with the Deepsea Challenger.[122] 19 days later, Cameron reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the Mariana Trench.[5][123] He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor, becoming the first to accomplish the trip alone.[5][124] During his dive to the Challenger Deep, he discovered new species of sea cucumber, squid worm and a giant single-celled amoeba.[125] He was preceded by unmanned dives in 1995 and 2009, as well as by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, the first men to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench aboard the Bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960.[126]\nIn June 2013, British artist Roger Dean filed a copyright complaint against Cameron, seeking damages of $50 million.[127] Accused of \"wilful and deliberate copying, dissemination and exploitation\" of his original images (relating to Avatar), the case was dismissed by U.S district judge Jesse Ferman in 2014.[128] In 2016, Premier Exhibitions, owner of many RMS Titanic artifacts, filed for bankruptcy. Cameron supported the U.K.'s National Maritime Museum and National Museums Northern Ireland decision to bid for the artifacts, but they were acquired by an investment group before a formal bid took place.[129][130]\n\u2013\u00a0Orson Scott Card, author of The Abyss on Cameron[131]\nCameron has been regarded as an innovative filmmaker in the industry, as well as not easy to work for.[132][133][134] According to Ed Harris, who worked with Cameron on The Abyss (1989), Cameron behaved in an autocratic manner.[28] Keegan, author of The Futurist: The Life and Films of James Cameron, describes Cameron as \"comically hands-on\" and would try to do every job on the set.[132] Andrew Gumbel, of The Independent says Cameron \"is a nightmare to work with. Studios [...] fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, as well as his flaming temper.\"[135] Keller writes that Cameron is an egomaniac, obsessed with vision but praises his \"technological ingenuity\" at creating a \"visceral viewing experience\".[42]\nSpeaking of her experience of filming Titanic, Kate Winslet said that she admired Cameron but \"there were times I was genuinely frightened of him\".[136] Describing him as having \"a temper like you wouldn't believe\", she had said she wouldn't work with him again unless it was \"for a lot of money\".[137] Her co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, told Esquire magazine, \"when somebody felt a different way on the set, there was a confrontation. He lets you know exactly how he feels\", but complimented Cameron, \"he's of the lineage of John Ford. He knows what he wants his film to be.\"[138] Sam Worthington, who starred in Avatar, said that if a mobile phone rang during filming, Cameron would \"nail it to the wall with a nail gun.\"[139] Film score composer James Horner was also not immune to Cameron's demands; he recalls having to write music in a short time frame for Cameron's 1986 film Aliens.[140] After the uneasy experience, Horner did not work with Cameron for a decade.[141] In 1996, they reconciled their friendship and Horner produced the soundtracks for Titanic and Avatar.[142]\nDespite this reputation, Bill Paxton and Sigourney Weaver have praised Cameron's perfectionism and attention to detail. Weaver said, \"He really does want us to risk our lives and limbs for the shot, but he doesn't mind risking his own\".[137] In 2015, Weaver, along with Jamie Lee Curtis, applauded Cameron again. Curtis remarked, \"he can do every other job [than acting]. I'm talking about every single department, from art direction to props to wardrobe to cameras, he knows more than everyone doing the job [..] He is so generous to actors.\" Weaver referred to Cameron as a \"genius\".[143] Michael Biehn, a frequent collaborator, also praised Cameron, saying \"Jim is a really passionate person. He cares more about his movies than other directors care about their movies\", adding, \"I've never seen him yell at anybody.\" Biehn, however, acknowledged that Cameron is \"not real [sic] sensitive when it comes to actors and their trailers, and waiting for actors to come to the set\".[144] Sam Worthington commented, \"He demands excellence. If you don't give it to him, you're going to get chewed out. And that's a good thing.\"[137] When asked in 2012 about his reputation, Cameron drily responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have to shout any more, because the word is out there already.\"[145]\nCameron's work has had an influence in the Hollywood film industry. The Avengers (2012), a film directed by Joss Whedon, was inspired by Cameron's approach to action sequences.[146] Whedon also admires Cameron's ability for writing heroic female characters such as Ellen Ripley (of Aliens),[147] adding that he is \"the leader and the teacher and the Yoda\".[146] Film director, Michael Bay idolizes Cameron and was convinced by him to use 3D cameras for filming Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).[148] Cameron's approach to 3D also inspired Baz Luhrmann during the production of The Great Gatsby (2013).[149] Other directors that have been inspired by Cameron include Peter Jackson, Neill Blomkamp, and Xavier Dolan.[150][151][152]\nCameron's films are often based on themes which explore: the conflicts between intelligent machines and humanity or nature,[153][154] dangers of corporate greed,[155] strong female characters and a romance subplot.[156] Characters suffering from emotionally intense and dramatic environments in the sea wilderness are explored in The Abyss and Titanic. The Terminator series amplifies technology as an enemy which could lead to devastation of mankind. Similarly, Avatar views tribal people as an honest group, whereas a \"technologically advanced imperial culture is fundamentally evil.\"[157]\nCameron received the inaugural Ray Bradbury Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1992 for Terminator 2: Judgment Day.[158] In recognition of \"a distinguished career as a Canadian filmmaker\", Carleton University, Ottawa, awarded Cameron the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts on June 13, 1998.[159] He also received an honorary doctorate in 1998 from Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, for his accomplishments in the international film industry.[160]\nThat year, Cameron attended a convocation to receive an honorary degree from Ryerson University, Toronto.[159] The university awards its highest honor to those who have made extraordinary contributions in Canada or internationally. A year later, Cameron received the honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from California State University, Fullerton.[161] He accepted the degree at the university's summer annual commencement exercise.[162]\nFor his work in film, Cameron's films have been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. For Titanic, he won Best Director, Best Picture (shared with Jon Landau) and Best Film Editing (shared with Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris). Cameron is one of the few directors to have won three Academy Awards in a single year. In 2009, Cameron was nominated for awards in Best Film Editing (shared with John Refoua and Stephen E.
