                "text": "no title\n\nBob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter, author, and visual artist who has been a major figure in popular culture for more than fifty years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement. His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Following his self-titled debut album in 1962, which mainly comprised traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan the following year. The album featured \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\". For many of these songs, he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966). Commenting on the six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965), Rolling Stone wrote: \"No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time.\"[3] In July 1966, Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of The Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album The Basement Tapes in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in John Wesley Harding (1967), Nashville Skyline (1969), and New Morning (1970). In 1975, he released Blood on the Tracks, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. The major works of his later career include Time Out of Mind (1997), Love and Theft (2001), Modern Times (2006) and Tempest (2012). His most recent recordings have comprised versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. Since 1994, Dylan has published eight books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 100\u00a0million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"[4] Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman (Hebrew: .mw-parser-output .script-hebrew,.mw-parser-output .script-Hebr{font-size:1.15em;font-family:\"Ezra SIL\",\"Ezra SIL SR\",\"Keter Aram Tsova\",\"Taamey Ashkenaz\",\"Taamey David CLM\",\"Taamey Frank CLM\",\"Frank Ruehl CLM\",\"Keter YG\",\"Shofar\",\"David CLM\",\"Hadasim CLM\",\"Simple CLM\",\"Nachlieli\",\"SBL BibLit\",\"SBL Hebrew\",Cardo,Alef,\"Noto Serif Hebrew\",\"Noto Sans Hebrew\",\"David Libre\",David,\"Times New Roman\",Gisha,Arial,FreeSerif,FreeSans}\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d9\u05e1\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham)[1][5][6] in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota,[7][8] and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Range west of Lake Superior. Dylan's paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the United States following the anti-Semitic pogroms of 1905.[9] His maternal grandparents, Ben and Florence Stone, were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902.[9] In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan wrote that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from the Ka\u011f\u0131zman district of Kars Province in northeastern Turkey.[10] Dylan's father, Abram Zimmerman\u2014an electric-appliance shop owner\u2014and mother, Beatrice \"Beatty\" Stone, were part of a small, close-knit Jewish community.[11][12][13] They lived in Duluth until Dylan was six, when his father had polio and the family returned to his mother's hometown, Hibbing, where they lived for the rest of Dylan's childhood. In his early years he listened to the radio\u2014first to blues and country stations from Shreveport, Louisiana, and later, when he was a teenager, to rock and roll.[14] Dylan formed several bands while attending Hibbing High School. In the Golden Chords, he performed covers of songs by Little Richard[15] and Elvis Presley.[16] Their performance of Danny & the Juniors' \"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone.[17] In 1959, Dylan's high school yearbook carried the caption \"Robert Zimmerman: to join 'Little Richard'.\"[15][18] That year, as Elston Gunnn, he performed two dates with Bobby Vee, playing piano and clapping.[19][20][21] In September 1959, Dylan moved to Minneapolis and enrolled at the University of Minnesota.[22] His focus on rock and roll gave way to American folk music, as he explained in a 1985 interview: The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.[23] Living at the Jewish-centric fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu house, Dylan began to perform at the Ten\u00a0O'Clock Scholar, a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus, and became involved in the Dinkytown folk music circuit.[24][25] During this period, he began introducing himself as \"Bob Dylan.\"[26][a 1] In his memoir, he said he hit upon using this less common variant for Dillon\u2014a surname he had considered adopting\u2014when he unexpectedly saw poems by Dylan Thomas.[27] Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, he said, \"You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free.\"[28] In May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie,[29] who was seriously ill with Huntington's disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.[30] Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. Describing Guthrie's impact, he wrote: \"The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple.\"[31] As well as visiting Guthrie in hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ramblin' Jack Elliott. Much of Guthrie's repertoire was channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in Chronicles: Volume One.[32] From February 1961, Dylan played at clubs around Greenwich Village, befriending and picking up material from folk singers there, including Dave Van\u00a0Ronk, Fred Neil, Odetta, the New Lost City Ramblers and Irish musicians the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem.[33] On April 11, Dylan commenced a two-week engagement at Gerde's Folk City, supporting John Lee Hooker.[34] New York Times critic Robert Shelton first considered Dylan in a review of Izzy Young's production for WRVR of a live twelve-hour Hootenanny on July 29, 1961: \"Among the newer promising talents deserving mention are a 20-year-old latter-day Guthrie disciple named Bob Dylan, with a curiously arresting mumbling, country-steeped manner.\" This was Dylan's first radio performance.[35] In September, Shelton boosted Dylan's career with an enthusiastic review of his performance at Gerde's Folk City.[36] That month, Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester's third album. This brought him to the attention of the album's producer, John Hammond,[37] who signed Dylan to Columbia Records.[38] Dylan's first album, Bob Dylan, released March 19, 1962,[39] consisted of familiar folk, blues and gospel with two original compositions. The album sold only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even.[40] Within Columbia Records, some referred to Dylan as \"Hammond's Folly\"[41] and suggested dropping his contract, but Hammond defended him and was supported by songwriter Johnny Cash.[40] In March 1962, Dylan contributed harmonica and backup vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen, accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records.[42] While working for Columbia, Dylan recorded under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt[43] for Broadside, a folk magazine and record label.[44] Dylan used the pseudonym Bob Landy to record as a piano player on The Blues Project, a 1964 anthology album by Elektra Records.[43] As Tedham Porterhouse, Dylan played harmonica on Ramblin' Jack Elliott's 1964 album Jack Elliott.[43] Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962: he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan,[45][46] and signed a management contract with Albert Grossman.[47] (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.)[48] Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was known for his sometimes confrontational personality and protective loyalty.[49] Dylan said, \"He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure\u00a0... you could smell him coming.\"[25] Tension between Grossman and John Hammond led to the latter suggesting Dylan work with the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson, who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit. Wilson produced the next three albums Dylan recorded.[50][51] Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963.[52] He had been invited by television director Philip Saville to appear in a drama, Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television.[53] At the end of the play, Dylan performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\", one of its first public performances.[53] The film recording of Madhouse on Castle Street was discarded by the BBC in 1968.[53] While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including the Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies.[52] He also learned material from UK performers, including Martin Carthy.[53] By the release of Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer-songwriter. Many songs on the album were labeled protest songs, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger's passion for topical songs.[54] \"Oxford Town\", for example, was an account of James Meredith's ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi.[55] The first song on the album, \"Blowin' in the Wind\", partly derived its melody from the traditional slave song, \"No More Auction Block\",[56] while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary.[57] Another song, \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", was based on the folk ballad \"Lord Randall\". With veiled references to an impending apocalypse, it gained resonance when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.[58][a 2] Like \"Blowin' in the Wind\", \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" marked a new direction in songwriting, blending a stream-of-consciousness, imagist lyrical attack with traditional folk form.[59] Dylan's topical songs led to his being viewed as more than just a songwriter. Janet Maslin wrote in 1980[60] of Freewheelin': \"These were the songs that established [Dylan] as the voice of his generation\u2014someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about nuclear disarmament and the growing Civil Rights Movement: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.\"[61][a 3] Freewheelin' also included love songs and surreal talking blues. Humor was an important part of Dylan's persona,[62] and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including the Beatles. George Harrison said of the album: \"We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude\u2014it was incredibly original and wonderful.\"[63] The rough edge of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some but an attraction to others. Novelist Joyce Carol Oates wrote: \"When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying.\"[64] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate and lover.[65] Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.[66][67] \"It didn't take long before people got it, that he was pretty damned special,\" says Baez.[68] Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included the Byrds, Sonny & Cher, the Hollies, Peter, Paul and Mary, the Association, Manfred Mann and the Turtles. Most attempted a pop feel and rhythm, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk songs. The covers became so ubiquitous that CBS promoted him with the slogan \"Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan\".[69] \"Mixed-Up Confusion\", recorded during the Freewheelin' sessions with a backing band, was released as a single but quickly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound. Cameron Crowe described it as \"a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records.\"[70] In May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\" was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.[71] By this time, Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.[72] Dylan's third album, The Times They Are a-Changin', reflected a more politicized Dylan.[73] The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with \"Only a Pawn in Their Game\" addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers; and the Brechtian \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.[74] On a more general theme, \"Ballad of Hollis Brown\" and \"North Country Blues\" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, \"Boots of Spanish Leather\" and \"One Too Many Mornings\".[75] By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.[76] Accepting the \"Tom Paine Award\" from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.[77] Another Side of Bob Dylan, recorded in a single evening on June 9, 1964,[78] had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on \"I Shall Be Free No.\u00a010\" and \"Motorpsycho Nightmare\". \"Spanish Harlem Incident\" and \"To Ramona\" are passionate love songs, while \"Black Crow Blues\" and \"I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)\" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. \"It Ain't Me Babe\", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him.[79] His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic \"Chimes of Freedom\", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as \"chains of flashing images,\"[80] and \"My Back Pages\", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.[81] In the latter half of 1964 and into 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to folk-rock pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed \"Beatle boots\". A London reporter wrote: \"Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo.\"[82] Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Appearing on the Les Crane television show and asked about a movie he planned, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, \"No, I play my mother.\"[83] Dylan's late March 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was another leap,[84] featuring his first recordings with electric instruments, under producer Tom Wilson's guidance.[85] The first single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", owed much to Chuck Berry's \"Too Much Monkey Business\";[86] its free association lyrics described as harking back to the energy of beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip-hop.[87] The song was provided with an early video, which opened D. A. Pennebaker's cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of Great Britain, Dont Look Back.[88] Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground. Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements.[89] The second side of Bringing It All Back Home contained four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.[90] \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" became one of his best-known songs when the Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK.[91][92] \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" and \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" were two of Dylan's most important compositions.[90][93] In 1965, headlining the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a pickup group featuring Mike Bloomfield on guitar and Al Kooper on organ.[94] Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. Murray Lerner, who filmed the performance, said: \"I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric.\"[95] An alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short set. This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival, who reports his recording proves the only boos were in reaction to the MC's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set.[96][97] Nevertheless, Dylan's performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.[98][99] In the September issue of Sing Out!, Ewan MacColl wrote: \"Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time\u00a0...'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers\u00a0... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel.\"[100] On July 29, four days after Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording \"Positively 4th Street\". The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia,[101] and it has been interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community\u2014friends he had known in clubs along West 4th Street.[102] In July 1965, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" peaked at number two in the U.S. chart. In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".[3][103] Bruce Springsteen, in his speech for Dylan's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that on first hearing the single, \"that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind.\"[104] The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.[105] The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. \"Desolation Row\", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass,[106] offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as \"an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical (Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse\".[107] In support of the album, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts with Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew and Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, former members of Ronnie Hawkins's backing band the Hawks.[108] On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound. The band's reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable.[109] From September 24, 1965, in Austin, Texas, Dylan toured the U.S. and Canada for six months, backed by the five musicians from the Hawks who became known as the Band.[110] While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences, their studio efforts floundered. Producer Bob Johnston persuaded Dylan to record in Nashville in February 1966, and surrounded him with top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions.[111] The Nashville sessions produced the double album Blonde on Blonde (1966), featuring what Dylan called \"that thin wild mercury sound\".[112] Kooper described it as \"taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion\": the musical world of Nashville and the world of the \"quintessential New York hipster\" Bob Dylan.[113] On November 22, 1965, Dylan quietly married 25-year-old former model Sara Lownds.[114] Robertson has described how he received a phone call that morning to accompany the couple to a courthouse on Long Island, and then to a reception hosted by Albert and Sally Grossman at the Algonquin Hotel.[115] Some of Dylan's friends, including Ramblin' Jack Elliott, say that, immediately after the event, Dylan denied he was married.[114] Journalist Nora Ephron made the news public in the New York Post in February 1966 with the headline \"Hush! Bob Dylan is wed.\"[116] Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each show was split in two. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. In the second, backed by the Hawks, he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slow handclapped.[117] The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17, 1966.[118] A recording of this concert was released in 1998: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: \"Judas!\" to which Dylan responded, \"I don't believe you\u00a0... You're a liar!\" Dylan turned to his band and said, \"Play it fucking loud!\"[119] as they launched into the final song of the night\u2014\"Like a Rolling Stone\". During his 1966 tour, Dylan was described as exhausted and acting \"as if on a death trip\".[120] D. A. Pennebaker, the filmmaker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as \"taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else\".[121] In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, \"I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things\u00a0... just to keep going, you know?\"[122] In 2011, BBC Radio 4 reported that, in an interview that Robert Shelton taped in 1966, Dylan said he had kicked heroin in New York City: \"I got very, very strung out for a while\u00a0... I had about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it.\"[123] Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had \"been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career\".[124][125] After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show.[126] His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck.[127] Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.[127][128] Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him.[127][129] Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\"[130] Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.[128][131] Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.[132] The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals.[133] In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \"Big Pink\".[134] These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for Julie Driscoll and the Brian Auger Trinity (\"This Wheel's on Fire\"), the Byrds (\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\", \"Nothing Was Delivered\"), and Manfred Mann (\"Mighty Quinn\"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as The Basement Tapes. Over the years, many more songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on bootleg recordings, culminating in the 2014 official Columbia release The Basement Tapes Complete which contained 138 songs and alternate takes.[135] In the coming months, the Hawks recorded the album Music from Big Pink using songs they worked on in their basement in Woodstock, and renamed themselves the Band,[136] beginning a long recording and performing career of their own. In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to Nashville.[137] Back in the studio after 19 months, he was accompanied by Charlie McCoy on bass,[137] Kenny Buttrey on drums,[137] and Pete Drake on steel guitar.[137] The result was John Wesley Harding, a contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on the American West and the Bible. The sparse structure and instrumentation, with lyrics that took the Judeo-Christian tradition seriously, departed from Dylan's own work and from the psychedelic fervor of the 1960s.[138] It included \"All Along the Watchtower\", with lyrics derived from the Book of Isaiah (21:5\u20139). The song was later recorded by Jimi Hendrix, whose version Dylan acknowledged as definitive.[23] Woody Guthrie died on October 3, 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at Carnegie Hall on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by the Band.[139] Dylan's next release, Nashville Skyline (1969), was mainstream country featuring Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with Johnny Cash, and the hit single \"Lay Lady Lay\".[141] Variety wrote, \"Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range.\"[142] During one recording session, Dylan and Cash recorded a series of duets but only their version of Dylan's \"Girl from the North Country\" was released on the album.[143][144] In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of Johnny Cash's television show and sang a duet with Cash of \"Girl from the North Country\", with solos of \"Living the Blues\" and \"I Threw It All Away.\"[145] Dylan next traveled to England to top the bill at the Isle of Wight festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the Woodstock Festival closer to his home.[146] In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable. Rolling Stone writer Greil Marcus asked \"What is this shit?\" on first listening to Self Portrait, released in June 1970.[147][148] It was a double LP including few original songs, and was poorly received.[149] In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, considered a return to form.[150] This album included \"Day of the Locusts\", a song in which Dylan gave an account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970.[151] In November 1968, Dylan had co-written \"I'd Have You Anytime\" with George Harrison;[152] Harrison recorded \"I'd Have You Anytime\" and Dylan's \"If Not for You\" for his 1970 solo triple album All Things Must Pass. Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh attracted media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.[153] Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock, a small studio in Greenwich Village, to record with Leon Russell. These sessions resulted in \"Watching the River Flow\" and a new recording of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\".[154] On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded \"George Jackson\", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin State Prison that year.[155] Dylan contributed piano and harmony to Steve Goodman's album, Somebody Else's Troubles, under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas (referencing Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas and his own previous name) in September 1972.[156] In 1972, Dylan signed to Sam Peckinpah's film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, providing songs and backing music for the movie, and playing \"Alias\", a member of Billy's gang with some historical basis.[157] Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" became one of Dylan's most covered songs.[158][159] Also in 1972, Dylan protested the move to deport John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who had been convicted of possessing cannabis, by sending a letter to the U.S. Immigration Service, in part: \"Hurray for John & Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country's got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!\"[160] Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records when his contract with Columbia Records expired.[162] His next album, Planet Waves, was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour.[163] The album included two versions of \"Forever Young\", which became one of his most popular songs.[164] As one critic described it, the song projected \"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\",[165] and Dylan himself commented: \"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\"[23] Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes, widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.[166] In January 1974, Dylan, backed by the Band, embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts\u2014his first tour for seven years. A live double album, Before the Flood, was released on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold.\"[167] Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, unhappy that Geffen had sold only 600,000 copies of Planet Waves despite millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour;[168] he returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums.[169] After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974.[170] Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.[171] Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\"[172] In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\"[172] Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements. For the Salon website, journalist Bill Wyman wrote: \"Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.\"[173] Novelist Rick Moody called it \"the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape.\"[174] In the middle of that year, Dylan wrote a ballad championing boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, imprisoned for a triple murder in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1966. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote \"Hurricane\", presenting the case for Carter's innocence. Despite its length\u2014over eight minutes\u2014the song was released as a single, peaking at 33 on the U.S. Billboard chart, and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue.[a 4][175] The tour featured about one hundred performers and supporters from the Greenwich Village folk scene, including T-Bone Burnett, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Joni Mitchell,[176][177] David Mansfield, Roger McGuinn, Mick Ronson, Joan Baez, and Scarlet Rivera, whom Dylan discovered walking down the street, her violin case on her back.[178] Allen Ginsberg accompanied the troupe, staging scenes for the film Dylan was shooting. Sam Shepard was hired to write the screenplay, but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler.[179] Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album Desire, with many of Dylan's new songs featuring a travelogue-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright Jacques Levy.[180][181] The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, Hard Rain, and the LP Hard Rain; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002's Live 1975.[182] A documentary of the 1975 leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue, Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese was released by Netflix on June 12, 2019, with a fourteen-CD box set of rehearsals and five complete recordings of Dylan's performances from the Revue released on June 7, 2019, as The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings. The documentary features participants interviewed by Jeff Rosen over decades and it was assembled by Martin Scorsese and editor David Tedeschi.[183] The 1975 tour with the Revue provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film Renaldo and Clara, a sprawling narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences. Released in 1978, the movie received poor, sometimes scathing, reviews.[184][185] Later in that year, a two-hour edit, dominated by the concert performances, was more widely released.[186] In November 1976, Dylan appeared at the Band's \"farewell\" concert, with Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Van Morrison and Neil Young. Martin Scorsese's cinematic chronicle, The Last Waltz, in 1978 included about half of Dylan's set.[187] In 1976, Dylan wrote and duetted on \"Sign Language\" for Eric Clapton's No Reason To Cry.[188] In 1978, Dylan embarked on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million. Dylan assembled an eight-piece band and three backing singers. Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were released as the live double album, Bob Dylan At Budokan.[189] Reviews were mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, giving the album a derisory review,[190] while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing: \"These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals.\"[191] When Dylan brought the tour to the U.S. in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a 'Las Vegas Tour'.[192] The 1978 tour grossed more than $20\u00a0million, and Dylan told the Los Angeles Times that he had debts because \"I had a couple of bad years. I put a lot of money into the movie, built a big house \u00a0... and it costs a lot to get divorced in California.\"[189] In April and May 1978, Dylan took the same band and vocalists into Rundown Studios in Santa Monica, California, to record an album of new material: Street-Legal.[193] It was described by Michael Gray as, \"after Blood On The Tracks, arguably Dylan's best record of the 1970s: a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan's own life.\"[194] However, it had poor sound and mixing (attributed to Dylan's studio practices), muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs' strengths.[195] In the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Evangelical Christianity,[196][197] undertaking a three-month discipleship course run by the Association of Vineyard Churches;[198][199] and released two albums of contemporary gospel music. Slow Train Coming (1979) featured the guitar accompaniment of Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits) and was produced by veteran R&B producer Jerry Wexler. Wexler said that Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording. He replied: \"Bob, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album.\"[200] Dylan won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song \"Gotta Serve Somebody.\" His second Christian-themed album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as \"the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior\"[201] When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as: Years ago they\u00a0... said I was a prophet. I used to say, \"No I'm not a prophet\" they say \"Yes you are, you're a prophet.\" I said, \"No it's not me.\" They used to say \"You sure are a prophet.\" They used to convince me I was a prophet. Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer. They say, \"Bob Dylan's no prophet.\" They just can't handle it.[202] Dylan's Christianity was unpopular with some fans and musicians.[203] Shortly before his murder, John Lennon recorded \"Serve Yourself\" in response to Dylan's \"Gotta Serve Somebody.\"[204] By 1981, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times that \"neither age (he's now 40) nor his much-publicized conversion to born-again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament.\"[205] In late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as \"A Musical Retrospective\", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. Shot of Love, recorded early the next year, featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs. \"Every Grain of Sand\" reminded some of William Blake's verses.[206] In the 1980s, reception of Dylan's recordings varied, from the well-regarded Infidels in 1983 to the panned Down in the Groove in 1988. Michael Gray condemned Dylan's 1980s albums for carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.[207] As an example of the latter, the Infidels recording sessions, which again employed Knopfler on lead guitar and also as the album's producer, resulted in several notable songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were \"Blind Willie McTell\", a tribute to the dead blues musician and an evocation of African American history,[208] \"Foot of Pride\" and \"Lord Protect My Child.\" These three songs were released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991.[209] Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded Empire Burlesque.[210] Arthur Baker, who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper, was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound \"a little bit more contemporary.\"[210] In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single \"We Are the World.\" He also joined Artists United Against Apartheid providing vocals for their single \"Sun City.\"[211] On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of \"Hollis Brown\", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: \"I hope that some of the money\u00a0... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe\u00a0... one or two million, maybe\u00a0... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks.\"[212] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.[213] In April 1986, Dylan made a foray into rap music when he added vocals to the opening verse of \"Street Rock\", featured on Kurtis Blow's album Kingdom Blow.[214] Dylan's next studio album, Knocked Out Loaded, in July 1986 contained three covers (by Little Junior Parker, Kris Kristofferson and the gospel hymn \"Precious Memories\"), plus three collaborations (with Tom Petty, Sam Shepard and Carole Bayer Sager), and two solo compositions by Dylan. One reviewer commented that \"the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating.\"[215] It was the first Dylan album since Freewheelin' (1963) to fail to make the Top 50.[216] Since then, some critics have called the 11-minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, \"Brownsville Girl\", a work of genius.[217] In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with the Grateful Dead in 1987, resulting in a live album Dylan & The Dead. This received negative reviews; AllMusic said it was \"Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead.\"[218] Dylan then initiated what came to be called the Never Ending Tour on June 7, 1988, performing with a back-up band featuring guitarist G. E. Smith. Dylan would continue to tour with a small, changing band for the next 30 years.[219] In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett.[220] Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack\u2014\"Night After Night\", and \"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \"The Usual.\" The film was a critical and commercial flop.[221] Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\"[222] The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album.[223] Michael Gray wrote: \"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\"[224] The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart,[223] featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.[225] Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.[226] Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\"[224][227] The track \"Most of the Time\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \"What Was It You Wanted?\" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.[228] The religious imagery of \"Ring Them Bells\" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.[229] Dylan's 1990s began with Under the Red Sky (1990), an about-face from the serious Oh Mercy. The album contained several apparently simple songs, including \"Under the Red Sky\" and \"Wiggle Wiggle.\" The album was dedicated to \"Gabby Goo Goo\", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four.[230] Sidemen on the album included George Harrison, Slash from Guns N' Roses, David Crosby, Bruce Hornsby, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Elton John. Despite the line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.[231] In 1991, Dylan received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson.[232] The event coincided with the start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, and Dylan performed \"Masters of War.\" Dylan then made a short speech, saying \"My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.'\"[232][233] This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.[234] Over the next few years Dylan returned to his roots with two albums covering traditional folk and blues songs: Good as I Been to You (1992) and World Gone Wrong (1993), backed solely by his acoustic guitar.[235] Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song \"Lone Pilgrim\",[236] written by a 19th-century teacher. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on hits.[237] The album from it, MTV Unplugged, included \"John Brown\", an unreleased 1962 song of how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.[238] With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch,[239] Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.[240] Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, \"I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon.\"[241] He was back on the road by mid-year, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric \"Blowin' in the Wind.\"[242] In September Dylan released the new Lanois-produced album, Time Out of Mind. With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. One critic wrote: \"the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years.\"[243] This collection of complex songs won him his first solo \"Album of the Year\" Grammy Award.[244] In December 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton presented Dylan with a Kennedy Center Honor in the East Room of the White House, paying this tribute: \"He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful.\"[245] Dylan commenced the 2000s by winning the Polar Music Prize in May 2000 and his first Oscar; his song \"Things Have Changed\", written for the film Wonder Boys, won an Academy Award in March 2001.[247] The Oscar, by some reports a facsimile, tours with him, presiding over shows perched atop an amplifier.[248] \"Love and Theft\" was released on September 11, 2001. Recorded with his touring band, Dylan produced the album himself under the pseudonym Jack Frost.[249] The album was critically well received and earned nominations for several Grammy awards.[250] Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly, Western swing, jazz, and even lounge ballads.[251] \"Love and Theft\" generated controversy when The Wall Street Journal pointed out similarities between the album's lyrics and Japanese author Junichi Saga's book Confessions of a Yakuza.[252][253] In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his Christian period and participated in the CD project Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan. That year Dylan also released the film Masked & Anonymous, which he co-wrote with director Larry Charles under the alias Sergei Petrov.[254] Dylan played the central character in the film, Jack Fate, alongside a cast that included Jeff Bridges, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and John Goodman. The film polarised critics: many dismissed it as an \"incoherent mess\";[255][256] a few treated it as a serious work of art.[257][258] In October 2004, Dylan published the first part of his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One. Confounding expectations,[259] Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961\u20131962, virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height. He also devoted chapters to the albums New Morning (1970) and Oh Mercy (1989). The book reached number two on The New York Times' Hardcover Non-Fiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a National Book Award.[260] No Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's acclaimed film biography of Dylan,[261] was first broadcast on September 26\u201327, 2005, on BBC Two in the UK and PBS in the US.[262] The documentary focuses on the period from Dylan's arrival in New York in 1961 to his motorcycle crash in 1966, featuring interviews with Suze Rotolo, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Pete Seeger, Mavis Staples, and Dylan himself. The film received a Peabody Award in April 2006[263] and a Columbia-duPont Award in January 2007.[264] The accompanying soundtrack featured unreleased songs from Dylan's early career.[265] Dylan earned another distinction when a 2007 study of US legal opinions found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers more than those of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by the Beatles, who were second. Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, both conservatives. The most widely cited lines included \"you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows\" from \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" and \"when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose\" from \"Like a Rolling Stone.\"[266][267] Dylan's career as a radio presenter commenced on May 3, 2006, with his weekly radio program, Theme Time Radio Hour for XM Satellite Radio, with song selections revolving around chosen themes.[268][269] Dylan played classic and obscure records from the 1920s to the present day, including contemporary artists as diverse as Blur, Prince, L.L. Cool J and the Streets. The show was praised by fans and critics as \"great radio,\" as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references, commenting on his musical choices.[270][271] In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was \"Goodbye\" and the final record played was Woody Guthrie's \"So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh.\"[272] Dylan released his Modern Times album in August 2006. Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for The Guardian characterised his singing on the album as \"a catarrhal death rattle\"[273]) most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, embracing Time Out of Mind and \"Love and Theft\".[274] Modern Times entered the U.S. charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire.[275] The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in Modern Times and the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.[276] Nominated for three Grammy Awards, Modern Times won Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album and Bob Dylan also won Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for \"Someday Baby.\" Modern Times was named Album of the Year, 2006, by Rolling Stone magazine,[277] and by Uncut in the UK.[278] On the same day that Modern Times was released the iTunes Music Store released Bob Dylan: The Collection, a digital box set containing all of his albums (773 tracks in total), along with 42 rare and unreleased tracks.[279] In August 2007, the award-winning film biography of Dylan I'm Not There, written and directed by Todd Haynes, was released\u2014bearing the tagline \"inspired by the music and many lives of Bob Dylan.\"[280][281] The movie used six different actors to represent different aspects of Dylan's life: Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger and Ben Whishaw.[281][282] Dylan's previously unreleased 1967 recording from which the film takes its name[283] was released for the first time on the film's original soundtrack; all other tracks are covers of Dylan songs, specially recorded for the movie by a diverse range of artists, including Sonic Youth, Eddie Vedder, Mason Jennings, Stephen Malkmus, Jeff Tweedy, Karen O, Willie Nelson, Cat Power, Richie Havens, and Tom Verlaine.[284] On October 1, 2007, Columbia Records released the triple CD retrospective album Dylan, anthologising his entire career under the Dylan 07 logo.[285] The sophistication of the Dylan 07 marketing campaign was a reminder that Dylan's commercial profile had risen considerably since the 1990s. This became evident in 2004, when Dylan appeared in a TV advertisement for Victoria's Secret lingerie.[286] Three years later, in October 2007, he participated in a multi-media campaign for the 2008 Cadillac Escalade.[287][288] Then, in 2009, he gave the highest profile endorsement of his career, appearing with rapper will.i.am in a Pepsi ad that debuted during the telecast of Super Bowl XLIII.[289] The ad, broadcast to a record audience of 98 million viewers, opened with Dylan singing the first verse of \"Forever Young\" followed by will.i.am doing a hip hop version of the song's third and final verse.[290] The Bootleg Series Vol. 8\u00a0\u2013 Tell Tale Signs was released in October 2008, as both a two-CD set and a three-CD version with a 150-page hardcover book. The set contains live performances and outtakes from selected studio albums from Oh Mercy to Modern Times, as well as soundtrack contributions and collaborations with David Bromberg and Ralph Stanley.[291] The pricing of the album\u2014the two-CD set went on sale for $18.99 and the three-CD version for $129.99\u2014led to complaints about \"rip-off packaging\" from some fans and commentators.[292][293] The release was widely acclaimed by critics.[294] The abundance of alternative takes and unreleased material suggested to one reviewer that this volume of old outtakes \"feels like a new Bob Dylan record, not only for the astonishing freshness of the material, but also for the incredible sound quality and organic feeling of everything here.\"[295] Bob Dylan released his album Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song; initially only intending to record a single track, \"Life Is Hard,\" \"the record sort of took its own direction.\"[296] Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter.[297] The album received largely favorable reviews,[298] although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work.[299] In its first week of release, the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S.,[300] making Bob Dylan (67 years of age) the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart.[300] It also reached number one on the UK album chart, 39 years after Dylan's previous UK album chart topper New Morning. This meant that Dylan currently holds the record for the longest gap between solo number one albums in the UK chart.[301] Dylan's album, Christmas in the Heart, was released in October 2009, comprising such Christmas standards as \"Little Drummer Boy\", \"Winter Wonderland\" and \"Here Comes Santa Claus.\"[302] Critics pointed out that Dylan was \"revisiting yuletide styles popularized by Nat King Cole, Mel Torm\u00e9, and the Ray Conniff Singers.\"[303] Dylan's royalties from the sale of this album were donated to the charities Feeding America in the USA, Crisis in the UK, and the World Food Programme.[304] The album received generally favorable reviews.[305] The New Yorker wrote that Dylan had welded a pre-rock musical sound to \"some of his croakiest vocals in a while\", and speculated that his intentions might be ironic: \"Dylan has a long and highly publicized history with Christianity; to claim there's not a wink in the childish optimism of 'Here Comes Santa Claus' or 'Winter Wonderland' is to ignore a half-century of biting satire.\"[306] In an interview published in The Big Issue, journalist Bill Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style, and Dylan responded: \"There wasn't any other way to play it. These songs are part of my life, just like folk songs. You have to play them straight too.\"[307] Volume 9 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, The Witmark Demos was issued in October 18, 2010. It comprised 47 demo recordings of songs taped between 1962 and 1964 for Dylan's earliest music publishers: Leeds Music in 1962, and Witmark Music from 1962 to 1964. One reviewer described the set as \"a hearty glimpse of young Bob Dylan changing the music business, and the world, one note at a time.\"[308] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a Metascore of 86, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[309] In the same week, Sony Legacy released Bob Dylan: The Original Mono Recordings, a box set that for the first time presented Dylan's eight earliest albums, from Bob Dylan (1962) to John Wesley Harding (1967), in their original mono mix in the CD format. The CDs were housed in miniature facsimiles of the original album covers, replete with original liner notes. The set was accompanied by a booklet featuring an essay by music critic Greil Marcus.[310][311] On April 12, 2011, Legacy Recordings released Bob Dylan in Concert\u00a0\u2013 Brandeis University 1963, taped at Brandeis University on May 10, 1963, two weeks prior to the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. The tape was discovered in the archive of music writer Ralph J. Gleason, and the recording carries liner notes by Michael Gray, who says it captures Dylan \"from way back when Kennedy was President and the Beatles hadn't yet reached America. It reveals him not at any Big Moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period... This is the last live performance we have of Bob Dylan before he becomes a star.\"[312] The extent to which his work was studied at an academic level was demonstrated on Dylan's 70th birthday on May 24, 2011, when three universities organized symposia on his work. The University of Mainz,[313] the University of Vienna,[314] and the University of Bristol[315] invited literary critics and cultural historians to give papers on aspects of Dylan's work. Other events, including tribute bands, discussions and simple singalongs, took place around the world, as reported in The Guardian: \"From Moscow to Madrid, Norway to Northampton and Malaysia to his home state of Minnesota, self-confessed 'Bobcats' will gather today to celebrate the 70th birthday of a giant of popular music.\"[316] On May 29, 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Dylan a Presidential Medal of Freedom in the White House. At the ceremony, Obama praised Dylan's voice for its \"unique gravelly power that redefined not just what music sounded like but the message it carried and how it made people feel.\"[317] Dylan's 35th studio album, Tempest was released on September 11, 2012.[318] The album features a tribute to John Lennon, \"Roll On John\", and the title track is a 14-minute song about the sinking of the Titanic.[319] Reviewing Tempest for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes gave the album five out of five stars, writing: \"Lyrically, Dylan is at the top of his game, joking around, dropping wordplay and allegories that evade pat readings and quoting other folks' words like a freestyle rapper on fire.\"[320] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a score of 83 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[321] Volume 10 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, Another Self Portrait (1969\u20131971) was released in August 2013.[322] The album contained 35 previously unreleased tracks, including alternative takes and demos from Dylan's 1969\u20131971 recording sessions during the making of the Self Portrait and New Morning albums. The box set also included a live recording of Dylan's performance with the Band at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969. Another Self Portrait received favorable reviews, earning a score of 81 on the critical aggregator, Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[323] AllMusic critic Thom Jurek wrote, \"For fans, this is more than a curiosity, it's an indispensable addition to the catalog.\"[324] Columbia Records released a boxed set containing all 35 Dylan studio albums, six albums of live recordings, and a collection, entitled Sidetracks, of non-album material, Bob Dylan: Complete Album Collection: Vol. One, in November 2013..[325][326] To publicize the 35 album box set, an innovative video of the song \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was released on Dylan's website. The interactive video, created by director Vania Heymann, allowed viewers to switch between 16 simulated TV channels, all featuring characters who are lip-synching the lyrics of the 48-year-old song.[327][328] Dylan appeared in a commercial for the Chrysler 200 car which was screened during the 2014 Super Bowl American football game played on February 2, 2014. At the end of the commercial, Dylan says: \"So let Germany brew your beer, let Switzerland make your watch, let Asia assemble your phone. We will build your car.\" Dylan's Super Bowl commercial generated controversy and op-ed pieces discussing the protectionist implications of his words, and whether the singer had \"sold out\" to corporate interests.[329][330][331][332][333] In 2013 and 2014, auction house sales demonstrated the high cultural value attached to Dylan's mid-1960s work and the record prices that collectors were willing to pay for artefacts from this period. In December 2013, the Fender Stratocaster which Dylan had played at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival fetched $965,000, the second highest price paid for a guitar.[334][335] In June 2014, Dylan's hand-written lyrics of \"Like a Rolling Stone\", his 1965 hit single, fetched $2 million dollars at auction, a record for a popular music manuscript.[336][337] A massive 960 page, thirteen and a half pound edition of Dylan's lyrics, The Lyrics: Since 1962 was published by Simon & Schuster in the fall of 2014. The book was edited by literary critic Christopher Ricks, Julie Nemrow and Lisa Nemrow, to offer variant versions of Dylan's songs, sourced from out-takes and live performances. A limited edition of 50 books, signed by Dylan, was priced at $5,000. \"It's the biggest, most expensive book we've ever published, as far as I know,\" said Jonathan Karp, Simon & Schuster's president and publisher.[338][339] A comprehensive edition of the Basement Tapes song recorded by Dylan and the Band in 1967 was released as The Basement Tapes Complete in November 2014. These 138 tracks in a six-CD box form Volume 11 of Dylan's Bootleg Series. The 1975 album, The Basement Tapes, had contained just 24 tracks from the material which Dylan and the Band had recorded at their homes in Woodstock, New York in 1967. Subsequently, over 100 recordings and alternate takes had circulated on bootleg records. The sleeve notes for the new box set are by Sid Griffin, author of Million Dollar Bash: Bob Dylan, the Band, and the Basement Tapes.[340][341] In February 2015, Dylan released Shadows in the Night, featuring ten songs written between 1923 and 1963,[342][343] which have been described as part of the Great American Songbook.[344] All the songs on the album were recorded by Frank Sinatra but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of \"Sinatra covers.\"[342][345] Dylan explained, \"I don't see myself as covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day.\"[346] In an interview, Dylan said he had been thinking about making this record since hearing Willie Nelson's 1978 album Stardust.[347] Dylan's first foray into this material was in 2001 when he recorded Dean Martin's \"Return to Me\" for the third season of The Sopranos.[348] Shadows In the Night received favorable reviews, scoring 82 on the critical aggregator Metacritic, which indicates \"universal acclaim\".[349] Critics praised the restrained instrumental backings and the quality of Dylan's singing.[344][350] Bill Prince in GQ commented: \"A performer who's had to hear his influence in virtually every white pop recording made since he debuted his own self-titled album back in 1962 imagines himself into the songs of his pre-rock'n'roll early youth.\"[345] The album debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release.[351] The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965\u20131966, consisting of previously unreleased material from the three albums Dylan recorded between January 1965 and March 1966: Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde was released in November 2015. The set was released in three formats: a 2-CD \"Best Of\" version, a 6-CD \"Deluxe edition\", and an 18-CD \"Collector's Edition\" in a limited edition of 5,000 units. On Dylan's website the \"Collector's Edition\" was described as containing \"every single note recorded by Bob Dylan in the studio in 1965/1966.\"[352][353] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded Cutting Edge a score of 99, indicating universal acclaim.[354] The Best of the Cutting Edge entered the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart at number one on November 18, based on its first-week sales.[355] The sale of Dylan's extensive archive of about 6,000 items of memorabilia to the George Kaiser Family Foundation and the University of Tulsa was announced on March 2, 2016. It was reported the sale price was \"an estimated $15 million to $20 million\". The archive comprises notebooks, drafts of Dylan lyrics, recordings, and correspondence.[356] The archive will be housed at Helmerich Center for American Research, a facility at the Gilcrease Museum.[357] Dylan released Fallen Angels\u2014described as \"a direct continuation of the work of 'uncovering' the Great Songbook that he began on last year's Shadows In the Night\"\u2014in May.[358] The album contained twelve songs by classic songwriters such as Harold Arlen, Sammy Cahn and Johnny Mercer, eleven of which had been recorded by Sinatra.[358] Jim Farber wrote in Entertainment Weekly: \"Tellingly, [Dylan] delivers these songs of love lost and cherished not with a burning passion but with the wistfulness of experience. They're memory songs now, intoned with a present sense of commitment. Released just four days ahead of his 75th birthday, they couldn't be more age-appropriate.\"[359] The album received a score of 79 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, denoting \"generally favorable reviews\".[360] A massive 36-CD collection, The 1966 Live Recordings, including every known recording of Bob Dylan's 1966 concert tour was released in November 2016.[361] The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the Royal Albert Hall concert in London on May 27.[362][363] The New York Times reported most of the concerts had \"never been heard in any form\", and described the set as \"a monumental addition to the corpus\".[364] Dylan released a triple album of a further 30 recordings of classic American songs, Triplicate, in March 2017. Dylan's 38th studio album was recorded in Hollywood's Capitol Studios and features his touring band.[365] Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. \"Nostalgic? No I wouldn't say that. It's not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for the good old days or fond memories of what's no more. A song like \"Sentimental Journey\" is not a way back when song, it doesn't emulate the past, it's attainable and down to earth, it's in the here and now.\"[366] The album was awarded a score of 84 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, signifying \"universal acclaim\". Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the great American songbook, though, in the opinion of Uncut: \"For all its easy charms, Triplicate labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums' worth of croon toons, this feels like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter.\"[367] The next edition of Dylan's Bootleg Series revisited Dylan's \"Born Again\" Christian period of 1979 to 1981, which was described by Rolling Stone as \"an intense, wildly controversial time that produced three albums and some of the most confrontational concerts of his long career\".[368] Reviewing the box set, The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979\u20131981, comprising 8 CDs and 1 DVD.[368] in The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote, \"Decades later, what comes through these recordings above all is Mr. Dylan's unmistakable fervor, his sense of mission. The studio albums are subdued, even tentative, compared with what the songs became on the road. Mr. Dylan's voice is clear, cutting and ever improvisational; working the crowds, he was emphatic, committed, sometimes teasingly combative. And the band tears into the music.\"[369] Trouble No More includes a DVD of a film directed by Jennifer Lebeau consisting of live footage of Dylan's gospel performances interspersed with sermons delivered by actor Michael Shannon. The box set album received an aggregate score of 84 on the critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[370] Dylan made a contribution to the compilation EP Universal Love, a collection of reimagined wedding songs for the LGBT community in April 2018.[371] The album was funded by MGM Resorts International and the songs are intended to function as \"wedding anthems for same-sex couples\".[372] Dylan recorded the 1929 song \"She's Funny That Way\", changing the gender pronoun to \"He's Funny That Way\". The song has previously been recorded by Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra.[372][373] Also in April 2018, The New York Times announced that Dylan was launching Heaven's Door, a range of three whiskeys: a straight rye, a straight bourbon and a \"double-barreled\" whiskey. Dylan has been involved in both the creation and the marketing of the range. The Times described the venture as \"Mr. Dylan's entry into the booming celebrity-branded spirits market, the latest career twist for an artist who has spent five decades confounding expectations.\"[374] On November 2, 2018, Dylan released More Blood, More Tracks as Volume 14 in the Bootleg Series. The set comprises all Dylan's recordings for his 1975 album Blood On the Tracks, and was issued as a single CD and also as a six-CD Deluxe Edition.[375] The box set album received an aggregate score of 93 on the critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[376] Netflix released the movie Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese on June 12, 2019, describing the film as \"Part documentary, part concert film, part fever dream\".[377][183] The Scorsese film received an aggregate score of 88 on critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[378] The film sparked controversy because of the way it deliberately mixed documentary footage filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue in the fall of 1975 with fictitious characters and invented stories.[379] Coinciding with the film release, a box set of 14 CDs, The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings, was released by Columbia Records. The set comprises five full Dylan performances from the tour and recently discovered tapes from Dylan's tour rehearsals.[380] The box set received an aggregate score of 89 on the critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[381] The next instalment of Dylan's Bootleg Series, Bob Dylan (featuring Johnny Cash) \u2013 Travelin\u2019 Thru, 1967 \u2013 1969: The Bootleg Series Vol. 15, was released on November 1. The 3-CD set comprises outtakes from Dylan's albums John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline, and songs that Dylan recorded with Johnny Cash in Nashville in 1969 and with Earl Scruggs in 1970.[382][383] Travelin' Thru received an aggregate score of 88 on the critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[384] The Never Ending Tour commenced on June 7, 1988,[385] and Dylan has played roughly 100 dates a year for the entirety of the 1990s and 2000s\u2014a heavier schedule than most performers who started out in the 1960s.[386] By April 2019, Dylan and his band had played more than 3,000 shows,[387] anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier, multi-instrumentalist Donnie Herron and guitarist Charlie Sexton.[388] In October 2019, drummer Matt Chamberlain joined the band.[388] To the dismay of some of his audience,[389] Dylan's performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach night after night.[390] Critical opinion about Dylan's shows remains divided. Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material.[391][392] Others have criticized his live performances for mangling and spitting out \"the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable\", and giving so little to the audience that \"it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all.\"[393] Dylan's performances in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised him for not making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list.[394][395] Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed.[396][397] In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: \"As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for the names of the songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play.\"[398] In 2019, Dylan undertook two tours in Europe. The first commenced in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, on March 31, and ended in Valencia, Spain, on May 7. He played his 3000th show of the Never Ending Tour on April 19, 2019, in Innsbruck, Austria.[399] Dylan's second tour began in Bergen, Norway, on June 21, and ended in Kilkenny, Ireland, on July 14.[400][401] In the fall of 2019 Dylan toured the USA, commencing in Irvine, California on October 11 and ending in Washington D.C. on December 8.[402] In October 2019, Dylan's touring company indicated that he would play 14 concerts in Japan in April 2020.[403] The cover of Dylan's album Self Portrait (1970) is a reproduction of a painting of a face by Dylan.[404] Another of his paintings is reproduced on the cover of the 1974 album Planet Waves. In 1994 Random House published Drawn Blank, a book of Dylan's drawings.[405] In 2007, the first public exhibition of Dylan's paintings, The Drawn Blank Series, opened at the Kunstsammlungen in Chemnitz, Germany;[406] it showcased more than 200 watercolors and gouaches made from the original drawings. The exhibition coincided with the publication of Bob Dylan: The Drawn Blank Series, which includes 170 reproductions from the series.[406][407] From September 2010 until April 2011, the National Gallery of Denmark exhibited 40 large-scale acrylic paintings by Dylan, The Brazil Series.[408] In July 2011, a leading contemporary art gallery, Gagosian Gallery, announced their representation of Dylan's paintings.[409] An exhibition of Dylan's art, The Asia Series, opened at the Gagosian Madison Avenue Gallery on September 20, displaying Dylan's paintings of scenes in China and the Far East.[410] The New York Times reported that \"some fans and Dylanologists have raised questions about whether some of these paintings are based on the singer's own experiences and observations, or on photographs that are widely available and were not taken by Mr. Dylan.\" The Times pointed to close resemblances between Dylan's paintings and historic photos of Japan and China, and photos taken by Dmitri Kessel and Henri Cartier-Bresson.[411] Art critic Blake Gopnik has defended Dylan's artistic practice, arguing: \"Ever since the birth of photography, painters have used it as the basis for their works: Edgar Degas and Edouard Vuillard and other favorite artists\u2014even Edvard Munch\u2014all took or used photos as sources for their art, sometimes barely altering them.\"[412] The Magnum photo agency confirmed that Dylan had licensed the reproduction rights of these photographs.[413] Dylan's second show at the Gagosian Gallery, Revisionist Art, opened in November 2012. The show consisted of thirty paintings, transforming and satirizing popular magazines, including Playboy and Babytalk.[414][415] In February 2013, Dylan exhibited the New Orleans Series of paintings at the Palazzo Reale in Milan.[416] In August 2013, Britain's National Portrait Gallery in London hosted Dylan's first major UK exhibition, Face Value, featuring twelve pastel portraits.[417] In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an exhibition in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement released by the gallery, Dylan said, \"I've been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference.\"[418][419] In November 2016, the Halcyon Gallery featured a collection of drawings, watercolors and acrylic works by Dylan. The exhibition, The Beaten Path, depicted American landscapes and urban scenes, inspired by Dylan's travels across the USA.[420] The show was reviewed by Vanity Fair and Asia Times Online.[421][422][423] In October 2018, the Halcyon Gallery mounted an exhibition of Dylan's drawings, Mondo Scripto. The works consisted of Dylan hand-written lyrics of his songs, with each song illustrated by a drawing.[424] Since 1994, Dylan has published eight books of paintings and drawings.[425] Dylan has published Tarantula, a work of prose poetry; Chronicles: Volume One, the first part of his memoirs; several books of the lyrics of his songs, and eight books of his art. He has also been the subject of numerous biographies and critical studies. Dylan's first serious relationship was with artist Suze Rotolo, a daughter of American Communist Party radicals. According to Dylan, \"She was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen... The air was suddenly filled with banana leaves. We started talking and my head started to spin.\"[426] Rotolo was photographed arm-in-arm with Dylan on the cover of his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Critics have connected Rotolo to some of Dylan's early love songs, including \"Don't Think Twice It's All Right.\" The relationship ended in 1964.[427] In 2008, Rotolo published a memoir about her life in Greenwich Village and relationship with Dylan in the 1960s, A Freewheelin' Time.[428] When Joan Baez first met Dylan in April 1961, she had already released her first album and was acclaimed as the \"Queen of Folk.\"[429] On hearing Dylan perform his song \"With God on Our Side,\" Baez later said, \"I never thought anything so powerful could come out of that little toad.\"[430] In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets over the next two years.[431] By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the U.K, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back.[431] Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975\u201376, and sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue. Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special Hard Rain, filmed at Fort Collins, Colorado, in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman In White' in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 with Carlos Santana.[431] Baez recalled her relationship with Dylan in Martin Scorsese's documentary film No Direction Home (2005). Baez wrote about Dylan in two autobiographies\u2014admiringly in Daybreak (1968), and less admiringly in And A Voice to Sing With (1987). Baez's relationship with Dylan is the subject of her song \"Diamonds & Rust\", which has been described as \"an acute portrait\" of Dylan.[431] Dylan married Sara Lownds, who had worked as a model and a secretary to Drew Associates, on November 22, 1965.[432] Their first child, Jesse Byron Dylan, was born on January 6, 1966, and they had three more children: Anna Lea (born July 11, 1967), Samuel Isaac Abram (born July 30, 1968), and Jakob Luke (born December 9, 1969). Dylan also adopted Sara's daughter from a prior marriage, Maria Lownds (later Dylan, born October 21, 1961). Sara Dylan played the role of Clara in Dylan's film Renaldo and Clara (1978). Bob and Sara Dylan were divorced on June 29, 1977.[432] Maria married musician Peter Himmelman in 1988.[433] Jakob became well known as the lead singer of the band the Wallflowers in the 1990s.[434] Jesse is a film director and business executive.[435] Dylan married his backup singer Carolyn Dennis (often professionally known as Carol Dennis) on June 4, 1986. Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, their daughter, was born on January 31, 1986.[436] The couple divorced in October 1992. Their marriage and child remained a closely guarded secret until the publication of Howard Sounes' biography Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan, in 2001.[437] When not touring, Dylan is believed to live primarily in Point Dume, a promontory on the coast of Malibu, California, though he also owns property around the world.[438][439] Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small, close-knit Jewish community and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah.[440][13] Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League.[441] During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship.[197] Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\"[442][443] From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.[197][444] By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \"born again\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.\" [445] In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek: Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like \"Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain\" or \"I Saw the Light\"\u2014that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.[446] In an interview published in The New York Times on September 28, 1997, journalist Jon Pareles reported that \"Dylan says he now subscribes to no organized religion.\"[447] Dylan has supported the Chabad Lubavitch movement,[448] and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including the Bar Mitzvahs of his sons and attending Hadar Hatorah, a Chabad Lubavitch yeshiva. In September 1989 and September 1991, he appeared on the Chabad telethon.[449] On Yom Kippur in 2007 he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was called to the Torah for the sixth aliyah.[450] Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has also made passing references to his religious faith\u2014such as in a 2004 interview with 60 Minutes, when he told Ed Bradley that \"the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God.\" He also explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the \"chief commander\u2014in this earth and in the world we can't see.\"[28] In a 2009 interview with Bill Flanagan promoting Dylan's Christmas LP, Christmas in the Heart, Flanagan commented on the \"heroic performance\" Dylan gave of \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" and that he \"delivered the song like a true believer.\" Dylan replied: \"Well, I am a true believer.\"[307] Dylan has won many awards throughout his career including the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, ten Grammy Awards,[451] one Academy Award and one Golden Globe Award. He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In May 2000, Dylan received the Polar Music Prize from Sweden's King Carl XVI.[452] In June 2007, Dylan received the Prince of Asturias Award in the Arts category.[453] Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in May 2012.[454][455] In February 2015, Dylan accepted the MusiCares Person of the Year award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, in recognition of his philanthropic and artistic contributions to society.[456] In November 2013, Dylan received the accolade of L\u00e9gion d'Honneur from the French education minister Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti.[457] The Nobel Prize committee announced on October 13, 2016, that it would be awarding Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"[4][458] The New York Times reported: \"Mr. Dylan, 75, is the first musician to win the award, and his selection on Thursday is perhaps the most radical choice in a history stretching back to 1901.\"[459] A member of the Swedish Academy, Per W\u00e4stberg, called Dylan \"impolite and arrogant\" for ignoring the Nobel Committee's attempts to contact him.[460] Academy permanent secretary Sara Danius responded, \"The Swedish Academy has never held a view on a prizewinner's decision in this context, neither will it now.\"[461] After two weeks of speculation about Dylan's silence concerning the Nobel Prize,[462] he said in an interview with Edna Gundersen that getting the award was: \"amazing, incredible. Whoever dreams about something like that?\"[463] The Swedish Academy announced in November that Dylan would not travel to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize Ceremony due to \"pre-existing commitments.\"[464] At the Nobel Banquet in Stockholm on December 10, 2016, Dylan's speech was given by Azita Raji, U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. Patti Smith accepted Dylan's Nobel and performed his song \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" to orchestral accompaniment.[465] On April 2, 2017, Academy secretary Danius reported: \"Earlier today the Swedish Academy met with Bob Dylan for a private ceremony [with no media present] in Stockholm, during which Dylan received his gold medal and diploma. Twelve members of the Academy were present. Spirits were high. Champagne was had. Quite a bit of time was spent looking closely at the gold medal, in particular the beautifully crafted back, an image of a young man sitting under a laurel tree who listens to the Muse. Taken from Virgil's Aeneid, the inscription reads: Inventas vitam iuvat excoluisse per artes, loosely translated as \"And they who bettered life on earth by their newly found mastery.\"[466] Dylan's Nobel Lecture was posted on the Nobel prize website on June 5, 2017.[467] The New York Times pointed out that, in order to collect the prize's eight million Swedish krona ($900,000), the Swedish Academy's rules stipulate the laureate \"must deliver a lecture within six months of the official ceremony, which would have made Mr. Dylan's deadline June 10.\"[468] Academy secretary Danius commented: \"The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close.\"[469] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: \"Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, 'Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story'.\"[470] Dylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century, where he was called \"master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation.\"[471] In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\"[472] President Barack Obama said of Dylan in 2012, \"There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music.\"[317] For 20 years, academics lobbied the Swedish Academy to give Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature.[473][474][475][476] He received the award in 2016,[459] making Dylan the first musician to be awarded the Literature Prize.[459] Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, described Dylan's place in literary history: ...a singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards.[477] Rolling Stone has ranked Dylan at number one in its 2015 list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time,[478] and listed \"Like A Rolling Stone\" as the \"Greatest Song of all Time\" in their 2011 list.[479] In 2008, it was estimated that Dylan had sold about 120 million albums worldwide.[480] Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie,[481] the blues of Robert Johnson,[482] and what he termed the \"architectural forms\" of Hank Williams songs,[483] Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry.\"[484] Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: \"[Dylan's] early songs were very rich\u00a0... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while.\"[485] When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to a rock backing, the mix became more complex. For many critics, his greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-1960s trilogy of albums\u2014Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde. In Mike Marqusee's words: Between late 1964 and the middle of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, symbolist, modernist and Beat poetry, surrealism and Dada, advertising jargon and social commentary, Fellini and Mad magazine, he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console.[486] Dylan's lyrics began to receive detailed scrutiny from academics and poets as early as 1998, when Stanford University sponsored the first international academic conference on Bob Dylan to be held in the United States.[487] In 2004, Richard F. Thomas, Classics professor at Harvard University, created a freshman seminar titled \"Dylan\" \"to put the artist in context of not just popular culture of the last half-century, but the tradition of classical poets like Virgil and Homer.\"[488] Literary critic Christopher Ricks published Dylan's Visions of Sin, a 500-page analysis of Dylan's work,[489] and has said: \"I'd not have written a book about Dylan, to stand alongside my books on Milton and Keats, Tennyson and T.S. Eliot, if I didn't think Dylan a genius of and with language.[490] Former British poet laureate Andrew Motion suggested his lyrics should be studied in schools.[491] The critical consensus that Dylan's song writing was his outstanding creative achievement was articulated by Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica where his entry stated: \"Hailed as the Shakespeare of his generation, Dylan... set the standard for lyric writing.\"[492] Dylan's voice also received critical attention. Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as \"a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk's.\"[493] David Bowie, in his tribute, \"Song for Bob Dylan\", described Dylan's singing as \"a voice like sand and glue.\" His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on \"Like a Rolling Stone\" as \"at once young and jeeringly cynical.\"[494] As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal Oral Tradition, \"Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs\u2014this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in \"Everything is Broken\" (on the album Oh Mercy) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality.\"[495] Dylan is considered a seminal influence on many musical genres. As Edna Gundersen stated in USA Today: \"Dylan's musical DNA has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since 1962.\"[496] Punk musician Joe Strummer praised Dylan for having \"laid down the template for lyric, tune, seriousness, spirituality, depth of rock music.\"[497] Other major musicians who acknowledged Dylan's importance include Johnny Cash,[498] Jerry Garcia,[499] John Lennon,[500] Paul McCartney,[501] Pete Townshend,[502] Neil Young,[503] Bruce Springsteen,[3] David Bowie,[504] Bryan Ferry,[505] Nick Cave,[506][507] Patti Smith,[508] Syd Barrett,[509] Joni Mitchell,[510] Tom Waits[511] and Leonard Cohen.[512] Dylan significantly contributed to the initial success of both the Byrds and the Band: the Byrds achieved chart success with their version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and the subsequent album, while the Band were Dylan's backing band on his 1966 tour, recorded The Basement Tapes with him in 1967[513] and featured three previously unreleased Dylan songs on their debut album.[514] Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom, Nik Cohn objected: \"I can't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as everything else he's been worshipped as. The way I see him, he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype.\"[515] Australian critic Jack Marx credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: \"What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since, with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem educating themselves from the Dylan handbook.\"[516] Fellow musicians have also presented dissenting views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a \"plagiarist\" and his voice as \"fake\" in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times, despite the fact that Mitchell had toured with Dylan in the past, and both artists have covered each others songs.[517][518] Mitchell's comment led to discussions of Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing him.[519] Talking to Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of Henry Timrod's verse in his album Modern Times,[276] by saying that it was \"part of the tradition.\"[520][a 5] If Dylan's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music,[486] critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. Following the release of Todd Haynes' Dylan biopic I'm Not There, J. Hoberman wrote in his 2007 Village Voice review: Elvis might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then\u2014having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning\u2014vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.[521] When Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, The New York Times commented: \"In choosing a popular musician for the literary world's highest honor, the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, dramatically redefined the boundaries of literature, setting off a debate about whether song lyrics have the same artistic value as poetry or novels.\"[459] Responses varied from the sarcasm of Irvine Welsh, who described it as \"an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies\",[522] to the enthusiasm of Salman Rushdie who tweeted: \"From Orpheus to Faiz, song & poetry have been closely linked. Dylan is the brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition. Great choice.\"[523] Dylan's archive, comprising notebooks, song drafts, business contracts, recordings and movie out-takes, is held at the Gilcrease Museum's Helmerich Center for American Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is also the home of the papers of Woody Guthrie.[356][524] In 2017, the George Kaiser Family Foundation announced a design competition for a major Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa's Arts District.[525][526] In 2018, the foundation announced that it had selected Olson Kundig Architects to design the building.[527] The center is expected to open in 2021, and be located next to the facility dedicated to Guthrie.[528] In 2005, 7th Avenue East in Hibbing, Minnesota, the street on which Dylan lived from ages 6 to 18, received the honorary name Bob Dylan Drive.[529][530][531] In the town Hibbing, a walk of fame-styled \"star\" is embedded in a sidewalk with the words Bob Dylan as well as a cursive-Z for Dylan's nickname Zimmy in youth.[532] In 2006 a cultural pathway, Bob Dylan Way, was inaugurated in Duluth, Minnesota, the city where Dylan was born. The 1.8 mile path links \"cultural and historically significant areas of downtown for the tourists.\"[533][534] In 2015, a massive Bob Dylan mural was unveiled in downtown Minneapolis, the city where Dylan attended university for a year. The mural was designed by Brazilian street artist Eduardo Kobra.[535]",

Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights movement and anti-war movement. His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture.\nFollowing his self-titled debut album in 1962, which mainly comprised traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan the following year. The album featured \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\". For many of these songs, he adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan encountered controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966). Commenting on the six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965), Rolling Stone wrote: \"No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time.\"[3]\nIn July 1966, Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of The Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album The Basement Tapes in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in John Wesley Harding (1967), Nashville Skyline (1969), and New Morning (1970). In 1975, he released Blood on the Tracks, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. The major works of his later career include Time Out of Mind (1997), Love and Theft (2001), Modern Times (2006) and Tempest (2012). His most recent recordings have comprised versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour.\nSince 1994, Dylan has published eight books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 100\u00a0million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"[4]\nBob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman (Hebrew: .mw-parser-output .script-hebrew,.mw-parser-output .script-Hebr{font-size:1.15em;font-family:\"Ezra SIL\",\"Ezra SIL SR\",\"Keter Aram Tsova\",\"Taamey Ashkenaz\",\"Taamey David CLM\",\"Taamey Frank CLM\",\"Frank Ruehl CLM\",\"Keter YG\",\"Shofar\",\"David CLM\",\"Hadasim CLM\",\"Simple CLM\",\"Nachlieli\",\"SBL BibLit\",\"SBL Hebrew\",Cardo,Alef,\"Noto Serif Hebrew\",\"Noto Sans Hebrew\",\"David Libre\",David,\"Times New Roman\",Gisha,Arial,FreeSerif,FreeSans}\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d9\u05e1\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham)[1][5][6] in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota,[7][8] and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Range west of Lake Superior. Dylan's paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the United States following the anti-Semitic pogroms of 1905.[9] His maternal grandparents, Ben and Florence Stone, were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902.[9] In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan wrote that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from the Ka\u011f\u0131zman district of Kars Province in northeastern Turkey.[10]\nDylan's father, Abram Zimmerman\u2014an electric-appliance shop owner\u2014and mother, Beatrice \"Beatty\" Stone, were part of a small, close-knit Jewish community.[11][12][13] They lived in Duluth until Dylan was six, when his father had polio and the family returned to his mother's hometown, Hibbing, where they lived for the rest of Dylan's childhood. In his early years he listened to the radio\u2014first to blues and country stations from Shreveport, Louisiana, and later, when he was a teenager, to rock and roll.[14]\nDylan formed several bands while attending Hibbing High School. In the Golden Chords, he performed covers of songs by Little Richard[15] and Elvis Presley.[16] Their performance of Danny &amp; the Juniors' \"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone.[17] In 1959, Dylan's high school yearbook carried the caption \"Robert Zimmerman: to join 'Little Richard'.\"[15][18] That year, as Elston Gunnn, he performed two dates with Bobby Vee, playing piano and clapping.[19][20][21] In September 1959, Dylan moved to Minneapolis and enrolled at the University of Minnesota.[22] His focus on rock and roll gave way to American folk music, as he explained in a 1985 interview:\nThe thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.[23]\nLiving at the Jewish-centric fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu house, Dylan began to perform at the Ten\u00a0O'Clock Scholar, a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus, and became involved in the Dinkytown folk music circuit.[24][25] During this period, he began introducing himself as \"Bob Dylan.\"[26][a 1] In his memoir, he said he hit upon using this less common variant for Dillon\u2014a surname he had considered adopting\u2014when he unexpectedly saw poems by Dylan Thomas.[27] Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, he said, \"You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free.\"[28]\nIn May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie,[29] who was seriously ill with Huntington's disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.[30] Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. Describing Guthrie's impact, he wrote: \"The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple.\"[31] As well as visiting Guthrie in hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ramblin' Jack Elliott. Much of Guthrie's repertoire was channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in Chronicles: Volume One.[32]\nFrom February 1961, Dylan played at clubs around Greenwich Village, befriending and picking up material from folk singers there, including Dave Van\u00a0Ronk, Fred Neil, Odetta, the New Lost City Ramblers and Irish musicians the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem.[33] On April 11, Dylan commenced a two-week engagement at Gerde's Folk City, supporting John Lee Hooker.[34] New York Times critic Robert Shelton first considered Dylan in a review of Izzy Young's production for WRVR of a live twelve-hour Hootenanny on July 29, 1961: \"Among the newer promising talents deserving mention are a 20-year-old latter-day Guthrie disciple named Bob Dylan, with a curiously arresting mumbling, country-steeped manner.\" This was Dylan's first radio performance.[35] In September, Shelton boosted Dylan's career with an enthusiastic review of his performance at Gerde's Folk City.[36] That month, Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester's third album. This brought him to the attention of the album's producer, John Hammond,[37] who signed Dylan to Columbia Records.[38]\nDylan's first album, Bob Dylan, released March 19, 1962,[39] consisted of familiar folk, blues and gospel with two original compositions. The album sold only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even.[40] Within Columbia Records, some referred to Dylan as \"Hammond's Folly\"[41] and suggested dropping his contract, but Hammond defended him and was supported by songwriter Johnny Cash.[40] In March 1962, Dylan contributed harmonica and backup vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen, accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records.[42] While working for Columbia, Dylan recorded under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt[43] for Broadside, a folk magazine and record label.[44] Dylan used the pseudonym Bob Landy to record as a piano player on The Blues Project, a 1964 anthology album by Elektra Records.[43] As Tedham Porterhouse, Dylan played harmonica on Ramblin' Jack Elliott's 1964 album Jack Elliott.[43]\nDylan made two important career moves in August 1962: he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan,[45][46] and signed a management contract with Albert Grossman.[47] (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.)[48] Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was known for his sometimes confrontational personality and protective loyalty.[49] Dylan said, \"He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure\u00a0... you could smell him coming.\"[25] Tension between Grossman and John Hammond led to the latter suggesting Dylan work with the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson, who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit. Wilson produced the next three albums Dylan recorded.[50][51]\nDylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963.[52] He had been invited by television director Philip Saville to appear in a drama, Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television.[53] At the end of the play, Dylan performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\", one of its first public performances.[53] The film recording of Madhouse on Castle Street was discarded by the BBC in 1968.[53] While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including the Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies.[52] He also learned material from UK performers, including Martin Carthy.[53]\nBy the release of Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer-songwriter. Many songs on the album were labeled protest songs, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger's passion for topical songs.[54] \"Oxford Town\", for example, was an account of James Meredith's ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi.[55] The first song on the album, \"Blowin' in the Wind\", partly derived its melody from the traditional slave song, \"No More Auction Block\",[56] while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary.[57] Another song, \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", was based on the folk ballad \"Lord Randall\". With veiled references to an impending apocalypse, it gained resonance when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.[58][a 2] Like \"Blowin' in the Wind\", \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" marked a new direction in songwriting, blending a stream-of-consciousness, imagist lyrical attack with traditional folk form.[59]\nDylan's topical songs led to his being viewed as more than just a songwriter. Janet Maslin wrote in 1980[60] of Freewheelin': \"These were the songs that established [Dylan] as the voice of his generation\u2014someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about nuclear disarmament and the growing Civil Rights Movement: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.\"[61][a 3] Freewheelin' also included love songs and surreal talking blues. Humor was an important part of Dylan's persona,[62] and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including the Beatles. George Harrison said of the album: \"We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude\u2014it was incredibly original and wonderful.\"[63]\nThe rough edge of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some but an attraction to others. Novelist Joyce Carol Oates wrote: \"When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying.\"[64] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate and lover.[65] Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.[66][67] \"It didn't take long before people got it, that he was pretty damned special,\" says Baez.[68]\nOthers who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included the Byrds, Sonny &amp; Cher, the Hollies, Peter, Paul and Mary, the Association, Manfred Mann and the Turtles. Most attempted a pop feel and rhythm, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk songs. The covers became so ubiquitous that CBS promoted him with the slogan \"Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan\".[69]\n\"Mixed-Up Confusion\", recorded during the Freewheelin' sessions with a backing band, was released as a single but quickly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound. Cameron Crowe described it as \"a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records.\"[70]\nIn May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\" was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.[71]\nBy this time, Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.[72] Dylan's third album, The Times They Are a-Changin', reflected a more politicized Dylan.[73] The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with \"Only a Pawn in Their Game\" addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers; and the Brechtian \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.[74] On a more general theme, \"Ballad of Hollis Brown\" and \"North Country Blues\" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, \"Boots of Spanish Leather\" and \"One Too Many Mornings\".[75]\nBy the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.[76] Accepting the \"Tom Paine Award\" from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.[77]\nAnother Side of Bob Dylan, recorded in a single evening on June 9, 1964,[78] had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on \"I Shall Be Free No.\u00a010\" and \"Motorpsycho Nightmare\". \"Spanish Harlem Incident\" and \"To Ramona\" are passionate love songs, while \"Black Crow Blues\" and \"I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)\" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. \"It Ain't Me Babe\", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him.[79] His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic \"Chimes of Freedom\", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as \"chains of flashing images,\"[80] and \"My Back Pages\", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.[81]\nIn the latter half of 1964 and into 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to folk-rock pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed \"Beatle boots\". A London reporter wrote: \"Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo.\"[82] Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Appearing on the Les Crane television show and asked about a movie he planned, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, \"No, I play my mother.\"[83]\nDylan's late March 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was another leap,[84] featuring his first recordings with electric instruments, under producer Tom Wilson's guidance.[85] The first single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", owed much to Chuck Berry's \"Too Much Monkey Business\";[86] its free association lyrics described as harking back to the energy of beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip-hop.[87] The song was provided with an early video, which opened D. A. Pennebaker's cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of Great Britain, Dont Look Back.[88] Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground. Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements.[89]\nThe second side of Bringing It All Back Home contained four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.[90] \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" became one of his best-known songs when the Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK.[91][92] \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" and \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" were two of Dylan's most important compositions.[90][93]\nIn 1965, headlining the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a pickup group featuring Mike Bloomfield on guitar and Al Kooper on organ.[94] Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. Murray Lerner, who filmed the performance, said: \"I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric.\"[95] An alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short set. This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival, who reports his recording proves the only boos were in reaction to the MC's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set.[96][97]\nNevertheless, Dylan's performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.[98][99] In the September issue of Sing Out!, Ewan MacColl wrote: \"Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time\u00a0...'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers\u00a0... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel.\"[100] On July 29, four days after Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording \"Positively 4th Street\". The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia,[101] and it has been interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community\u2014friends he had known in clubs along West 4th Street.[102]\nIn July 1965, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" peaked at number two in the U.S. chart. In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".[3][103] Bruce Springsteen, in his speech for Dylan's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that on first hearing the single, \"that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind.\"[104] The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.[105] The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. \"Desolation Row\", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass,[106] offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as \"an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical (Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse\".[107]\nIn support of the album, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts with Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew and Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, former members of Ronnie Hawkins's backing band the Hawks.[108] On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound. The band's reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable.[109]\nFrom September 24, 1965, in Austin, Texas, Dylan toured the U.S. and Canada for six months, backed by the five musicians from the Hawks who became known as the Band.[110] While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences, their studio efforts floundered. Producer Bob Johnston persuaded Dylan to record in Nashville in February 1966, and surrounded him with top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions.[111] The Nashville sessions produced the double album Blonde on Blonde (1966), featuring what Dylan called \"that thin wild mercury sound\".[112] Kooper described it as \"taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion\": the musical world of Nashville and the world of the \"quintessential New York hipster\" Bob Dylan.[113]\nOn November 22, 1965, Dylan quietly married 25-year-old former model Sara Lownds.[114] Robertson has described how he received a phone call that morning to accompany the couple to a courthouse on Long Island, and then to a reception hosted by Albert and Sally Grossman at the Algonquin Hotel.[115] Some of Dylan's friends, including Ramblin' Jack Elliott, say that, immediately after the event, Dylan denied he was married.[114] Journalist Nora Ephron made the news public in the New York Post in February 1966 with the headline \"Hush! Bob Dylan is wed.\"[116]\nDylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each show was split in two. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. In the second, backed by the Hawks, he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slow handclapped.[117] The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17, 1966.[118] A recording of this concert was released in 1998: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: \"Judas!\" to which Dylan responded, \"I don't believe you\u00a0... You're a liar!\" Dylan turned to his band and said, \"Play it fucking loud!\"[119] as they launched into the final song of the night\u2014\"Like a Rolling Stone\".\nDuring his 1966 tour, Dylan was described as exhausted and acting \"as if on a death trip\".[120] D. A. Pennebaker, the filmmaker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as \"taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else\".[121] In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, \"I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things\u00a0... just to keep going, you know?\"[122] In 2011, BBC Radio 4 reported that, in an interview that Robert Shelton taped in 1966, Dylan said he had kicked heroin in New York City: \"I got very, very strung out for a while\u00a0... I had about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it.\"[123] Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had \"been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career\".[124][125]\nAfter his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show.[126] His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year.\nOn July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck.[127] Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.[127][128] Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him.[127][129] Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\"[130] Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.[128][131]\nOnce Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.[132] The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals.[133] In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \"Big Pink\".[134] These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for Julie Driscoll and the Brian Auger Trinity (\"This Wheel's on Fire\"), the Byrds (\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\", \"Nothing Was Delivered\"), and Manfred Mann (\"Mighty Quinn\"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as The Basement Tapes. Over the years, many more songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on bootleg recordings, culminating in the 2014 official Columbia release The Basement Tapes Complete which contained 138 songs and alternate takes.[135] In the coming months, the Hawks recorded the album Music from Big Pink using songs they worked on in their basement in Woodstock, and renamed themselves the Band,[136] beginning a long recording and performing career of their own.\nIn October and November 1967, Dylan returned to Nashville.[137] Back in the studio after 19 months, he was accompanied by Charlie McCoy on bass,[137] Kenny Buttrey on drums,[137] and Pete Drake on steel guitar.[137] The result was John Wesley Harding, a contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on the American West and the Bible. The sparse structure and instrumentation, with lyrics that took the Judeo-Christian tradition seriously, departed from Dylan's own work and from the psychedelic fervor of the 1960s.[138] It included \"All Along the Watchtower\", with lyrics derived from the Book of Isaiah (21:5\u20139). The song was later recorded by Jimi Hendrix, whose version Dylan acknowledged as definitive.[23] Woody Guthrie died on October 3, 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at Carnegie Hall on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by the Band.[139]\nDylan's next release, Nashville Skyline (1969), was mainstream country featuring Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with Johnny Cash, and the hit single \"Lay Lady Lay\".[141] Variety wrote, \"Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range.\"[142] During one recording session, Dylan and Cash recorded a series of duets but only their version of Dylan's \"Girl from the North Country\" was released on the album.[143][144]\nIn May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of Johnny Cash's television show and sang a duet with Cash of \"Girl from the North Country\", with solos of \"Living the Blues\" and \"I Threw It All Away.\"[145] Dylan next traveled to England to top the bill at the Isle of Wight festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the Woodstock Festival closer to his home.[146]\nIn the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable. Rolling Stone writer Greil Marcus asked \"What is this shit?\" on first listening to Self Portrait, released in June 1970.[147][148] It was a double LP including few original songs, and was poorly received.[149] In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, considered a return to form.[150] This album included \"Day of the Locusts\", a song in which Dylan gave an account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970.[151] In November 1968, Dylan had co-written \"I'd Have You Anytime\" with George Harrison;[152] Harrison recorded \"I'd Have You Anytime\" and Dylan's \"If Not for You\" for his 1970 solo triple album All Things Must Pass. Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh attracted media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.[153]\nBetween March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock, a small studio in Greenwich Village, to record with Leon Russell. These sessions resulted in \"Watching the River Flow\" and a new recording of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\".[154] On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded \"George Jackson\", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin State Prison that year.[155] Dylan contributed piano and harmony to Steve Goodman's album, Somebody Else's Troubles, under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas (referencing Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas and his own previous name) in September 1972.[156]\nIn 1972, Dylan signed to Sam Peckinpah's film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, providing songs and backing music for the movie, and playing \"Alias\", a member of Billy's gang with some historical basis.[157] Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" became one of Dylan's most covered songs.[158][159]\nAlso in 1972, Dylan protested the move to deport John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who had been convicted of possessing cannabis, by sending a letter to the U.S. Immigration Service, in part: \"Hurray for John &amp; Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country's got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!\"[160]\nDylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records when his contract with Columbia Records expired.[162] His next album, Planet Waves, was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour.[163] The album included two versions of \"Forever Young\", which became one of his most popular songs.[164] As one critic described it, the song projected \"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\",[165] and Dylan himself commented: \"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\"[23] Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes, widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.[166]\nIn January 1974, Dylan, backed by the Band, embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts\u2014his first tour for seven years. A live double album, Before the Flood, was released on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold.\"[167] Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, unhappy that Geffen had sold only 600,000 copies of Planet Waves despite millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour;[168] he returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums.[169]\nAfter the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974.[170] Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.[171]\nReleased in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\"[172] In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\"[172] Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements. For the Salon website, journalist Bill Wyman wrote: \"Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.\"[173] Novelist Rick Moody called it \"the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape.\"[174]\nIn the middle of that year, Dylan wrote a ballad championing boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, imprisoned for a triple murder in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1966. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote \"Hurricane\", presenting the case for Carter's innocence. Despite its length\u2014over eight minutes\u2014the song was released as a single, peaking at 33 on the U.S. Billboard chart, and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue.[a 4][175] The tour featured about one hundred performers and supporters from the Greenwich Village folk scene, including T-Bone Burnett, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Joni Mitchell,[176][177] David Mansfield, Roger McGuinn, Mick Ronson, Joan Baez, and Scarlet Rivera, whom Dylan discovered walking down the street, her violin case on her back.[178] Allen Ginsberg accompanied the troupe, staging scenes for the film Dylan was shooting. Sam Shepard was hired to write the screenplay, but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler.[179]\nRunning through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album Desire, with many of Dylan's new songs featuring a travelogue-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright Jacques Levy.[180][181] The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, Hard Rain, and the LP Hard Rain; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002's Live 1975.[182]\nA documentary of the 1975 leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue, Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese was released by Netflix on June 12, 2019, with a fourteen-CD box set of rehearsals and five complete recordings of Dylan's performances from the Revue released on June 7, 2019, as The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings. The documentary features participants interviewed by Jeff Rosen over decades and it was assembled by Martin Scorsese and editor David Tedeschi.[183]\nThe 1975 tour with the Revue provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film Renaldo and Clara, a sprawling narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences. Released in 1978, the movie received poor, sometimes scathing, reviews.[184][185] Later in that year, a two-hour edit, dominated by the concert performances, was more widely released.[186]\nIn November 1976, Dylan appeared at the Band's \"farewell\" concert, with Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Van Morrison and Neil Young. Martin Scorsese's cinematic chronicle, The Last Waltz, in 1978 included about half of Dylan's set.[187] In 1976, Dylan wrote and duetted on \"Sign Language\" for Eric Clapton's No Reason To Cry.[188]\nIn 1978, Dylan embarked on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million. Dylan assembled an eight-piece band and three backing singers. Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were released as the live double album, Bob Dylan At Budokan.[189] Reviews were mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, giving the album a derisory review,[190] while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing: \"These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals.\"[191] When Dylan brought the tour to the U.S. in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a 'Las Vegas Tour'.[192] The 1978 tour grossed more than $20\u00a0million, and Dylan told the Los Angeles Times that he had debts because \"I had a couple of bad years. I put a lot of money into the movie, built a big house \u00a0... and it costs a lot to get divorced in California.\"[189]\nIn April and May 1978, Dylan took the same band and vocalists into Rundown Studios in Santa Monica, California, to record an album of new material: Street-Legal.[193] It was described by Michael Gray as, \"after Blood On The Tracks, arguably Dylan's best record of the 1970s: a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan's own life.\"[194] However, it had poor sound and mixing (attributed to Dylan's studio practices), muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs' strengths.[195]\nIn the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Evangelical Christianity,[196][197] undertaking a three-month discipleship course run by the Association of Vineyard Churches;[198][199] and released two albums of contemporary gospel music. Slow Train Coming (1979) featured the guitar accompaniment of Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits) and was produced by veteran R&amp;B producer Jerry Wexler. Wexler said that Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording. He replied: \"Bob, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album.\"[200] Dylan won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song \"Gotta Serve Somebody.\" His second Christian-themed album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as \"the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior\"[201] When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:\nYears ago they\u00a0... said I was a prophet. I used to say, \"No I'm not a prophet\" they say \"Yes you are, you're a prophet.\" I said, \"No it's not me.\" They used to say \"You sure are a prophet.\" They used to convince me I was a prophet. Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer. They say, \"Bob Dylan's no prophet.\" They just can't handle it.[202]\nDylan's Christianity was unpopular with some fans and musicians.[203] Shortly before his murder, John Lennon recorded \"Serve Yourself\" in response to Dylan's \"Gotta Serve Somebody.\"[204] By 1981, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times that \"neither age (he's now 40) nor his much-publicized conversion to born-again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament.\"[205]\nIn late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as \"A Musical Retrospective\", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. Shot of Love, recorded early the next year, featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs. \"Every Grain of Sand\" reminded some of William Blake's verses.[206]\nIn the 1980s, reception of Dylan's recordings varied, from the well-regarded Infidels in 1983 to the panned Down in the Groove in 1988. Michael Gray condemned Dylan's 1980s albums for carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.[207] As an example of the latter, the Infidels recording sessions, which again employed Knopfler on lead guitar and also as the album's producer, resulted in several notable songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were \"Blind Willie McTell\", a tribute to the dead blues musician and an evocation of African American history,[208] \"Foot of Pride\" and \"Lord Protect My Child.\" These three songs were released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961\u20131991.[209]\nBetween July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded Empire Burlesque.[210] Arthur Baker, who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper, was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound \"a little bit more contemporary.\"[210]\nIn 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single \"We Are the World.\" He also joined Artists United Against Apartheid providing vocals for their single \"Sun City.\"[211] On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of \"Hollis Brown\", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: \"I hope that some of the money\u00a0... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe\u00a0... one or two million, maybe\u00a0... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks.\"[212] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.[213]\nIn April 1986, Dylan made a foray into rap music when he added vocals to the opening verse of \"Street Rock\", featured on Kurtis Blow's album Kingdom Blow.[214] Dylan's next studio album, Knocked Out Loaded, in July 1986 contained three covers (by Little Junior Parker, Kris Kristofferson and the gospel hymn \"Precious Memories\"), plus three collaborations (with Tom Petty, Sam Shepard and Carole Bayer Sager), and two solo compositions by Dylan. One reviewer commented that \"the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating.\"[215] It was the first Dylan album since Freewheelin' (1963) to fail to make the Top 50.[216] Since then, some critics have called the 11-minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, \"Brownsville Girl\", a work of genius.[217]\nIn 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with the Grateful Dead in 1987, resulting in a live album Dylan &amp; The Dead. This received negative reviews; AllMusic said it was \"Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead.\"[218] Dylan then initiated what came to be called the Never Ending Tour on June 7, 1988, performing with a back-up band featuring guitarist G. E. Smith. Dylan would continue to tour with a small, changing band for the next 30 years.[219]\nIn 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett.[220] Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack\u2014\"Night After Night\", and \"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \"The Usual.\" The film was a critical and commercial flop.[221]\nDylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\"[222]\nThe album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album.[223] Michael Gray wrote: \"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\"[224] The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart,[223] featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.[225] Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.[226]\nDylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\"[224][227] The track \"Most of the Time\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \"What Was It You Wanted?\" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.[228] The religious imagery of \"Ring Them Bells\" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.[229]\nDylan's 1990s began with Under the Red Sky (1990), an about-face from the serious Oh Mercy. The album contained several apparently simple songs, including \"Under the Red Sky\" and \"Wiggle Wiggle.\" The album was dedicated to \"Gabby Goo Goo\", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four.[230] Sidemen on the album included George Harrison, Slash from Guns N' Roses, David Crosby, Bruce Hornsby, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Elton John. Despite the line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.[231]\nIn 1991, Dylan received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from American actor Jack Nicholson.[232] The event coincided with the start of the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, and Dylan performed \"Masters of War.\" Dylan then made a short speech, saying \"My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.'\"[232][233] This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.[234]\nOver the next few years Dylan returned to his roots with two albums covering traditional folk and blues songs: Good as I Been to You (1992) and World Gone Wrong (1993), backed solely by his acoustic guitar.[235] Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song \"Lone Pilgrim\",[236] written by a 19th-century teacher. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on hits.[237] The album from it, MTV Unplugged, included \"John Brown\", an unreleased 1962 song of how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.[238]\nWith a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch,[239] Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.[240] Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, \"I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon.\"[241] He was back on the road by mid-year, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric \"Blowin' in the Wind.\"[242]\nIn September Dylan released the new Lanois-produced album, Time Out of Mind. With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. One critic wrote: \"the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years.\"[243] This collection of complex songs won him his first solo \"Album of the Year\" Grammy Award.[244]\nIn December 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton presented Dylan with a Kennedy Center Honor in the East Room of the White House, paying this tribute: \"He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful.\"[245]\nDylan commenced the 2000s by winning the Polar Music Prize in May 2000 and his first Oscar; his song \"Things Have Changed\", written for the film Wonder Boys, won an Academy Award in March 2001.[247] The Oscar, by some reports a facsimile, tours with him, presiding over shows perched atop an amplifier.[248]\n\"Love and Theft\" was released on September 11, 2001. Recorded with his touring band, Dylan produced the album himself under the pseudonym Jack Frost.[249] The album was critically well received and earned nominations for several Grammy awards.[250] Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly, Western swing, jazz, and even lounge ballads.[251] \"Love and Theft\" generated controversy when The Wall Street Journal pointed out similarities between the album's lyrics and Japanese author Junichi Saga's book Confessions of a Yakuza.[252][253]\nIn 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his Christian period and participated in the CD project Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan. That year Dylan also released the film Masked &amp; Anonymous, which he co-wrote with director Larry Charles under the alias Sergei Petrov.[254] Dylan played the central character in the film, Jack Fate, alongside a cast that included Jeff Bridges, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and John Goodman. The film polarised critics: many dismissed it as an \"incoherent mess\";[255][256] a few treated it as a serious work of art.[257][258]\nIn October 2004, Dylan published the first part of his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One. Confounding expectations,[259] Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961\u20131962, virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height. He also devoted chapters to the albums New Morning (1970) and Oh Mercy (1989). The book reached number two on The New York Times' Hardcover Non-Fiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a National Book Award.[260]\nNo Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's acclaimed film biography of Dylan,[261] was first broadcast on September 26\u201327, 2005, on BBC Two in the UK and PBS in the US.[262] The documentary focuses on the period from Dylan's arrival in New York in 1961 to his motorcycle crash in 1966, featuring interviews with Suze Rotolo, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Pete Seeger, Mavis Staples, and Dylan himself. The film received a Peabody Award in April 2006[263] and a Columbia-duPont Award in January 2007.[264] The accompanying soundtrack featured unreleased songs from Dylan's early career.[265]\nDylan earned another distinction when a 2007 study of US legal opinions found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers more than those of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by the Beatles, who were second. Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, both conservatives. The most widely cited lines included \"you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows\" from \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" and \"when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose\" from \"Like a Rolling Stone.\"[266][267]\nDylan's career as a radio presenter commenced on May 3, 2006, with his weekly radio program, Theme Time Radio Hour for XM Satellite Radio, with song selections revolving around chosen themes.[268][269] Dylan played classic and obscure records from the 1920s to the present day, including contemporary artists as diverse as Blur, Prince, L.L. Cool J and the Streets. The show was praised by fans and critics as \"great radio,\" as Dylan told stories and made eclectic references, commenting on his musical choices.[270][271] In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was \"Goodbye\" and the final record played was Woody Guthrie's \"So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh.\"[272]\nDylan released his Modern Times album in August 2006. Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for The Guardian characterised his singing on the album as \"a catarrhal death rattle\"[273]) most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, embracing Time Out of Mind and \"Love and Theft\".[274] Modern Times entered the U.S. charts at number one, making it Dylan's first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire.[275] The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylan's lyrics in Modern Times and the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod.[276]\nNominated for three Grammy Awards, Modern Times won Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album and Bob Dylan also won Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for \"Someday Baby.\" Modern Times was named Album of the Year, 2006, by Rolling Stone magazine,[277] and by Uncut in the UK.[278] On the same day that Modern Times was released the iTunes Music Store released Bob Dylan: The Collection, a digital box set containing all of his albums (773 tracks in total), along with 42 rare and unreleased tracks.[279]\nIn August 2007, the award-winning film biography of Dylan I'm Not There, written and directed by Todd Haynes, was released\u2014bearing the tagline \"inspired by the music and many lives of Bob Dylan.\"[280][281] The movie used six different actors to represent different aspects of Dylan's life: Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger and Ben Whishaw.[281][282] Dylan's previously unreleased 1967 recording from which the film takes its name[283] was released for the first time on the film's original soundtrack; all other tracks are covers of Dylan songs, specially recorded for the movie by a diverse range of artists, including Sonic Youth, Eddie Vedder, Mason Jennings, Stephen Malkmus, Jeff Tweedy, Karen O, Willie Nelson, Cat Power, Richie Havens, and Tom Verlaine.[284]\nOn October 1, 2007, Columbia Records released the triple CD retrospective album Dylan, anthologising his entire career under the Dylan 07 logo.[285] The sophistication of the Dylan 07 marketing campaign was a reminder that Dylan's commercial profile had risen considerably since the 1990s. This became evident in 2004, when Dylan appeared in a TV advertisement for Victoria's Secret lingerie.[286] Three years later, in October 2007, he participated in a multi-media campaign for the 2008 Cadillac Escalade.[287][288] Then, in 2009, he gave the highest profile endorsement of his career, appearing with rapper will.i.am in a Pepsi ad that debuted during the telecast of Super Bowl XLIII.[289] The ad, broadcast to a record audience of 98 million viewers, opened with Dylan singing the first verse of \"Forever Young\" followed by will.i.am doing a hip hop version of the song's third and final verse.[290]\nThe Bootleg Series Vol. 8\u00a0\u2013 Tell Tale Signs was released in October 2008, as both a two-CD set and a three-CD version with a 150-page hardcover book. The set contains live performances and outtakes from selected studio albums from Oh Mercy to Modern Times, as well as soundtrack contributions and collaborations with David Bromberg and Ralph Stanley.[291] The pricing of the album\u2014the two-CD set went on sale for $18.99 and the three-CD version for $129.99\u2014led to complaints about \"rip-off packaging\" from some fans and commentators.[292][293] The release was widely acclaimed by critics.[294] The abundance of alternative takes and unreleased material suggested to one reviewer that this volume of old outtakes \"feels like a new Bob Dylan record, not only for the astonishing freshness of the material, but also for the incredible sound quality and organic feeling of everything here.\"[295]\nBob Dylan released his album Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song; initially only intending to record a single track, \"Life Is Hard,\" \"the record sort of took its own direction.\"[296] Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter.[297] \nThe album received largely favorable reviews,[298] although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work.[299]\nIn its first week of release, the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S.,[300] making Bob Dylan (67 years of age) the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart.[300] It also reached number one on the UK album chart, 39 years after Dylan's previous UK album chart topper New Morning. This meant that Dylan currently holds the record for the longest gap between solo number one albums in the UK chart.[301]\nDylan's album, Christmas in the Heart, was released in October 2009, comprising such Christmas standards as \"Little Drummer Boy\", \"Winter Wonderland\" and \"Here Comes Santa Claus.\"[302] Critics pointed out that Dylan was \"revisiting yuletide styles popularized by Nat King Cole, Mel Torm\u00e9, and the Ray Conniff Singers.\"[303] Dylan's royalties from the sale of this album were donated to the charities Feeding America in the USA, Crisis in the UK, and the World Food Programme.[304]\nThe album received generally favorable reviews.[305] The New Yorker wrote that Dylan had welded a pre-rock musical sound to \"some of his croakiest vocals in a while\", and speculated that  his intentions might be ironic: \"Dylan has a long and highly publicized history with Christianity; to claim there's not a wink in the childish optimism of 'Here Comes Santa Claus' or 'Winter Wonderland' is to ignore a half-century of biting satire.\"[306] In an interview published in The Big Issue, journalist Bill Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style, and Dylan responded: \"There wasn't any other way to play it. These songs are part of my life, just like folk songs. You have to play them straight too.\"[307]\nVolume 9 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, The Witmark Demos was issued in October 18, 2010. It comprised 47 demo recordings of songs taped between 1962 and 1964 for Dylan's earliest music publishers: Leeds Music in 1962, and Witmark Music from 1962 to 1964. One reviewer described the set as \"a hearty glimpse of young Bob Dylan changing the music business, and the world, one note at a time.\"[308] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a Metascore of 86, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[309] In the same week, Sony Legacy released Bob Dylan: The Original Mono Recordings, a box set that for the first time presented Dylan's eight earliest albums, from Bob Dylan (1962) to John Wesley Harding (1967), in their original mono mix in the CD format. The CDs were housed in miniature facsimiles of the original album covers, replete with original liner notes. The set was accompanied by a booklet featuring an essay by music critic Greil Marcus.[310][311]\nOn April 12, 2011, Legacy Recordings released Bob Dylan in Concert\u00a0\u2013 Brandeis University 1963, taped at Brandeis University on May 10, 1963, two weeks prior to the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. The tape was discovered in the archive of music writer Ralph J. Gleason, and the recording carries liner notes by Michael Gray, who says it captures Dylan \"from way back when Kennedy was President and the Beatles hadn't yet reached America. It reveals him not at any Big Moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period... This is the last live performance we have of Bob Dylan before he becomes a star.\"[312]\nThe extent to which his work was studied at an academic level was demonstrated on Dylan's 70th birthday on May 24, 2011, when three universities organized symposia on his work. The University of Mainz,[313] the University of Vienna,[314] and the University of Bristol[315] invited literary critics and cultural historians to give papers on aspects of Dylan's work. Other events, including tribute bands, discussions and simple singalongs, took place around the world, as reported in The Guardian: \"From Moscow to Madrid, Norway to Northampton and Malaysia to his home state of Minnesota, self-confessed 'Bobcats' will gather today to celebrate the 70th birthday of a giant of popular music.\"[316]\nOn May 29, 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Dylan a Presidential Medal of Freedom in the White House. At the ceremony, Obama praised Dylan's voice for its \"unique gravelly power that redefined not just what music sounded like but the message it carried and how it made people feel.\"[317]\nDylan's 35th studio album, Tempest was released on September 11, 2012.[318] The album features a tribute to John Lennon, \"Roll On John\", and the title track is a 14-minute song about the sinking of the Titanic.[319] Reviewing Tempest for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes gave the album five out of five stars, writing: \"Lyrically, Dylan is at the top of his game, joking around, dropping wordplay and allegories that evade pat readings and quoting other folks' words like a freestyle rapper on fire.\"[320] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a score of 83 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[321]\nVolume 10 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, Another Self Portrait (1969\u20131971) was released in August 2013.[322] The album contained 35 previously unreleased tracks, including alternative takes and demos from Dylan's 1969\u20131971 recording sessions during the making of the Self Portrait and New Morning albums. The box set also included a live recording of Dylan's performance with the Band at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969. Another Self Portrait received favorable reviews, earning a score of 81 on the critical aggregator, Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"[323] AllMusic critic Thom Jurek wrote, \"For fans, this is more than a curiosity, it's an indispensable addition to the catalog.\"[324]\nColumbia Records released a boxed set containing all 35 Dylan studio albums, six albums of live recordings, and a collection, entitled Sidetracks, of non-album material, Bob Dylan: Complete Album Collection: Vol. One, in November 2013..[325][326] To publicize the 35 album box set, an innovative video of the song \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was released on Dylan's website. The interactive video, created by director Vania Heymann, allowed viewers to switch between 16 simulated TV channels, all featuring characters who are lip-synching the lyrics of the 48-year-old song.[327][328]\nDylan appeared in a commercial for the Chrysler 200 car which was screened during the 2014 Super Bowl American football game played on February 2, 2014. At the end of the commercial, Dylan says: \"So let Germany brew your beer, let Switzerland make your watch, let Asia assemble your phone. We will build your car.\" Dylan's Super Bowl commercial generated controversy and op-ed pieces discussing the protectionist implications of his words, and whether the singer had \"sold out\" to corporate interests.[329][330][331][332][333]\nIn 2013 and 2014, auction house sales demonstrated the high cultural value attached to Dylan's mid-1960s work and the record prices that collectors were willing to pay for artefacts from this period. In December 2013, the Fender Stratocaster which Dylan had played at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival fetched $965,000, the second highest price paid for a guitar.[334][335] In June 2014, Dylan's hand-written lyrics of \"Like a Rolling Stone\", his 1965 hit single, fetched $2 million dollars at auction, a record for a popular music manuscript.[336][337]\nA massive 960 page, thirteen and a half pound edition of Dylan's lyrics, The Lyrics: Since 1962 was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in the fall of 2014. The book was edited by literary critic Christopher Ricks, Julie Nemrow and Lisa Nemrow, to offer variant versions of Dylan's songs, sourced from out-takes and live performances. A limited edition of 50 books, signed by Dylan, was priced at $5,000. \"It's the biggest, most expensive book we've ever published, as far as I know,\" said Jonathan Karp, Simon &amp; Schuster's president and publisher.[338][339]\nA comprehensive edition of the Basement Tapes song recorded by Dylan and the Band in 1967 was released as The Basement Tapes Complete in November 2014. These 138 tracks in a six-CD box form Volume 11 of Dylan's Bootleg Series. The 1975 album, The Basement Tapes, had contained just 24 tracks from the material which Dylan and the Band had recorded at their homes in Woodstock, New York in 1967. Subsequently, over 100 recordings and alternate takes had circulated on bootleg records. The sleeve notes for the new box set are by Sid Griffin, author of Million Dollar Bash: Bob Dylan, the Band, and the Basement Tapes.[340][341]\nIn February 2015, Dylan released Shadows in the Night, featuring ten songs written between 1923 and 1963,[342][343] which have been described as part of the Great American Songbook.[344] All the songs on the album were recorded by Frank Sinatra but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of \"Sinatra covers.\"[342][345] Dylan explained, \"I don't see myself as covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day.\"[346] In an interview, Dylan said he had been thinking about making this record since hearing Willie Nelson's 1978 album Stardust.[347] Dylan's first foray into this material was in 2001 when he recorded Dean Martin's \"Return to Me\" for the third season of The Sopranos.[348]\nShadows In the Night received favorable reviews, scoring 82 on the critical aggregator Metacritic, which indicates \"universal acclaim\".[349] Critics praised the restrained instrumental backings and the quality of Dylan's singing.[344][350] Bill Prince in GQ commented: \"A performer who's had to hear his influence in virtually every white pop recording made since he debuted his own self-titled album back in 1962 imagines himself into the songs of his pre-rock'n'roll early youth.\"[345] The album debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release.[351]\nThe Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965\u20131966, consisting of previously unreleased material from the three albums Dylan recorded between January 1965 and March 1966: Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde was released in November 2015. The set was released in three formats: a 2-CD \"Best Of\" version, a 6-CD \"Deluxe edition\", and an 18-CD \"Collector's Edition\" in a limited edition of 5,000 units. On Dylan's website the \"Collector's Edition\" was described as containing \"every single note recorded by Bob Dylan in the studio in 1965/1966.\"[352][353] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded Cutting Edge a score of 99, indicating universal acclaim.[354] The Best of the Cutting Edge entered the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart at number one on November 18, based on its first-week sales.[355]\nThe sale of Dylan's extensive archive of about 6,000 items of memorabilia to the George Kaiser Family Foundation and the University of Tulsa was announced on March 2, 2016. It was reported the sale price was \"an estimated $15 million to $20 million\". The archive comprises notebooks, drafts of Dylan lyrics, recordings, and correspondence.[356] The archive will be housed at Helmerich Center for American Research, a facility at the Gilcrease Museum.[357]\nDylan released Fallen Angels\u2014described as \"a direct continuation of the work of 'uncovering' the Great Songbook that he began on last year's Shadows In the Night\"\u2014in May.[358] The album contained twelve songs by classic songwriters such as Harold Arlen, Sammy Cahn and Johnny Mercer, eleven of which had been recorded by Sinatra.[358] Jim Farber wrote in Entertainment Weekly: \"Tellingly, [Dylan] delivers these songs of love lost and cherished not with a burning passion but with the wistfulness of experience. They're memory songs now, intoned with a present sense of commitment. Released just four days ahead of his 75th birthday, they couldn't be more age-appropriate.\"[359] The album received a score of 79 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, denoting \"generally favorable reviews\".[360]\nA massive 36-CD collection, The 1966 Live Recordings, including every known recording of Bob Dylan's 1966 concert tour was released in November 2016.[361] The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the Royal Albert Hall concert in London on May 27.[362][363] The New York Times reported most of the concerts had \"never been heard in any form\", and described the set as \"a monumental addition to the corpus\".[364]\nDylan released a triple album of a further 30 recordings of classic American songs, Triplicate, in March 2017. Dylan's 38th studio album was recorded in Hollywood's Capitol Studios and features his touring band.[365] Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. \"Nostalgic? No I wouldn't say that. It's not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for the good old days or fond memories of what's no more. A song like \"Sentimental Journey\" is not a way back when song, it doesn't emulate the past, it's attainable and down to earth, it's in the here and now.\"[366] The album was awarded a score of 84 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, signifying \"universal acclaim\". Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the great American songbook, though, in the opinion of Uncut: \"For all its easy charms, Triplicate labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums' worth of croon toons, this feels like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter.\"[367]\nThe next edition of Dylan's Bootleg Series revisited Dylan's \"Born Again\" Christian period of 1979 to 1981, which was described by Rolling Stone as \"an intense, wildly controversial time that produced three albums and some of the most confrontational concerts of his long career\".[368] Reviewing the box set, The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979\u20131981, comprising 8 CDs and 1 DVD.[368] in The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote, \"Decades later, what comes through these recordings above all is Mr. Dylan's unmistakable fervor, his sense of mission. The studio albums are subdued, even tentative, compared with what the songs became on the road. Mr. Dylan's voice is clear, cutting and ever improvisational; working the crowds, he was emphatic, committed, sometimes teasingly combative. And the band tears into the music.\"[369] Trouble No More includes a DVD of a film directed by Jennifer Lebeau consisting of live footage of Dylan's gospel performances interspersed with sermons delivered by actor Michael Shannon. The box set album received an aggregate score of 84 on the critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[370]\nDylan made a contribution to the compilation EP Universal Love, a collection of reimagined wedding songs for the LGBT community in April 2018.[371] The album was funded by MGM Resorts International and the songs are intended to function as \"wedding anthems for same-sex couples\".[372] Dylan recorded the 1929 song \"She's Funny That Way\", changing the gender pronoun to \"He's Funny That Way\". The song has previously been recorded by Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra.[372][373]\nAlso in April 2018, The New York Times announced that Dylan was launching Heaven's Door, a range of three whiskeys: a straight rye, a straight bourbon and a \"double-barreled\" whiskey. Dylan has been involved in both the creation and the marketing of the range. The Times described the venture as \"Mr. Dylan's entry into the booming celebrity-branded spirits market, the latest career twist for an artist who has spent five decades confounding expectations.\"[374]\nOn November 2, 2018, Dylan released More Blood, More Tracks as Volume 14 in the Bootleg Series. The set comprises all Dylan's recordings for his 1975 album Blood On the Tracks, and was issued as a single CD and also as a six-CD Deluxe Edition.[375] The box set album received an aggregate score of 93 on the critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[376]\nNetflix released the movie Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese on June 12, 2019, describing the film as \"Part documentary, part concert film, part fever dream\".[377][183] The Scorsese film received an aggregate score of 88 on critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[378] The film sparked controversy because of the way it deliberately mixed documentary footage filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue in the fall of 1975 with fictitious characters and invented stories.[379]\nCoinciding with the film release, a box set of 14 CDs, The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings, was released by Columbia Records. The set comprises five full Dylan performances from the tour and recently discovered tapes from Dylan's tour rehearsals.[380] The box set received an aggregate score of 89 on the critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[381]\nThe next instalment of Dylan's Bootleg Series, Bob Dylan (featuring Johnny Cash) \u2013 Travelin\u2019 Thru, 1967 \u2013 1969: The Bootleg Series Vol. 15, was released on November 1. The 3-CD set comprises outtakes from Dylan's albums John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline, and songs that Dylan recorded with Johnny Cash in Nashville in 1969 and with Earl Scruggs in 1970.[382][383] Travelin' Thru received an aggregate score of 88 on the critical website Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[384]\nThe Never Ending Tour commenced on June 7, 1988,[385] and Dylan has played roughly 100 dates a year for the entirety of the 1990s and 2000s\u2014a heavier schedule than most performers who started out in the 1960s.[386] By April 2019, Dylan and his band had played more than 3,000 shows,[387] anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier, multi-instrumentalist Donnie Herron and guitarist Charlie Sexton.[388] In October 2019, drummer Matt Chamberlain joined the band.[388] To the dismay of some of his audience,[389] Dylan's performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach night after night.[390] Critical opinion about Dylan's shows remains divided. Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material.[391][392] Others have criticized his live performances for mangling and spitting out \"the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable\", and giving so little to the audience that \"it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all.\"[393]\nDylan's performances in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised him for not making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list.[394][395] Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed.[396][397] In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: \"As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for the names of the songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play.\"[398]\nIn 2019, Dylan undertook two tours in Europe. The first commenced in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, on March 31, and ended in Valencia, Spain, on May 7. He played his 3000th show of the Never Ending Tour on April 19, 2019, in Innsbruck, Austria.[399] Dylan's second tour began in Bergen, Norway, on June 21, and ended in Kilkenny, Ireland, on July 14.[400][401] In the fall of 2019 Dylan toured the USA, commencing in Irvine, California on October 11 and ending in Washington D.C. on December 8.[402]\nIn October 2019, Dylan's touring company indicated that he would play 14 concerts in Japan in April 2020.[403]\nThe cover of Dylan's album Self Portrait (1970) is a reproduction of a painting of a face by Dylan.[404] Another of his paintings is reproduced on the cover of the 1974 album Planet Waves. In 1994 Random House published Drawn Blank, a book of Dylan's drawings.[405] In 2007, the first public exhibition of Dylan's paintings, The Drawn Blank Series, opened at the Kunstsammlungen in Chemnitz, Germany;[406] it showcased more than 200 watercolors and gouaches made from the original drawings. The exhibition coincided with the publication of Bob Dylan: The Drawn Blank Series, which includes 170 reproductions from the series.[406][407] From September 2010 until April 2011, the National Gallery of Denmark exhibited 40 large-scale acrylic paintings by Dylan, The Brazil Series.[408]\nIn July 2011, a leading contemporary art gallery, Gagosian Gallery, announced their representation of Dylan's paintings.[409] An exhibition of Dylan's art, The Asia Series, opened at the Gagosian Madison Avenue Gallery on September 20, displaying Dylan's paintings of scenes in China and the Far East.[410] The New York Times reported that \"some fans and Dylanologists have raised questions about whether some of these paintings are based on the singer's own experiences and observations, or on photographs that are widely available and were not taken by Mr. Dylan.\" The Times pointed to close resemblances between Dylan's paintings and historic photos of Japan and China, and photos taken by Dmitri Kessel and Henri Cartier-Bresson.[411] Art critic Blake Gopnik has defended Dylan's artistic practice, arguing: \"Ever since the birth of photography, painters have used it as the basis for their works: Edgar Degas and Edouard Vuillard and other favorite artists\u2014even Edvard Munch\u2014all took or used photos as sources for their art, sometimes barely altering them.\"[412] The Magnum photo agency confirmed that Dylan had licensed the reproduction rights of these photographs.[413]\nDylan's second show at the Gagosian Gallery, Revisionist Art, opened in November 2012. The show consisted of thirty paintings, transforming and satirizing popular magazines, including Playboy and Babytalk.[414][415] In February 2013, Dylan exhibited the New Orleans Series of paintings at the Palazzo Reale in Milan.[416] In August 2013, Britain's National Portrait Gallery in London hosted Dylan's first major UK exhibition, Face Value, featuring twelve pastel portraits.[417]\nIn November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an exhibition in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement released by the gallery, Dylan said, \"I've been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference.\"[418][419]\nIn November 2016, the Halcyon Gallery featured a collection of drawings, watercolors and acrylic works by Dylan. The exhibition, The Beaten Path, depicted American landscapes and urban scenes, inspired by Dylan's travels across the USA.[420] The show was reviewed by Vanity Fair and Asia Times Online.[421][422][423] In October 2018, the Halcyon Gallery mounted an exhibition of Dylan's drawings, Mondo Scripto. The works consisted of Dylan hand-written lyrics of his songs, with each song illustrated by a drawing.[424]\nSince 1994, Dylan has published eight books of paintings and drawings.[425]\nDylan has published Tarantula, a work of prose poetry; Chronicles: Volume One, the first part of his memoirs; several books of the lyrics of his songs, and eight books of his art. He has also been the subject of numerous biographies and critical studies.\nDylan's first serious relationship was with artist Suze Rotolo, a daughter of American Communist Party radicals. According to Dylan, \"She was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen... The air was suddenly filled with banana leaves. We started talking and my head started to spin.\"[426] Rotolo was photographed arm-in-arm with Dylan on the cover of his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Critics have connected Rotolo to some of Dylan's early love songs, including \"Don't Think Twice It's All Right.\" The relationship ended in 1964.[427] In 2008, Rotolo published a memoir about her life in Greenwich Village and relationship with Dylan in the 1960s, A Freewheelin' Time.[428]\nWhen Joan Baez first met Dylan in April 1961, she had already released her first album and was acclaimed as the \"Queen of Folk.\"[429] On hearing Dylan perform his song \"With God on Our Side,\" Baez later said, \"I never thought anything so powerful could come out of that little toad.\"[430] In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets over the next two years.[431] By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the U.K, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back.[431] Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975\u201376, and sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue. Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special Hard Rain, filmed at Fort Collins, Colorado, in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman In White' in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 with Carlos Santana.[431]\nBaez recalled her relationship with Dylan in Martin Scorsese's documentary film No Direction Home (2005). Baez wrote about Dylan in two autobiographies\u2014admiringly in Daybreak (1968), and less admiringly in And A Voice to Sing With (1987). Baez's relationship with Dylan is the subject of her song \"Diamonds &amp; Rust\", which has been described as \"an acute portrait\" of Dylan.[431]\nDylan married Sara Lownds, who had worked as a model and a secretary to Drew Associates, on November 22, 1965.[432] Their first child, Jesse Byron Dylan, was born on January 6, 1966, and they had three more children: Anna Lea (born July 11, 1967), Samuel Isaac Abram (born July 30, 1968), and Jakob Luke (born December 9, 1969). Dylan also adopted Sara's daughter from a prior marriage, Maria Lownds (later Dylan, born October 21, 1961). Sara Dylan played the role of Clara in Dylan's film Renaldo and Clara (1978). Bob and Sara Dylan were divorced on June 29, 1977.[432]\nMaria married musician Peter Himmelman in 1988.[433] Jakob became well known as the lead singer of the band the Wallflowers in the 1990s.[434]  Jesse is a film director and business executive.[435]\nDylan married his backup singer Carolyn Dennis (often professionally known as Carol Dennis) on June 4, 1986. Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, their daughter, was born on January 31, 1986.[436] The couple divorced in October 1992. Their marriage and child remained a closely guarded secret until the publication of Howard Sounes' biography Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan, in 2001.[437]\nWhen not touring, Dylan is believed to live primarily in Point Dume, a promontory on the coast of Malibu, California, though he also owns property around the world.[438][439]\nGrowing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small, close-knit Jewish community and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah.[440][13] Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League.[441]\nDuring the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship.[197] Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\"[442][443] From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.[197][444]\nBy 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \"born again\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.\" [445]\nIn 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek:\nHere's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like \"Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain\" or \"I Saw the Light\"\u2014that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.[446]\nIn an interview published in The New York Times on September 28, 1997, journalist Jon Pareles reported that \"Dylan says he now subscribes to no organized religion.\"[447]\nDylan has supported the Chabad Lubavitch movement,[448] and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including the Bar Mitzvahs of his sons and attending Hadar Hatorah, a Chabad Lubavitch yeshiva. In September 1989 and September 1991, he appeared on the Chabad telethon.[449] On Yom Kippur in 2007 he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was called to the Torah for the sixth aliyah.[450]\nDylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has also made passing references to his religious faith\u2014such as in a 2004 interview with 60 Minutes, when he told Ed Bradley that \"the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God.\" He also explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the \"chief commander\u2014in this earth and in the world we can't see.\"[28]\nIn a 2009 interview with Bill Flanagan promoting Dylan's Christmas LP, Christmas in the Heart, Flanagan commented on the \"heroic performance\" Dylan gave of \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" and that he \"delivered the song like a true believer.\" Dylan replied: \"Well, I am a true believer.\"[307]\nDylan has won many awards throughout his career including the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, ten Grammy Awards,[451] one Academy Award and one Golden Globe Award. He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In May 2000, Dylan received the Polar Music Prize from Sweden's King Carl XVI.[452]\nIn June 2007, Dylan received the Prince of Asturias Award in the Arts category.[453] Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in May 2012.[454][455] In February 2015, Dylan accepted the MusiCares Person of the Year award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, in recognition of his philanthropic and artistic contributions to society.[456] In November 2013, Dylan received the accolade of L\u00e9gion d'Honneur from the French education minister Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti.[457]\nThe Nobel Prize committee announced on October 13, 2016, that it would be awarding Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"[4][458] The New York Times reported: \"Mr. Dylan, 75, is the first musician to win the award, and his selection on Thursday is perhaps the most radical choice in a history stretching back to 1901.\"[459]\nA member of the Swedish Academy, Per W\u00e4stberg, called Dylan \"impolite and arrogant\" for ignoring the Nobel Committee's attempts to contact him.[460] Academy permanent secretary Sara Danius responded, \"The Swedish Academy has never held a view on a prizewinner's decision in this context, neither will it now.\"[461] After two weeks of speculation about Dylan's silence concerning the Nobel Prize,[462] he said in an interview with Edna Gundersen that getting the award was: \"amazing, incredible. Whoever dreams about something like that?\"[463]\nThe Swedish Academy announced in November that Dylan would not travel to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize Ceremony due to \"pre-existing commitments.\"[464] At the Nobel Banquet in Stockholm on December 10, 2016, Dylan's speech was given by Azita Raji, U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. Patti Smith accepted Dylan's Nobel and performed his song \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" to orchestral accompaniment.[465]\nOn April 2, 2017, Academy secretary Danius reported: \"Earlier today the Swedish Academy met with Bob Dylan for a private ceremony [with no media present] in Stockholm, during which Dylan received his gold medal and diploma. Twelve members of the Academy were present. Spirits were high. Champagne was had. Quite a bit of time was spent looking closely at the gold medal, in particular the beautifully crafted back, an image of a young man sitting under a laurel tree who listens to the Muse. Taken from Virgil's Aeneid, the inscription reads: Inventas vitam iuvat excoluisse per artes, loosely translated as \"And they who bettered life on earth by their newly found mastery.\"[466]\nDylan's Nobel Lecture was posted on the Nobel prize website on June 5, 2017.[467] The New York Times pointed out that, in order to collect the prize's eight million Swedish krona ($900,000), the Swedish Academy's rules stipulate the laureate \"must deliver a lecture within six months of the official ceremony, which would have made Mr. Dylan's deadline June 10.\"[468] Academy secretary Danius commented: \"The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close.\"[469] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: \"Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, 'Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story'.\"[470]\nDylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century, where he was called \"master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation.\"[471] In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\"[472]\nPresident Barack Obama said of Dylan in 2012, \"There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music.\"[317] For 20 years, academics lobbied the Swedish Academy to give Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature.[473][474][475][476] He received the award in 2016,[459] making Dylan the first musician to be awarded the Literature Prize.[459] Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, described Dylan's place in literary history:\n...a singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards.[477]\nRolling Stone has ranked Dylan at number one in its 2015 list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time,[478] and listed \"Like A Rolling Stone\" as the \"Greatest Song of all Time\" in their 2011 list.[479] In 2008, it was estimated that Dylan had sold about 120 million albums worldwide.[480]\nInitially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie,[481] the blues of Robert Johnson,[482] and what he termed the \"architectural forms\" of Hank Williams songs,[483] Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry.\"[484] Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: \"[Dylan's] early songs were very rich\u00a0... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while.\"[485]\nWhen Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to a rock backing, the mix became more complex. For many critics, his greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-1960s trilogy of albums\u2014Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde. In Mike Marqusee's words:\nBetween late 1964 and the middle of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&amp;B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, symbolist, modernist and Beat poetry, surrealism and Dada, advertising jargon and social commentary, Fellini and Mad magazine, he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console.[486]\nDylan's lyrics began to receive detailed scrutiny from academics and poets as early as 1998, when Stanford University sponsored the first international academic conference on Bob Dylan to be held in the United States.[487] In 2004, Richard F. Thomas, Classics professor at Harvard University, created a freshman seminar titled \"Dylan\" \"to put the artist in context of not just popular culture of the last half-century, but the tradition of classical poets like Virgil and Homer.\"[488]\nLiterary critic Christopher Ricks published Dylan's Visions of Sin, a 500-page analysis of Dylan's work,[489] and has said: \"I'd not have written a book about Dylan, to stand alongside my books on Milton and Keats, Tennyson and T.S. Eliot, if I didn't think Dylan a genius of and with language.[490] Former British poet laureate Andrew Motion suggested his lyrics should be studied in schools.[491] The critical consensus that Dylan's song writing was his outstanding creative achievement was articulated by Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica where his entry stated: \"Hailed as the Shakespeare of his generation, Dylan... set the standard for lyric writing.\"[492]\nDylan's voice also received critical attention. Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as \"a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk's.\"[493] David Bowie, in his tribute, \"Song for Bob Dylan\", described Dylan's singing as \"a voice like sand and glue.\" His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on \"Like a Rolling Stone\" as \"at once young and jeeringly cynical.\"[494] As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal Oral Tradition, \"Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs\u2014this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in \"Everything is Broken\" (on the album Oh Mercy) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality.\"[495]\nDylan is considered a seminal influence on many musical genres. As Edna Gundersen stated in USA Today: \"Dylan's musical DNA has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since 1962.\"[496] Punk musician Joe Strummer praised Dylan for having \"laid down the template for lyric, tune, seriousness, spirituality, depth of rock music.\"[497] Other major musicians who acknowledged Dylan's importance include Johnny Cash,[498] Jerry Garcia,[499] John Lennon,[500] Paul McCartney,[501] Pete Townshend,[502] Neil Young,[503] Bruce Springsteen,[3] David Bowie,[504] Bryan Ferry,[505] Nick Cave,[506][507] Patti Smith,[508] Syd Barrett,[509] Joni Mitchell,[510] Tom Waits[511] and Leonard Cohen.[512] Dylan significantly contributed to the initial success of both the Byrds and the Band: the Byrds achieved chart success with their version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and the subsequent album, while the Band were Dylan's backing band on his 1966 tour, recorded The Basement Tapes with him in 1967[513] and featured three previously unreleased Dylan songs on their debut album.[514]\nSome critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom, Nik Cohn objected: \"I can't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as everything else he's been worshipped as. The way I see him, he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype.\"[515] Australian critic Jack Marx credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: \"What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since, with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem educating themselves from the Dylan handbook.\"[516]\nFellow musicians have also presented dissenting views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a \"plagiarist\" and his voice as \"fake\" in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times, despite the fact that Mitchell had toured with Dylan in the past, and both artists have covered each others songs.[517][518] Mitchell's comment led to discussions of Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing him.[519] Talking to Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of Henry Timrod's verse in his album Modern Times,[276] by saying that it was \"part of the tradition.\"[520][a 5]\nIf Dylan's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music,[486] critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. Following the release of Todd Haynes' Dylan biopic I'm Not There, J. Hoberman wrote in his 2007 Village Voice review:\nElvis might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then\u2014having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning\u2014vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.[521]\nWhen Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, The New York Times commented: \"In choosing a popular musician for the literary world's highest honor, the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, dramatically redefined the boundaries of literature, setting off a debate about whether song lyrics have the same artistic value as poetry or novels.\"[459] Responses varied from the sarcasm of Irvine Welsh, who described it as \"an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies\",[522] to the enthusiasm of Salman Rushdie who tweeted: \"From Orpheus to Faiz, song &amp; poetry have been closely linked. Dylan is the brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition. Great choice.\"[523]\nDylan's archive, comprising notebooks, song drafts, business contracts, recordings and movie out-takes, is held at the Gilcrease Museum's Helmerich Center for American Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is also the home of the papers of Woody Guthrie.[356][524] In 2017, the George Kaiser Family Foundation announced a design competition for a major Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa's Arts District.[525][526] In 2018, the foundation announced that it had selected Olson Kundig Architects to design the building.[527] The center is expected to open in 2021, and be located next to the facility dedicated to Guthrie.[528]\nIn 2005, 7th Avenue East in Hibbing, Minnesota, the street on which Dylan lived from ages 6 to 18, received the honorary name Bob Dylan Drive.[529][530][531] In the town Hibbing, a walk of fame-styled \"star\" is embedded in a sidewalk with the words Bob Dylan as well as a cursive-Z for Dylan's nickname Zimmy in youth.[532] In 2006 a cultural pathway, Bob Dylan Way, was inaugurated in Duluth, Minnesota, the city where Dylan was born. The 1.8 mile path links \"cultural and historically significant areas of downtown for the tourists.\"[533][534]\nIn 2015, a massive Bob Dylan mural was unveiled in downtown Minneapolis, the city where Dylan attended university for a year. The mural was designed by Brazilian street artist Eduardo Kobra.[535]\n\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nBrian Harold May, CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. His songs include \"We Will Rock You\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\", \"I Want It All\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"Flash\", \"Hammer to Fall\", \"Save Me\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" and \"The Show Must Go On\". May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, having previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album A Night at the Opera and its single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special.[3] Following the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the 1992 tribute concert, the release of Made in Heaven (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the seventh greatest guitarist of all time.[4] He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".[5] In 2012, he was ranked the second greatest guitarist in a Guitar World magazine readers poll.[6] In 2001, May was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Queen and in 2018 the band received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[7] May was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for \"services to the music industry and for charity work\".[8] May earned a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007,[1][2] and was Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 2008 to 2013.[9] He was a \"science team collaborator\" with NASA's New Horizons Pluto mission.[10][11] He is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign Asteroid Day.[12] Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him. May is also an animal rights activist, campaigning against the hunting of foxes and the culling of badgers in the UK.[13] Brian Harold May was born 19 July 1947[14] in Hampton, Middlesex,[15] the only child of Ruth Irving (Fletcher) and Harold May, who worked as a draughtsman at the Ministry of Aviation.[16][17] His mother was Scottish, while his father was English.[18] May attended the local Hampton Grammar School, then a voluntary aided school.[15][16][19] During this time, he formed his first band, named 1984 after George Orwell's novel of the same name, with vocalist and bassist Tim Staffell.[20] At Hampton Grammar School, he attained ten GCE Ordinary Levels and three GCE Advanced Levels in Physics, Mathematics, and Applied Mathematics.[20] He studied Mathematics and Physics at Imperial College London, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 1968 with honours.[21][22] In 2007, May was awarded a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London for work started in 1971 and completed in 2007.[1][2][23] May formed the band Smile in 1968. The group included Tim Staffell as the lead singer and bassist, and later, drummer Roger Taylor, who also went on to play for Queen. The band lasted for only two years, from 1968 to 1970, as Staffell departed in 1970, leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs. Smile would reunite for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band The Cross were headliners, and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".[24] May also performed several other songs that night. In Queen's three-part vocal harmonies, May was generally the lower-range backing vocalist. On some of his songs, he sings the lead vocals, most notably the first verse of \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", the final verse of \"Mother Love\", the middle eight on \"I Want It All\" and \"Flash's Theme\", and full lead vocals on \"Some Day One Day\", \"She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilettoes)\", \"'39\", \"Good Company\", \"Long Away\", \"All Dead, All Dead\", \"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\", \"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\".[25] May frequently wrote songs for the band and has composed many hits such as \"We Will Rock You\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\", \"I Want It All\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" and \"The Show Must Go On\" as well as \"Hammer to Fall\", \"Flash\", \"Now I'm Here\", \"Brighton Rock\", \"The Prophet's Song\", \"Las Palabras de Amor\", \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\" and \"Save Me\".[26] After the Live Aid concert in 1985, Mercury rang his band members and proposed writing a song together. The result was \"One Vision\", which was basically May on music (the Magic Years documentary shows how he came up with the opening section and the basic guitar riff) and the lyrics were co-written by all four band members.[27] For their 1989 release album, The Miracle, the band had decided that all of the tracks would be credited to the entire band, no matter who had been the main writer.[28] Still, interviews and musical analyses tend to help identify the input of each member on each track. May composed \"I Want It All\" for that album, as well as \"Scandal\" (based on his personal problems with the British press). For the rest of the album he did not contribute so much creatively, although he helped in building the basis of \"Party\" and \"Was It All Worth It\" (both being predominantly Mercury's pieces) and created the guitar riff of \"Chinese Torture\".[28] Queen's subsequent album was Innuendo, on which May's contributions increased, although more in arrangements than actual writing in most cases; for the title track he did some of the arrangement for the heavy solo, then he added vocal harmonies to \"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" and composed the solo of \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\", a song for which the four of them decided the keyboard parts together.[29] Two songs that May had composed for his first solo album, \"Headlong\" and \"I Can't Live With You\", eventually ended up in the Queen project. His other composition was \"The Show Must Go On\", a group effort in which he was the coordinator and primary composer.[30] In recent years, he has supervised the remastering of Queen albums and various DVD and greatest hits releases. In 2004, he announced that he and drummer Roger Taylor were going on tour for the first time in 18\u00a0years as \"Queen\", along with Free/Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers. Billed as \"Queen + Paul Rodgers\", the band played throughout 2005 and 2006 in South Africa, Europe, Aruba, Japan, and North America and released a new album with Paul Rodgers in 2008, entitled The Cosmos Rocks. This album was supported by a major tour.[31] Paul Rodgers then left the band[32] in May 2009 and it wasn't until 2011 that another vocalist, Adam Lambert,[33] was recruited. They subsequently went on a 2012 European Tour, a world tour over 2014 and 2015 and, most recently, 2016 Festival Tour. They also played the Big Ben New Year concert on New Year's Eve 2014 and New Year's Day 2015.[34] During 1983, several members of Queen explored side projects. On 21 and 22 April in Los Angeles, May was in the studio with Eddie Van Halen, with no intentions of recording anything; the result of those days was a mini album entitled Star Fleet Project, which originally wasn't going to be released. In 1986, May contributed to former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett's album Feedback 86, playing guitar on the track \"Cassandra\" and providing guitar and vocals for \"Slot Machine,\" the latter co-written by May. Although produced in 1986, the album was not issued as a commercial release until 2000. In the same year, May worked with actress Anita Dobson on her first album, most noted for the song \"Anyone Can Fall in Love\", which added lyrics to the EastEnders theme tune and reached no. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1986. May and Dobson would go on to marry in 2000.[35] In 1988, May contributed guitar solos to the song \"When Death Calls\" on Black Sabbath's 14th album Headless Cross, and the Living in a Box track \"Blow The House Down\" from the album Gatecrashing.[36] Both albums were released in 1989. \u00a0\u2014Joe Satriani[37] In the aftermath of the November 1991 death of Mercury, May chose to deal with his grief by committing himself as fully as possible to work, first by finishing his solo album, Back to the Light,[38] and then touring worldwide to promote it. He frequently remarked in press interviews that this was the only form of self-prescribed therapy he could think of.[39] According to Def Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott, \"It was undoubtedly an enormous and terrible blow to lose someone he was so close to. Personally, I know it ripped the heart out of Brian, but having said that, he was in great spirits after the album was finished.\"[37] Back to the Light featured the single \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\", on which he collaborated as a songwriter with Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers. A version with Freddie Mercury's vocals was later released on the Queen album Made in Heaven and won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically & Lyrically in 1996.[40] In late 1992, the Brian May Band was officially formed. An earlier version of the band was loosely formed for 19 October 1991, the date of the band's last concert of reunion, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in Seville, Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, Cozy Powell on drums and percussion, Mike Moran and Rick Wakeman on keyboards, and Maggie Ryder, Miriam Stockley and Chris Thompson on backing vocals. The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, Michael Casswell on guitar, Neil Murray on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band lasted only during the South American support tour (supporting The B-52's and Joe Cocker) on only five dates.[41] Afterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist Jamie Moses on board to replace Mike Caswell. The other change made was in the backing vocals department, when Ryder, Stockley and Thompson were replaced with Catherine Porter and Shelley Preston. On 23 February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting Guns N' Roses and headlining a few dates.[42] The tour would take them through North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18 December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and John Deacon to work on tracks that became Made in Heaven, the final Queen studio album.[43] The band took Mercury's solo album demos and last recordings, which he managed to perform in the studio after the album Innuendo was finished, and completed them with their additions both musically and vocally.[44] Work on the album after Mercury's death originally began in 1992 by Deacon and May, but was left until a later date, due to other commitments.[43] In 1995, May began working towards a new solo album of covers tentatively named Heroes, in addition to working on various film and television projects[45] and other collaborations. May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included Another World, and featured mainly Spike Edney, Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5 April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the M4 motorway near Bristol, England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band, with a new drummer being needed at short notice. Steve Ferrone was brought on to help May finish recording drums and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, Eric Singer replaced Steve Ferrone for the full 1998 world tour. The 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway. Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a teddy boy crooner) would play a number of 1950s rock and roll standards prior to May's 'arrival'. A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled Retro Rock Special was attached to some pressings of the Another World album. The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.[46] In May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on Chinese Democracy, however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.[47] From his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor. On 22 October 2000, he made a guest appearance at the Mot\u00f6rhead 25th Anniversary show at Brixton Academy along with Eddie Clarke (former Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist) for the encore song \"Overkill\". As part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II celebrations on 3 June 2002, May performed a guitar solo of \"God Save the Queen\" from the roof of Buckingham Palace, with the performance appearing on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of A Night at the Opera.[48][49] In 2004, May played guitar on the song \"Someone to Die For\" on the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack.[50] In the Queen's birthday honours list of 2005, he was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire \"for services to the music industry and for charity work\".[51] In the same year he played the guitar in the song Il mare... of the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari, in his album Zu & Co., and he took part in the concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London held in May 2004, with the other guests of the Italian bluesman. May was a celebrity guest at the Genesis reunion concert at Twickenham Stadium in 2007.[52] May and Genesis frontman Phil Collins had worked together on two previous occasions, at The Prince's Trust Rock Gala in 1988 and the Party at the Palace in 2002, when Collins had played drums with Queen. In 2011 he contributed to a feature about Collins for FHM, praising him as \"a great guy and an amazing drummer\".[53] May worked extensively with stage actress and singer Kerry Ellis after he cast her in the musical We Will Rock You. He produced and arranged her debut studio album Anthems (2010), a follow-up to her extended play Wicked in Rock (2008), as well as appearing with Ellis at many public performances\u00a0\u2013 playing guitar alongside her. He also contributed a guitar solo to Meat Loaf's Hang Cool, Teddy Bear album in exchange for the use of drummer John Miceli. Along with Elena Vidal, Brian May released a historical book in 2009 entitled A Village Lost and Found: Scenes in Our Village.[54] The book is an annotated collection of stereoscopic photographs taken by the Victorian era photographer T. R. Williams and it is sold with a focusing stereoscope. May became an enthusiast of stereoscope photographs as a child, and first encountered the work of Williams during the late 1960s. In 2003, May announced a search to identify the actual location of the Scenes in Our Village images. In 2004 May reported that he had identified the location as the village of Hinton Waldrist in Oxfordshire.[55] On 20 May 2009, May and Queen bandmate Roger Taylor performed \"We Are the Champions\" live on the season finale of American Idol with winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert providing a vocal duet.[56] In November 2009, May appeared with Taylor on The X Factor, with Queen mentoring the contestants, then later performing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". In April 2010, May founded the \"Save Me\" 2010 project to work against any proposed repeal of the British fox-hunting ban, and also to promote animal rights in Britain.[57] In February 2011, it was announced that May would tour with Kerry Ellis, playing 12 dates across the UK in May 2011.[58] On 18 April 2011, Lady Gaga confirmed that May would play guitar on her track \"You and I\" from her latest album Born This Way, released on 23 May 2011.[59] May joined Gaga on stage during the performance of \"You and I\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards held at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles.[60] In June 2011, May performed with Tangerine Dream at the Starmus Festival on Tenerife, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's first spaceflight.[61] On 26 August, May performed \"We Will Rock You\" and \"Welcome to the Black Parade\" with rock band My Chemical Romance at the Reading Festival.[62] On 10 October, May made an appearance to celebrate the reunion of rock band The Darkness at an \"intimate\" 100 Club show with support from Dark Stares.[63][64] A long-time fan of the group, May performed three songs onstage with The Darkness, including Queen's \"Tie Your Mother Down\", at the Hammersmith Apollo on their subsequent \"comeback\" tour.[65][66] At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, Queen received the Global Icon Award, which Katy Perry presented to Brian May.[67] Queen closed the awards ceremony, with Adam Lambert on vocals, performing \"The Show Must Go On\", \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\".[67] The collaboration garnered a positive response from both fans and critics, resulting in speculation about future projects together.[68] Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012.[69][70] Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale.[71] A third London date was added for 14 July.[72] On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation.[73] Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic Stadium,[74][75] and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland.[76] In January 2012, May featured on N-Dubz frontman Dappy's solo single \"Rockstar\",[77] providing \"rumbling guitar riffs which culminate in an electrifying solo\".[78] The pair also collaborated on a performance of \"We Will Rock You\" for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.[79] On 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[80] May performed part of the \"Brighton Rock\" solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of \"We Will Rock You\".[80][81] On 16 September 2012, May appeared at the Sunflower Jam charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, performing alongside bassist John Paul Jones (of Led Zeppelin), drummer Ian Paice (of Deep Purple), and vocalists Bruce Dickinson (of Iron Maiden) and Alice Cooper.[82] May donated his guitar talent to the end credits song from the film, A Dog Named Gucci, in the song \"One Voice\", which also features the talents of Norah Jones, Aimee Mann, Susanna Hoffs, Lydia Loveless, Neko Case, and Kathryn Calder. It was produced by Dean Falcone, who also wrote the film's score. \"One Voice\" was released on Record Store Day, 16 April 2016, with profits from the sale of the single going to benefit animal charities.[83] At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \"featured with\" Queen as Queen + Paul Rodgers, not replacing the late Freddie Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.[84] Between 2005 and 2006 Queen and Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg being Europe and the second, Japan and the US in 2006.[85] On 25 May 2006, Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, and May and Taylor were joined on stage with the Foo Fighters to perform a selection of Queen songs.[85][86] On 15 August 2006, May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \"secret location\".[87] The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe and parts of the US, opening on Kharkiv's freedom square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans.[88] The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD.[88] Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up on 12 May 2009. Rodgers does not rule out the possibility of working together again.[89][90] Not long after performing with American Idol finalists Kris Allen and Adam Lambert during the programme's season finale in 2009, May and Taylor began contemplating the future of Queen after the group's amicable split with frontman Paul Rodgers. Two years later, at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Queen was presented that year's Global Icon Award, accepted by May. As part of the broadcast, Queen performed a short set with Lambert, receiving an overwhelmingly welcoming response.[68] Speculation regarding a collaboration with Lambert soon arose, with the three formally announcing a short summer tour of Europe in 2012, including three dates at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, as well as shows in Ukraine, Russia and Poland. As with the partnership with Paul Rodgers, John Deacon did not participate. The collaboration was revived in 2013, when the three performed together at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas on 20 September.[91] Five months later, May, Taylor and Lambert announced a 19-date summer tour of North America on Good Morning America.[92] Due to ticket demand, five dates were soon added.[93] In May 2014, shows in Australia[94] and New Zealand[95] were announced, along with festival performances in South Korea[96] and Japan.[97] The tour was extended to the UK and greater Europe in early 2015.[98] The group performed together in South America in September 2015, including Queen's first performance at the Rock in Rio Festival since 1985.[99] In 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day.[100] On 12 September they performed at the Park Hayarkon in Tel-Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people.[101] In September 2018 the group had a residency in the MGM Park Theater in Las Vegas.[102] Though the collaboration remains active, there are currently no plans of recording a studio album, though the three are willing to do so in the future.[103] On 29 March 2019, May inducted Def Leppard into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[104] In April 2019, he worked with contemporary metal band Five Finger Death Punch and country artist Kenny Wayne Shepherd to re-record a new version of \"Blue on Black\" in support of The Gary Sinise Foundation. The artists came together to merge country and mainstream rock to re-create the classic song originally co-written by Shepherd.[105] At the end of the month he also performed songs including \"All the Young Dudes\" with Def Leppard's Joe Elliott at a Mott the Hoople show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire.[106] \u00a0\u2014Steve Vai[107] \u00a0\u2014Andy Powell, Wishbone Ash[37] May has been referred to as a virtuoso guitarist by many publications and musicians.[108][109][110][111][112] He has featured in various music polls of great rock guitarists, and in 2011 was ranked number 26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".[5] In January 2007, the readers of Guitar World voted May's guitar solos on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Brighton Rock\" into the \"top 50 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time\" (No.20 and No.41 respectively).[113] Former Van Halen vocalist Sammy Hagar stated, \"I thought Queen were really innovative and made some great sounding records.. I like the rockin' stuff. I think Brian May has one of the great guitar tones on the planet, and I really, really love his guitar work.\"[112] Justin Hawkins, lead guitarist of The Darkness, cites May as his earliest influence, saying \"I really loved his tone and vibrato and everything. I thought his playing sounded like a singing voice. I wanted to be able to do that. Whenever I went to guitar lessons, I was always asking to learn Queen stuff.\"[114] American guitar virtuoso Steve Vai has spoken highly of May's work, saying:In that whole genre, in that whole period\u2014he's one of the most unique contributors. He doesn't get credit. Because what he does is so rich and so specific, and so deep, it fits so well in Queen music, you just feel it as part of that music. But when you break it down and when you look at it from a guitar player's point of view, it's unique, and nobody to this date could do what he does and make it sound like that. He is an iconic player. His tone, his choice of melody notes, he doesn't just do solos. His solos are melodies, and they're perfectly in place.[115]Most of May's electric guitar work live and in the studio is done on the Red Special, which he built with his father, an electronics engineer, when he was sixteen years old.[16][116][117][118][3][119] It was built with wood from an 18th-century fireplace, and was composed of household items such as mother-of-pearl buttons, shelf edging, and motorbike valve springs. While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.[120] These plans were eventually given to guitar luthier Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".[120] May commented on the Red Special: I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide. I lacquered the fingerboard with Rustin's Plastic Coating. The tremolo is interesting in that the arm's made from an old bicycle saddle bag carrier, the knob at the end's off a knitting needle and the springs are valve springs from an old motorbike.[121] In addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially a sixpence from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic plectrum, on the basis that their rigidity gives him more control in playing.[122] He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.[122] A meticulous arranger, he focuses on multi-part harmonies, often more contrapuntal than parallel \u2013 a relative rarity for rock guitar. Examples are found in Queen's albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races, where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"Teo Torriatte\"). May explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including sweep picking (\"Was It All Worth It\", \"Chinese Torture\"), tremolo (\"Brighton Rock\", \"Stone Cold Crazy\", \"Death on Two Legs\", \"Sweet Lady\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Get Down Make Love\", \"Dragon Attack\"), tapping (\"Bijou\", \"It's Late\", \"Resurrection\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"), slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"), Hendrix sounding licks (\"Liar\", \"Brighton Rock\"), tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\") and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Killer Queen\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by Freddie Mercury, who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from Queen II), \"Love of My Life\" and the skiffle-influenced \"'39\" (both from A Night at the Opera). Aided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"Procession\"; in \"Get Down, Make Love\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.[123] May also used his guitar to create the chime effect in \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".[124] May's early influences included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, who he says were \"the most metallic thing(s) out at the time.\" Many years later he gained his opportunity to play on separate occasions with both Cliff Richard and Shadows lead guitarist Hank Marvin. He has collaborated with Cliff Richard on a re-recording of the Cliff Richard and the Shadows (then known as the Drifters) 1958 hit \"Move It\" on the Cliff Richard duets album Two's Company which was released on 6 November 2006.[125] May always stated that the Beatles, Led Zeppelin,[126] the Who and Jimi Hendrix were the greatest influences on him. On the Queen for an Hour interview on BBC Radio\u00a01 in 1989, May listed Hendrix, Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton as his guitar heroes. In a 1991 interview for Guitar World magazine, May referred to the Who as \"my inspiration\", and on seeing Led Zeppelin stated, \"We used to look at those guys and think, 'That's the way it should be done.'\"[127] May told Guitarist in 2004: \"I don't think anyone has epitomised riff writing better than Jimmy Page \u2013 he's one of the great brains of rock music\".[128] May also cites Rory Gallagher as a major influence, saying \"He was a magician. He was one of the very few people of that time who could make his guitar do anything, it seemed. I remember looking at that battered Stratocaster and thinking, 'How does that (sound) come out of there?'\" According to May, \"...it was Rory that gave me my sound, and that's the sound I still have.\"[129] May was also influenced by Steve Hackett, guitarist of progressive rock band Genesis,[130] in particular his harmony guitar solo at the end of the band's epic 1971 song \"The Musical Box\".[131] Hackett said of May, \"Equally, his energetic approach to guitar inspired me.\"[132] From 1975 onwards, May had some replicas made of the Red Special, some of which were also used for live and recording purposes, others being mainly spares. The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May actually smashed it during a concert in the States in 1982), Greco BM90 (featured in the promo video of \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997\u20131998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton[133] (back-up from 2003 to present). On stage, May used to carry at least one back-up guitar (in case he broke a string) and occasionally would use others for certain songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company which makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar. He currently has a Guild 12-string to replace his Ovation Pacemaker. Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included: For acoustic, he favoured Ovation, Martin, T\u014dkai Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a Washburn RR2V on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986). In 1984, Guild released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300\u00a0guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000\u00a0copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence). \u00a0\u2014Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery on sharing a stage with May in the 1980s.[135] May has used Vox AC30 amplifiers almost exclusively since a meeting with his long-time hero Rory Gallagher at a gig in London during the late 1960s/early 1970s.[136] In the mid-1970s he used six of them, with an Echoplex delay (with extended delay time) plugged into a separate amplifier, and a second Echoplex plugged into yet another amp; he used a homemade booster, his only effects pedal, which was on all the time.[137] His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.[138] May also customises his amps by removing the circuitry for the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal), and this alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137\u00a0dB. He always used a treble booster which, along with the AC30 and his custom 'Deacy Amp' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.[139] He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to A Day at the Races. Effects designer Pete Cornish built for him the TB-83 (32\u00a0dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83. When performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14\u00a0AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay\u00a01, Delay\u00a02. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a BOSS pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"In The Lap of The Gods\" (Live at Wembley '86) or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.\u00a0Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\". As a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"Save Me\" and \"Flash\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"Let Me Live\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used Yamaha DX7 synths for the opening sequence of \"One Vision\" and the backgrounds of \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" (also on stage), \"Scandal\" and \"The Show Must Go On\". The first instrument May learned to play was the banjolele. He used a \"genuine George Formby Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"Bring Back That Leroy Brown\" and \"Good Company\". Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a Yamaha plastic piano in \"Teo Torriatte\" and a toy mini koto in \"The Prophet's Song\". May is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's Queen II to The Game, May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with Lee Holdridge, Il Colosso, for Steve Barron's 1996 film, The Adventures of Pinocchio. May performed the opera with Jerry Hadley, Sissel Kyrkjebo, and Just William. On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets. May studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and ARCS in physics with Upper Second-Class Honours. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a PhD[1] degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from interplanetary dust and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System. When Queen started to have international success in 1974, he abandoned his doctoral studies, but co-authored two peer reviewed research papers,[140][141] which were based on his observations at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife. In October 2006, May re-registered for his PhD at Imperial College and submitted his thesis in August 2007 (one year earlier than he estimated it would take to complete). As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by NASA's IRAS satellite. After a viva voce, the revised thesis (titled A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud)[1] was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced.[142][143][144][23][145] He was able to submit his thesis only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic during the intervening years and has described the subject as one that became \"trendy\" again in the 2000s. His PhD investigated radial velocity using absorption spectroscopy and doppler spectroscopy of zodiacal light using a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer based at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife. His research was initially supervised by Jim Ring,[2] Ken Reay[2] and in the latter stages by Michael Rowan-Robinson.[1] He graduated at the awards ceremony of Imperial College held in the Royal Albert Hall on 14 May 2008.[146] In October 2007, May was appointed a Visiting Researcher in Imperial College and continues his interest in astronomy and involvement with the Imperial Astrophysics Group. He is co-author, with Sir Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott, of Bang! \u2013 The Complete History of the Universe[147][148] and The Cosmic Tourist.[149] May appeared on the 700th episode of The Sky at Night hosted by Sir Patrick Moore, along with Chris Lintott, Jon Culshaw, Prof. Brian Cox, and the Astronomer Royal Martin Rees who on departing the panel, told Brian May, who was joining it, \"I don't know a scientist who looks as much like Isaac Newton as you do\".[150] May was also a guest on the first episode of the third series of the BBC's Stargazing Live, on 8 January 2013. On 17 November 2007, May was appointed Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University,[151] and installed in 2008 having also been awarded an honorary fellowship from the University for his contribution to astronomy and services to the public understanding of science.[152] He held the post until 2013.[150] Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him on 18 June 2008 on the suggestion of Patrick Moore (probably influenced by the asteroid's provisional designation of 1998 BM30).[119][153] In 2014, May co-founded Asteroid Day with Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweickart, B612 Foundation COO Danica Remy and German filmmaker Grigorij Richters. Asteroid Day is a global awareness campaign where people from around the world come together to learn about asteroids and what we can do to protect our planet.[154] May was a guest at the 2016 Starmus Festival where he also performed on stage with composer Hans Zimmer. The theme was Beyond The Horizon: A Tribute To Stephen Hawking.[155] During the New Horizons Pluto flyby NASA press conference held on 17 July 2015 at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, May was introduced as a science team collaborator. He told the panel \"You have inspired the world.\"[156][157] On 31 December 2018 through 1 January 2019, May was in attendance at the watch party for the New Horizons flyby of the Kuiper belt object, 486958 Arrokoth, and performed an updated version of his New Horizons celebratory song.[158] In 2019 he was awarded the Lawrence J. Burpee Medal of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for outstanding contributions to the advancement of geography.[159] From 1976 to 1988, May was married to Christine Mullen,[15] and they had three children: James (born 15 June 1978), Louisa (born 22 May 1981), and Emily Ruth (born 18 February 1987).[15] They separated in 1988. May had met actress Anita Dobson in 1986, and she inspired him to write the 1989 hit \"I Want It All\". They married on 18 November 2000.[160] He has stated in interviews that he suffered from severe depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to the point of contemplating suicide,[161] for reasons having to do with his troubled first marriage, his perceived failure as a husband and a father, his father Harold's death, and Freddie Mercury's illness and death.[162] According to The Sunday Times Rich List of 2019, May is worth \u00a3160 million ($207 million).[163] He has homes in London and Windlesham, Surrey.[164] May's father Harold was a long-time heavy cigarette smoker.[16] As a result, May dislikes smoking,[165] to the point where he was already prohibiting smoking indoors at his concerts before many countries imposed smoking bans.[166] He is an active animal rights advocate, and was appointed a vice-president of animal welfare charity, the RSPCA, in September 2012.[167] May describes himself as agnostic.[168] May is a long-term champion of woodland as a haven and \"corridor\" for wildlife, both in Surrey, where he has a house[169] and elsewhere. In 2012, he bought land threatened by building development at Bere Regis, Dorset and, in 2013 and with the enthusiastic support of local villagers,[170] initiated a project to create an area of woodland, now called May's Wood (or \"the Brian May Wood\").[171] The wood consists of 157 acres, formerly under the plough, planted by May's team of co-workers with 100,000 trees. May's Wood is said to be flourishing.[172][173] In 2013, a new species of the genus Heteragrion (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named Heteragrion brianmayi\u00a0\u2013 one of four Heteragrion flatwing damselflies named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.[174] May has formed a group to promote animal welfare. Though a Conservative Party voter most of his life,[175] he has stated that their policies on fox hunting and the culling of badgers meant he did not vote for them at the 2010 UK general election. His group, Save Me (named after the May-written Queen song), campaigns for the protection of all animals against unnecessary, cruel and degrading treatment; with a particular emphasis on preventing hunting of foxes and the culling of badgers.[13] The group's primary concern is to ensure that the Hunting Act 2004 and other laws protecting animals are retained in situ.[57] In an interview in September 2010 with Stephen Sackur for the BBC's HARDtalk program, May said that he would rather be remembered for his animal rights work than for his music or scientific work.[176] May is a staunch supporter of the RSPCA, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the League Against Cruel Sports, PETA UK and the Harper Asprey Wildlife Rescue. In March 2012, May contributed the foreword to a target paper published by the think tank the Bow Group, urging the government to reconsider its plans to cull thousands of badgers to control bovine TB, stating that the findings of Labour's major badger culling trials, several years earlier, show that culling does not work. The paper was authored by Graham Godwin-Pearson with contributions by leading tuberculosis scientists, including Lord Krebs.[177][178][179] In 2013, May joined French guitar player Jean-Pierre Danel for a charity Danel launched for the benefit of animal rights in France. The guitarists signed guitars and art photos together, and were joined by Hank Marvin.[180] In May 2013, May teamed up with actor Brian Blessed and Flash cartoonist Jonti \"Weebl\" Picking, as well as animal rights groups including the RSPCA, to form Team Badger, a \"coalition of organisations that have teamed up to fight the planned cull of badgers\".[181] With Weebl and Blessed, May recorded a single, \"Save the Badger Badger Badger\" \u2013 a mashup of Weebl's viral 2003 Flash cartoon meme, \"Badger Badger Badger\", and Queen's \"Flash\", featuring vocals by Blessed. On 1 September 2013, \"Save The Badger Badger Badger\" charted at No. 79 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 39 on the UK iTunes chart[182] and No. 1 on the iTunes Rock chart.[183] In June 2013 renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough and rock guitarist Slash joined May to form the supergroup, Artful Badger and Friends, and released a song dedicated to badgers, \"Badger Swagger\".[184] Prior to the 2015 general election, it was reported that May was considering standing as an independent Member of Parliament. It was also revealed that May had started a \"Common Decency\" project \"to re-establish common decency in our lives, work and Parliament\". May said he wanted to \"get rid of the current government\" and wished to see a House of Commons containing \"individuals voting according to their conscience\".[185] May was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas at the election.[186] He also endorsed a Conservative Party candidate, Henry Smith, on the grounds of his animal welfare record.[187] In July 2015, May criticised UK Prime Minister David Cameron for giving Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales. During a live television interview, he also attacked the pro-hunting organisation the Countryside Alliance as \"a bunch of lying bastards\" for their support for a change to the law.[188] The vote was postponed by the government following the intervention of the Scottish National Party's Westminster MPs, who committed to vote to keep the ban as it existed. May told anti-hunt protesters in a rally outside Parliament that it was \"a very, very important day for our democracy\" but added \"we have not yet won the war, there's no room for complacency\".[189] In June 2017, May endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 general election. May shared an article on Twitter by The Independent headlined \"Jeremy Corbyn says Fox hunting is 'barbarity' and pledges to keep it banned\"[190] and captioned it: \"Well, I guess that just about clinches it\u00a0!! Anyone see any good reason not to prefer the evidently decent Corbyn over the weak and wobbly Mrs May? Bri\".[191] In October 2018, May said, \"I don't like all this separatist stuff and you know this sort of illusion that we can all stand on our own, to me the future lies in co-operation. I get up every day and put my head in my hands about Brexit \u2013 I think it's the stupidest thing we ever tried to do.\" He also said that Prime Minister Theresa May was \"driven by vanity and thirst for power\".[192] In the run-up to the 2019 United Kingdom general election May criticised what he saw as the poor conduct of the media and stated he found it \"impossible\" to vote for either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson.[193] After the election in which Johnson won a majority, May vowed to continue fighting for animal rights but in an Instagram and blog post he urged his followers to \"wish Boris a decent chance to rebuild Britain\" and praised reforms to animal welfare laws made by Conservative Environment Secretary Michael Gove.[194][195] May has had a lifelong interest in collecting Victorian stereophotography. In 2009, with co-author Elena Vidal, he published his second book, A Village Lost and Found,[54] on the work of English stereophotography innovator T. R. Williams.[196] He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society's Saxby Medal in 2012 for achievement in the field of three-dimensional imaging.[197] May made a significant technical contribution to the book to accompany the exhibition 'Stereoscopic Photographs of Pablo Picasso by Robert Mouzillat', held at the Holburne Museum in Bath, England from February to June 2014. The book provides a cross-section of photographs of Picasso in his studio, at the bullfight at Arles, and in his garden. May's 3D 'Owl viewer' is used to view the photographs in 3D. The purchase of his first card in 1973 started May on a lifelong and worldwide search for Les Diableries,[198] which are stereoscopic photographs depicting scenes of daily life in Hell. On 10 October 2013[199] the book Diableries: Stereoscopic Adventures in Hell by Brian May, Denis Pellerin and Paula Fleming was published.[200] In 2017, May published Queen in 3-D, chronicling the group's 50-year history. It contains over 300 of his own stereoscopic photos and is the first book about the band published by one of its members. Included with the book is May's patented OWL Stereoscopic Viewer.[201] As part of May's role as a collaborator with the NASA's science team on the New Horizons mission, he worked on the first stereoanaglyph based on images of 486958 Arrokoth that were captured by the spacecraft.[202] In the 2018 biographical film Bohemian Rhapsody, he was portrayed by Gwilym Lee.[203] May himself served as a creative and musical consultant for the film.[204]",

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. His songs include \"We Will Rock You\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\", \"I Want It All\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"Flash\", \"Hammer to Fall\", \"Save Me\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" and \"The Show Must Go On\".\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, having previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album A Night at the Opera and its single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the Red Special.[3]\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the 1992 tribute concert, the release of Made in Heaven (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted the seventh greatest guitarist of all time.[4] He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".[5] In 2012, he was ranked the second greatest guitarist in a Guitar World magazine readers poll.[6] In 2001, May was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Queen and in 2018 the band received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[7]\nMay was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for \"services to the music industry and for charity work\".[8] May earned a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007,[1][2] and was Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 2008 to 2013.[9] He was a \"science team collaborator\" with NASA's New Horizons Pluto mission.[10][11] He is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign Asteroid Day.[12] Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him. May is also an animal rights activist, campaigning against the hunting of foxes and the culling of badgers in the UK.[13]\nBrian Harold May was born 19 July 1947[14] in Hampton, Middlesex,[15] the only child of Ruth Irving (Fletcher) and Harold May, who worked as a draughtsman at the Ministry of Aviation.[16][17] His mother was Scottish, while his father was English.[18] May attended the local Hampton Grammar School, then a voluntary aided school.[15][16][19] During this time, he formed his first band, named 1984 after George Orwell's novel of the same name, with vocalist and bassist Tim Staffell.[20]\nAt Hampton Grammar School, he attained ten GCE Ordinary Levels and three GCE Advanced Levels in Physics, Mathematics, and Applied Mathematics.[20] He studied Mathematics and Physics at Imperial College London, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 1968 with honours.[21][22] In 2007, May was awarded a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London for work started in 1971 and completed in 2007.[1][2][23]\nMay formed the band Smile in 1968. The group included Tim Staffell as the lead singer and bassist, and later, drummer Roger Taylor, who also went on to play for Queen. The band lasted for only two years, from 1968 to 1970, as Staffell departed in 1970, leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs. Smile would reunite for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band The Cross were headliners, and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".[24] May also performed several other songs that night.\nIn Queen's three-part vocal harmonies, May was generally the lower-range backing vocalist. On some of his songs, he sings the lead vocals, most notably the first verse of \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", the final verse of \"Mother Love\", the middle eight on \"I Want It All\" and \"Flash's Theme\", and full lead vocals on \"Some Day One Day\", \"She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilettoes)\", \"'39\", \"Good Company\", \"Long Away\", \"All Dead, All Dead\", \"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\", \"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\".[25]\nMay frequently wrote songs for the band and has composed many hits such as \"We Will Rock You\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\", \"I Want It All\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" and \"The Show Must Go On\" as well as \"Hammer to Fall\", \"Flash\", \"Now I'm Here\", \"Brighton Rock\", \"The Prophet's Song\", \"Las Palabras de Amor\", \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\" and \"Save Me\".[26]\nAfter the Live Aid concert in 1985, Mercury rang his band members and proposed writing a song together. The result was \"One Vision\", which was basically May on music (the Magic Years documentary shows how he came up with the opening section and the basic guitar riff) and the lyrics were co-written by all four band members.[27]\nFor their 1989 release album, The Miracle, the band had decided that all of the tracks would be credited to the entire band, no matter who had been the main writer.[28] Still, interviews and musical analyses tend to help identify the input of each member on each track. May composed \"I Want It All\" for that album, as well as \"Scandal\" (based on his personal problems with the British press). For the rest of the album he did not contribute so much creatively, although he helped in building the basis of \"Party\" and \"Was It All Worth It\" (both being predominantly Mercury's pieces) and created the guitar riff of \"Chinese Torture\".[28]\nQueen's subsequent album was Innuendo, on which May's contributions increased, although more in arrangements than actual writing in most cases; for the title track he did some of the arrangement for the heavy solo, then he added vocal harmonies to \"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" and composed the solo of \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\", a song for which the four of them decided the keyboard parts together.[29]\nTwo songs that May had composed for his first solo album, \"Headlong\" and \"I Can't Live With You\", eventually ended up in the Queen project. His other composition was \"The Show Must Go On\", a group effort in which he was the coordinator and primary composer.[30] In recent years, he has supervised the remastering of Queen albums and various DVD and greatest hits releases. In 2004, he announced that he and drummer Roger Taylor were going on tour for the first time in 18\u00a0years as \"Queen\", along with Free/Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers. Billed as \"Queen + Paul Rodgers\", the band played throughout 2005 and 2006 in South Africa, Europe, Aruba, Japan, and North America and released a new album with Paul Rodgers in 2008, entitled The Cosmos Rocks. This album was supported by a major tour.[31]\nPaul Rodgers then left the band[32] in May 2009 and it wasn't until 2011 that another vocalist, Adam Lambert,[33] was recruited. They subsequently went on a 2012 European Tour, a world tour over 2014 and 2015 and, most recently, 2016 Festival Tour. They also played the Big Ben New Year concert on New Year's Eve 2014 and New Year's Day 2015.[34]\nDuring 1983, several members of Queen explored side projects. On 21 and 22 April in Los Angeles, May was in the studio with Eddie Van Halen, with no intentions of recording anything; the result of those days was a mini album entitled Star Fleet Project, which originally wasn't going to be released. In 1986, May contributed to former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett's album Feedback 86, playing guitar on the track \"Cassandra\" and providing guitar and vocals for \"Slot Machine,\" the latter co-written by May. Although produced in 1986, the album was not issued as a commercial release until 2000. In the same year, May worked with actress Anita Dobson on her first album, most noted for the song \"Anyone Can Fall in Love\", which added lyrics to the EastEnders theme tune and reached no. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1986. May and Dobson would go on to marry in 2000.[35] In 1988, May contributed guitar solos to the song \"When Death Calls\" on Black Sabbath's 14th album Headless Cross, and the Living in a Box track \"Blow The House Down\" from the album Gatecrashing.[36] Both albums were released in 1989.\n\u00a0\u2014Joe Satriani[37]\nIn the aftermath of the November 1991 death of Mercury, May chose to deal with his grief by committing himself as fully as possible to work, first by finishing his solo album, Back to the Light,[38] and then touring worldwide to promote it. He frequently remarked in press interviews that this was the only form of self-prescribed therapy he could think of.[39] According to Def Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott, \"It was undoubtedly an enormous and terrible blow to lose someone he was so close to. Personally, I know it ripped the heart out of Brian, but having said that, he was in great spirits after the album was finished.\"[37] Back to the Light featured the single \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\", on which he collaborated as a songwriter with Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers. A version with Freddie Mercury's vocals was later released on the Queen album Made in Heaven and won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically &amp; Lyrically in 1996.[40]\nIn late 1992, the Brian May Band was officially formed. An earlier version of the band was loosely formed for 19 October 1991, the date of the band's last concert of reunion, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in Seville, Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, Cozy Powell on drums and percussion, Mike Moran and Rick Wakeman on keyboards, and Maggie Ryder, Miriam Stockley and Chris Thompson on backing vocals. The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, Michael Casswell on guitar, Neil Murray on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band lasted only during the South American support tour (supporting The B-52's and Joe Cocker) on only five dates.[41]\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist Jamie Moses on board to replace Mike Caswell. The other change made was in the backing vocals department, when Ryder, Stockley and Thompson were replaced with Catherine Porter and Shelley Preston. On 23 February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting Guns N' Roses and headlining a few dates.[42] The tour would take them through North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18 December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and John Deacon to work on tracks that became Made in Heaven, the final Queen studio album.[43] The band took Mercury's solo album demos and last recordings, which he managed to perform in the studio after the album Innuendo was finished, and completed them with their additions both musically and vocally.[44] Work on the album after Mercury's death originally began in 1992 by Deacon and May, but was left until a later date, due to other commitments.[43]\nIn 1995, May began working towards a new solo album of covers tentatively named Heroes, in addition to working on various film and television projects[45] and other collaborations. May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included Another World, and featured mainly Spike Edney, Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5 April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the M4 motorway near Bristol, England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band, with a new drummer being needed at short notice. Steve Ferrone was brought on to help May finish recording drums and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, Eric Singer replaced Steve Ferrone for the full 1998 world tour.\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a teddy boy crooner) would play a number of 1950s rock and roll standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled Retro Rock Special was attached to some pressings of the Another World album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.[46]\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on Chinese Democracy, however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.[47]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor. On 22 October 2000, he made a guest appearance at the Mot\u00f6rhead 25th Anniversary show at Brixton Academy along with Eddie Clarke (former Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist) for the encore song \"Overkill\". As part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II celebrations on 3 June 2002, May performed a guitar solo of \"God Save the Queen\" from the roof of Buckingham Palace, with the performance appearing on the 30th Anniversary DVD edition of A Night at the Opera.[48][49] In 2004, May played guitar on the song \"Someone to Die For\" on the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack.[50]\nIn the Queen's birthday honours list of 2005, he was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire \"for services to the music industry and for charity work\".[51] In the same year he played the guitar in the song Il mare... of the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari, in his album Zu &amp; Co., and he took part in the concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London held in May 2004, with the other guests of the Italian bluesman. May was a celebrity guest at the Genesis reunion concert at Twickenham Stadium in 2007.[52] May and Genesis frontman Phil Collins had worked together on two previous occasions, at The Prince's Trust Rock Gala in 1988 and the Party at the Palace in 2002, when Collins had played drums with Queen. In 2011 he contributed to a feature about Collins for FHM, praising him as \"a great guy and an amazing drummer\".[53]\nMay worked extensively with stage actress and singer Kerry Ellis after he cast her in the musical We Will Rock You. He produced and arranged her debut studio album Anthems (2010), a follow-up to her extended play Wicked in Rock (2008), as well as appearing with Ellis at many public performances\u00a0\u2013 playing guitar alongside her. He also contributed a guitar solo to Meat Loaf's Hang Cool, Teddy Bear album in exchange for the use of drummer John Miceli. Along with Elena Vidal, Brian May released a historical book in 2009 entitled A Village Lost and Found: Scenes in Our Village.[54] The book is an annotated collection of stereoscopic photographs taken by the Victorian era photographer T. R. Williams and it is sold with a focusing stereoscope. May became an enthusiast of stereoscope photographs as a child, and first encountered the work of Williams during the late 1960s. In 2003, May announced a search to identify the actual location of the Scenes in Our Village images. In 2004 May reported that he had identified the location as the village of Hinton Waldrist in Oxfordshire.[55]\nOn 20 May 2009, May and Queen bandmate Roger Taylor performed \"We Are the Champions\" live on the season finale of American Idol with winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert providing a vocal duet.[56] In November 2009, May appeared with Taylor on The X Factor, with Queen mentoring the contestants, then later performing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". In April 2010, May founded the \"Save Me\" 2010 project to work against any proposed repeal of the British fox-hunting ban, and also to promote animal rights in Britain.[57] In February 2011, it was announced that May would tour with Kerry Ellis, playing 12 dates across the UK in May 2011.[58]\nOn 18 April 2011, Lady Gaga confirmed that May would play guitar on her track \"You and I\" from her latest album Born This Way, released on 23 May 2011.[59] May joined Gaga on stage during the performance of \"You and I\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards held at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles.[60] In June 2011, May performed with Tangerine Dream at the Starmus Festival on Tenerife, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's first spaceflight.[61]\nOn 26 August, May performed \"We Will Rock You\" and \"Welcome to the Black Parade\" with rock band My Chemical Romance at the Reading Festival.[62] On 10 October, May made an appearance to celebrate the reunion of rock band The Darkness at an \"intimate\" 100 Club show with support from Dark Stares.[63][64] A long-time fan of the group, May performed three songs onstage with The Darkness, including Queen's \"Tie Your Mother Down\", at the Hammersmith Apollo on their subsequent \"comeback\" tour.[65][66]\nAt the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, Queen received the Global Icon Award, which Katy Perry presented to Brian May.[67] Queen closed the awards ceremony, with Adam Lambert on vocals, performing \"The Show Must Go On\", \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\".[67] The collaboration garnered a positive response from both fans and critics, resulting in speculation about future projects together.[68] Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012.[69][70] Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale.[71] A third London date was added for 14 July.[72] On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation.[73] Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic Stadium,[74][75] and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland.[76]\nIn January 2012, May featured on N-Dubz frontman Dappy's solo single \"Rockstar\",[77] providing \"rumbling guitar riffs which culminate in an electrifying solo\".[78] The pair also collaborated on a performance of \"We Will Rock You\" for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.[79]\nOn 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[80] May performed part of the \"Brighton Rock\" solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of \"We Will Rock You\".[80][81] On 16 September 2012, May appeared at the Sunflower Jam charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, performing alongside bassist John Paul Jones (of Led Zeppelin), drummer Ian Paice (of Deep Purple), and vocalists Bruce Dickinson (of Iron Maiden) and Alice Cooper.[82]\nMay donated his guitar talent to the end credits song from the film, A Dog Named Gucci, in the song \"One Voice\", which also features the talents of Norah Jones,  Aimee Mann, Susanna Hoffs, Lydia Loveless, Neko Case, and Kathryn Calder. It was produced by Dean Falcone, who also wrote the film's score. \"One Voice\" was released on Record Store Day, 16 April 2016, with profits from the sale of the single going to benefit animal charities.[83]\nAt the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \"featured with\" Queen as Queen + Paul Rodgers, not replacing the late Freddie Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.[84]\nBetween 2005 and 2006 Queen and Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg being Europe and the second, Japan and the US in 2006.[85] On 25 May 2006, Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, and May and Taylor were joined on stage with the Foo Fighters to perform a selection of Queen songs.[85][86] On 15 August 2006, May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \"secret location\".[87] The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe and parts of the US, opening on Kharkiv's freedom square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans.[88] The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD.[88] Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up on 12 May 2009. Rodgers does not rule out the possibility of working together again.[89][90]\nNot long after performing with American Idol finalists Kris Allen and Adam Lambert during the programme's season finale in 2009, May and Taylor began contemplating the future of Queen after the group's amicable split with frontman Paul Rodgers. Two years later, at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Queen was presented that year's Global Icon Award, accepted by May. As part of the broadcast, Queen performed a short set with Lambert, receiving an overwhelmingly welcoming response.[68] Speculation regarding a collaboration with Lambert soon arose, with the three formally announcing a short summer tour of Europe in 2012, including three dates at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, as well as shows in Ukraine, Russia and Poland. As with the partnership with Paul Rodgers, John Deacon did not participate.\nThe collaboration was revived in 2013, when the three performed together at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas on 20 September.[91] Five months later, May, Taylor and Lambert announced a 19-date summer tour of North America on Good Morning America.[92] Due to ticket demand, five dates were soon added.[93] In May 2014, shows in Australia[94] and New Zealand[95] were announced, along with festival performances in South Korea[96] and Japan.[97] The tour was extended to the UK and greater Europe in early 2015.[98] The group performed together in South America in September 2015, including Queen's first performance at the Rock in Rio Festival since 1985.[99]\nIn 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day.[100] On 12 September they performed at the Park Hayarkon in Tel-Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people.[101] In September 2018 the group had a residency in the MGM Park Theater in Las Vegas.[102] Though the collaboration remains active, there are currently no plans of recording a studio album, though the three are willing to do so in the future.[103]\nOn 29 March 2019, May inducted Def Leppard into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[104] In April 2019, he worked with contemporary metal band Five Finger Death Punch and country artist Kenny Wayne Shepherd to re-record a new version of \"Blue on Black\" in support of The Gary Sinise Foundation. The artists came together to merge country and mainstream rock to re-create the classic song originally co-written by Shepherd.[105] At the end of the month he also performed songs including \"All the Young Dudes\" with Def Leppard's Joe Elliott at a Mott the Hoople show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire.[106]\n\u00a0\u2014Steve Vai[107]\n\u00a0\u2014Andy Powell, Wishbone Ash[37]\nMay has been referred to as a virtuoso guitarist by many publications and musicians.[108][109][110][111][112] He has featured in various music polls of great rock guitarists, and in 2011 was ranked number 26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".[5] In January 2007, the readers of Guitar World voted May's guitar solos on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Brighton Rock\" into the \"top 50 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time\" (No.20 and No.41 respectively).[113] Former Van Halen vocalist Sammy Hagar stated, \"I thought Queen were really innovative and made some great sounding records.. I like the rockin' stuff. I think Brian May has one of the great guitar tones on the planet, and I really, really love his guitar work.\"[112] Justin Hawkins, lead guitarist of The Darkness, cites May as his earliest influence, saying \"I really loved his tone and vibrato and everything. I thought his playing sounded like a singing voice. I wanted to be able to do that. Whenever I went to guitar lessons, I was always asking to learn Queen stuff.\"[114]\n\nAmerican guitar virtuoso Steve Vai has spoken highly of May's work, saying:In that whole genre, in that whole period\u2014he's one of the most unique contributors. He doesn't get credit. Because what he does is so rich and so specific, and so deep, it fits so well in Queen music, you just feel it as part of that music. But when you break it down and when you look at it from a guitar player's point of view, it's unique, and nobody to this date could do what he does and make it sound like that. He is an iconic player. His tone, his choice of melody notes, he doesn't just do solos. His solos are melodies, and they're perfectly in place.[115]Most of May's electric guitar work live and in the studio is done on the Red Special, which he built with his father, an electronics engineer, when he was sixteen years old.[16][116][117][118][3][119] It was built with wood from an 18th-century fireplace, and was composed of household items such as mother-of-pearl buttons, shelf edging, and motorbike valve springs. While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.[120] These plans were eventually given to guitar luthier Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".[120]\nMay commented on the Red Special:\nI like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide. I lacquered the fingerboard with Rustin's Plastic Coating. The tremolo is interesting in that the arm's made from an old bicycle saddle bag carrier, the knob at the end's off a knitting needle and the springs are valve springs from an old motorbike.[121]\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially a sixpence from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic plectrum, on the basis that their rigidity gives him more control in playing.[122] He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.[122]\nA meticulous arranger, he focuses on multi-part harmonies, often more contrapuntal than parallel \u2013 a relative rarity for rock guitar. Examples are found in Queen's albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races, where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"Teo Torriatte\").\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including sweep picking (\"Was It All Worth It\", \"Chinese Torture\"), tremolo (\"Brighton Rock\", \"Stone Cold Crazy\", \"Death on Two Legs\", \"Sweet Lady\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Get Down Make Love\", \"Dragon Attack\"), tapping (\"Bijou\", \"It's Late\", \"Resurrection\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"), slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"), Hendrix sounding licks (\"Liar\", \"Brighton Rock\"), tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\") and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Killer Queen\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by Freddie Mercury, who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from Queen II),  \"Love of My Life\" and the skiffle-influenced \"'39\" (both from A Night at the Opera).\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"Procession\"; in \"Get Down, Make Love\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.[123] May also used his guitar to create the chime effect in \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".[124]\nMay's early influences included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, who he says were \"the most metallic thing(s) out at the time.\" Many years later he gained his opportunity to play on separate occasions with both Cliff Richard and Shadows lead guitarist Hank Marvin. He has collaborated with Cliff Richard on a re-recording of the Cliff Richard and the Shadows (then known as the Drifters) 1958 hit \"Move It\" on the Cliff Richard duets album Two's Company which was released on 6 November 2006.[125]\nMay always stated that the Beatles, Led Zeppelin,[126] the Who and Jimi Hendrix were the greatest influences on him. On the Queen for an Hour interview on BBC Radio\u00a01 in 1989, May listed Hendrix, Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton as his guitar heroes. In a 1991 interview for Guitar World magazine, May referred to the Who as \"my inspiration\", and on seeing Led Zeppelin stated, \"We used to look at those guys and think, 'That's the way it should be done.'\"[127] May told Guitarist in 2004: \"I don't think anyone has epitomised riff writing better than Jimmy Page \u2013 he's one of the great brains of rock music\".[128]\nMay also cites Rory Gallagher as a major influence, saying \"He was a magician. He was one of the very few people of that time who could make his guitar do anything, it seemed. I remember looking at that battered Stratocaster and thinking, 'How does that (sound) come out of there?'\" According to May, \"...it was Rory that gave me my sound, and that's the sound I still have.\"[129] May was also influenced by Steve Hackett, guitarist of progressive rock band Genesis,[130] in particular his harmony guitar solo at the end of the band's epic 1971 song \"The Musical Box\".[131] Hackett said of May, \"Equally, his energetic approach to guitar inspired me.\"[132]\nFrom 1975 onwards, May had some replicas made of the Red Special, some of which were also used for live and recording purposes, others being mainly spares. The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May actually smashed it during a concert in the States in 1982), Greco BM90 (featured in the promo video of \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997\u20131998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton[133] (back-up from 2003 to present). On stage, May used to carry at least one back-up guitar (in case he broke a string) and occasionally would use others for certain songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company which makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.\nHe currently has a Guild 12-string to replace his Ovation Pacemaker. Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation, Martin, T\u014dkai Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a Washburn RR2V on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\nIn 1984, Guild released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300\u00a0guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000\u00a0copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\u00a0\u2014Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery on sharing a stage with May in the 1980s.[135]\nMay has used Vox AC30 amplifiers almost exclusively since a meeting with his long-time hero Rory Gallagher at a gig in London during the late 1960s/early 1970s.[136] In the mid-1970s he used six of them, with an Echoplex delay (with extended delay time) plugged into a separate amplifier, and a second Echoplex plugged into yet another amp; he used a homemade booster, his only effects pedal, which was on all the time.[137] His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.[138]\nMay also customises his amps by removing the circuitry for the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal), and this alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137\u00a0dB. He always used a treble booster which, along with the AC30 and his custom 'Deacy Amp' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.[139] He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to A Day at the Races. Effects designer Pete Cornish built for him the TB-83 (32\u00a0dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14\u00a0AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay\u00a01, Delay\u00a02. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a BOSS pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"In The Lap of The Gods\" (Live at Wembley '86) or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.\u00a0Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"Save Me\" and \"Flash\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"Let Me Live\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used Yamaha DX7 synths for the opening sequence of \"One Vision\" and the backgrounds of \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" (also on stage), \"Scandal\" and \"The Show Must Go On\".\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the banjolele. He used a \"genuine George Formby Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"Bring Back That Leroy Brown\" and \"Good Company\". Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a Yamaha plastic piano in \"Teo Torriatte\" and a toy mini koto in \"The Prophet's Song\".\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's Queen II to The Game, May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with Lee Holdridge, Il Colosso, for Steve Barron's 1996 film, The Adventures of Pinocchio.  May performed the opera with Jerry Hadley, Sissel Kyrkjebo, and Just William.  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\nMay studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and ARCS in physics with Upper Second-Class Honours. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a PhD[1] degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from interplanetary dust and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System. When Queen started to have international success in 1974, he abandoned his doctoral studies, but co-authored two peer reviewed research papers,[140][141] which were based on his observations at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife.\nIn October 2006, May re-registered for his PhD at Imperial College and submitted his thesis in August 2007 (one year earlier than he estimated it would take to complete). As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by NASA's IRAS satellite. After a viva voce, the revised thesis (titled A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud)[1] was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced.[142][143][144][23][145] He was able to submit his thesis only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic during the intervening years and has described the subject as one that became \"trendy\" again in the 2000s. His PhD investigated radial velocity using absorption spectroscopy and doppler spectroscopy of zodiacal light using a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer based at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife. His research was initially supervised by Jim Ring,[2] Ken Reay[2] and in the latter stages by Michael Rowan-Robinson.[1] He graduated at the awards ceremony of Imperial College held in the Royal Albert Hall on 14 May 2008.[146]\nIn October 2007, May was appointed a Visiting Researcher in Imperial College and continues his interest in astronomy and involvement with the Imperial Astrophysics Group. He is co-author, with Sir Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott, of Bang! \u2013 The Complete History of the Universe[147][148] and The Cosmic Tourist.[149] May appeared on the 700th episode of The Sky at Night hosted by Sir Patrick Moore, along with Chris Lintott, Jon Culshaw, Prof. Brian Cox, and the Astronomer Royal Martin Rees who on departing the panel, told Brian May, who was joining it, \"I don't know a scientist who looks as much like Isaac Newton as you do\".[150] May was also a guest on the first episode of the third series of the BBC's Stargazing Live, on 8 January 2013.\nOn 17 November 2007, May was appointed Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University,[151] and installed in 2008 having also been awarded an honorary fellowship from the University for his contribution to astronomy and services to the public understanding of science.[152] He held the post until 2013.[150] Asteroid 52665 Brianmay was named after him on 18 June 2008 on the suggestion of Patrick Moore (probably influenced by the asteroid's provisional designation of 1998 BM30).[119][153]\nIn 2014, May co-founded Asteroid Day with Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweickart, B612 Foundation COO Danica Remy and German filmmaker Grigorij Richters. Asteroid Day is a global awareness campaign where people from around the world come together to learn about asteroids and what we can do to protect our planet.[154] May was a guest at the 2016 Starmus Festival where he also performed on stage with composer Hans Zimmer. The theme was Beyond The Horizon: A Tribute To Stephen Hawking.[155]\nDuring the New Horizons Pluto flyby NASA press conference held on 17 July 2015 at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, May was introduced as a science team collaborator. He told the panel \"You have inspired the world.\"[156][157] On 31 December 2018 through 1 January 2019, May was in attendance at the watch party for the New Horizons flyby of the Kuiper belt object, 486958 Arrokoth, and performed an updated version of his New Horizons celebratory song.[158]\nIn 2019 he was awarded the Lawrence J. Burpee Medal of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for outstanding contributions to the advancement of geography.[159]\nFrom 1976 to 1988, May was married to Christine Mullen,[15] and they had three children: James (born 15 June 1978), Louisa (born 22 May 1981), and Emily Ruth (born 18 February 1987).[15] They separated in 1988. May had met actress Anita Dobson in 1986, and she inspired him to write the 1989 hit \"I Want It All\". They married on 18 November 2000.[160]\nHe has stated in interviews that he suffered from severe depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to the point of contemplating suicide,[161] for reasons having to do with his troubled first marriage, his perceived failure as a husband and a father, his father Harold's death, and Freddie Mercury's illness and death.[162]\nAccording to The Sunday Times Rich List of 2019, May is worth \u00a3160 million ($207 million).[163] He has homes in London and Windlesham, Surrey.[164] May's father Harold was a long-time heavy cigarette smoker.[16] As a result, May dislikes smoking,[165] to the point where he was already prohibiting smoking indoors at his concerts before many countries imposed smoking bans.[166] He is an active animal rights advocate, and was appointed a vice-president of animal welfare charity, the RSPCA, in September 2012.[167] May describes himself as agnostic.[168]\nMay is a long-term champion of woodland as a haven and \"corridor\" for wildlife, both in Surrey, where he has a house[169] and elsewhere. In 2012, he bought land threatened by building development at Bere Regis, Dorset and, in 2013 and with the enthusiastic support of local villagers,[170] initiated a project to create an area of woodland, now called May's Wood (or \"the Brian May Wood\").[171] The wood consists of 157 acres, formerly under the plough, planted by May's team of co-workers with 100,000 trees. May's Wood is said to be flourishing.[172][173]\nIn 2013, a new species of the genus Heteragrion (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named Heteragrion brianmayi\u00a0\u2013 one of four Heteragrion flatwing damselflies named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.[174]\nMay has formed a group to promote animal welfare. Though a Conservative Party voter most of his life,[175] he has stated that their policies on fox hunting and the culling of badgers meant he did not vote for them at the 2010 UK general election. His group, Save Me (named after the May-written Queen song), campaigns for the protection of all animals against unnecessary, cruel and degrading treatment; with a particular emphasis on preventing hunting of foxes and the culling of badgers.[13] The group's primary concern is to ensure that the Hunting Act 2004 and other laws protecting animals are retained in situ.[57]\nIn an interview in September 2010 with Stephen Sackur for the BBC's HARDtalk program, May said that he would rather be remembered for his animal rights work than for his music or scientific work.[176] May is a staunch supporter of the RSPCA, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the League Against Cruel Sports, PETA UK and the Harper Asprey Wildlife Rescue. In March 2012, May contributed the foreword to a target paper published by the think tank the Bow Group, urging the government to reconsider its plans to cull thousands of badgers to control bovine TB, stating that the findings of Labour's major badger culling trials, several years earlier, show that culling does not work. The paper was authored by Graham Godwin-Pearson with contributions by leading tuberculosis scientists, including Lord Krebs.[177][178][179]\nIn 2013, May joined French guitar player Jean-Pierre Danel for a charity Danel launched for the benefit of animal rights in France. The guitarists signed guitars and art photos together, and were joined by Hank Marvin.[180]\nIn May 2013, May teamed up with actor Brian Blessed and Flash cartoonist Jonti \"Weebl\" Picking, as well as animal rights groups including the RSPCA, to form Team Badger, a \"coalition of organisations that have teamed up to fight the planned cull of badgers\".[181] With Weebl and Blessed, May recorded a single, \"Save the Badger Badger Badger\" \u2013 a mashup of Weebl's viral 2003 Flash cartoon meme, \"Badger Badger Badger\", and Queen's \"Flash\", featuring vocals by Blessed. On 1 September 2013, \"Save The Badger Badger Badger\" charted at No. 79 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 39 on the UK iTunes chart[182] and No. 1 on the iTunes Rock chart.[183] In June 2013 renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough and rock guitarist Slash joined May to form the supergroup, Artful Badger and Friends, and released a song dedicated to badgers, \"Badger Swagger\".[184]\nPrior to the 2015 general election, it was reported that May was considering standing as an independent Member of Parliament. It was also revealed that May had started a \"Common Decency\" project \"to re-establish common decency in our lives, work and Parliament\". May said he wanted to \"get rid of the current government\" and wished to see a House of Commons containing \"individuals voting according to their conscience\".[185] May was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas at the election.[186] He also endorsed a Conservative Party candidate, Henry Smith, on the grounds of his animal welfare record.[187]\nIn July 2015, May criticised UK Prime Minister David Cameron for giving Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales. During a live television interview, he also attacked the pro-hunting organisation the Countryside Alliance as \"a bunch of lying bastards\" for their support for a change to the law.[188] The vote was postponed by the government following the intervention of the Scottish National Party's Westminster MPs, who committed to vote to keep the ban as it existed. May told anti-hunt protesters in a rally outside Parliament that it was \"a very, very important day for our democracy\" but added \"we have not yet won the war, there's no room for complacency\".[189]\nIn June 2017, May endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 general election. May shared an article on Twitter by The Independent headlined \"Jeremy Corbyn says Fox hunting is 'barbarity' and pledges to keep it banned\"[190] and captioned it: \"Well, I guess that just about clinches it\u00a0!! Anyone see any good reason not to prefer the evidently decent Corbyn over the weak and wobbly Mrs May? Bri\".[191]\nIn October 2018, May said, \"I don't like all this separatist stuff and you know this sort of illusion that we can all stand on our own, to me the future lies in co-operation. I get up every day and put my head in my hands about Brexit \u2013 I think it's the stupidest thing we ever tried to do.\" He also said that Prime Minister Theresa May was \"driven by vanity and thirst for power\".[192]\nIn the run-up to the 2019 United Kingdom general election May criticised what he saw as the poor conduct of the media and stated he found it \"impossible\" to vote for either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson.[193] After the election in which Johnson won a majority, May vowed to continue fighting for animal rights but in an Instagram and blog post he urged his followers to \"wish Boris a decent chance to rebuild Britain\" and praised reforms to animal welfare laws made by Conservative Environment Secretary Michael Gove.[194][195]\nMay has had a lifelong interest in collecting Victorian stereophotography. In 2009, with co-author Elena Vidal, he published his second book, A Village Lost and Found,[54] on the work of English stereophotography innovator T. R. Williams.[196] He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society's Saxby Medal in 2012 for achievement in the field of three-dimensional imaging.[197]\nMay made a significant technical contribution to the book to accompany the exhibition 'Stereoscopic Photographs of Pablo Picasso by Robert Mouzillat', held at the Holburne Museum in Bath, England from February to June 2014. The book provides a cross-section of photographs of Picasso in his studio, at the bullfight at Arles, and in his garden. May's 3D 'Owl viewer' is used to view the photographs in 3D.\nThe purchase of his first card in 1973 started May on a lifelong and worldwide search for Les Diableries,[198] which are stereoscopic photographs depicting scenes of daily life in Hell. On 10 October 2013[199] the book Diableries: Stereoscopic Adventures in Hell by Brian May, Denis Pellerin and Paula Fleming was published.[200]\nIn 2017, May published Queen in 3-D, chronicling the group's 50-year history. It contains over 300 of his own stereoscopic photos and is the first book about the band published by one of its members. Included with the book is May's patented OWL Stereoscopic Viewer.[201] As part of May's role as a collaborator with the NASA's science team on the New Horizons mission, he worked on the first stereoanaglyph based on images of 486958 Arrokoth that were captured by the spacecraft.[202]\nIn the 2018 biographical film Bohemian Rhapsody, he was portrayed by Gwilym Lee.[203] May himself served as a creative and musical consultant for the film.[204]\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nAnderson Hays Cooper (born June 3, 1967)[1] is an American journalist, television personality, and author. He is the primary anchor of the CNN news show Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0. The program is usually broadcast live from a New York City studio; however, Cooper often broadcasts live from CNN's studios in Washington, D.C., or on location for breaking news stories. In addition, he is a correspondent for 60 Minutes. From September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as host of his own eponymous syndicated daytime talk show, Anderson Live.[2] Cooper was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger son of the writer Wyatt Emory Cooper and the artist, fashion designer, writer, and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and his maternal great-great-great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune.[3] He is also a descendant, through his mother, of Civil War brevet Major General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, who was with General William T. Sherman on his march through Georgia. Through his \"Vanderbilt\" line, he is a second cousin, once removed, of screenwriter James Vanderbilt. Cooper's media experience began early. As a baby, he was photographed by Diane Arbus for Harper's Bazaar.[4][5] At the age of three, Cooper was a guest on The Tonight Show on September 17, 1970, appearing with his mother.[citation needed] At the age of nine, he appeared on To Tell the Truth as an impostor. From age 10 to 13, Cooper modeled with Ford Models for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Macy's.[6] Cooper's father suffered a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery, and died January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. Cooper considers his father's book Families to be \"sort of a guide on...how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.\"[6] Cooper's older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, committed suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's death in the book A Mother's Story, in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug salbutamol. Anderson cites Carter's suicide for sparking his interest in journalism. \"Loss is a theme that I think a lot about, and it's something in my work that I dwell on. I think when you experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, you have questions about survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can't tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own?\"[6] Cooper was educated at the Dalton School, a private co-educational university preparatory day school in New York City. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a \"survival trip\". He contracted malaria on the trip and was hospitalized in Kenya. Describing the experience, Cooper wrote \"Africa was a place to forget and be forgotten in.\"[6][7][8] Cooper attended Yale University, where he resided in Trumbull College. He was inducted into the Manuscript Society, majoring in political science and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989.[9] During college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science. He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education[10][11] and is a self-proclaimed \"news junkie since [he] was in utero.\"[12] After his first correspondence work in the early 1990s, he took a break from reporting and lived in Vietnam for a year, during which time he studied the Vietnamese language at Vietnam National University, Hanoi.[13] After Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States.[14] Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government.[12] He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One. After reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi-8 camera with him, Cooper soon began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. He later returned to filming stories from a variety of war-torn regions around the globe, including Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda. On assignment for several years[when?], Cooper had very slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: \"I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad.\"[7] One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it: On the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, \"You need to take a look at what you were doing.\" \"And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective.\"[7] In 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000, he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole. My last year at ABC, I was working overnights anchoring this newscast, then during the day at 20/20. So I was sleeping in two- or four-hour shifts, and I was really tired and wanted a change. I wanted to clear my head and get out of news a little bit, and I was interested in reality TV\u2014and it was interesting.[12] Cooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin for the TV talk show Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery.[15] As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go into work. Cooper left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, \"Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.\"[12] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square. On September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said: I think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it. I think you have to be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, and talk about what you do know, and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it. I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem.[12] In 2005, Cooper covered a number of important stories, including the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi. In 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, \u201cYeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.\u201d[6] A contributor to Broadcasting & Cable magazine wrote: \"In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm.\"[16] In September 2005, the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper \"the anchorperson of the future.\"[17] Following the addition of Cooper, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that \"[Cooper's] name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue.\"[18] To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper's 360\u00b0 program would be expanded to 2 hours and shifted into the 10\u00a0pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Cooper's former 7\u00a0pm ET slot. With \"no options\" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having \"mutually agreed\" with Jonathan Klein on the matter.[19] In early 2007, Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million.[20] In 2007, he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show which honors and recognizes extraordinary deeds by ordinary people. In October 2007, Cooper began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril, with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008.[21][22] In September 2010, Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Anderson (now titled Anderson Live).[23] The show premiered on September 12, 2011,[24] and, as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0.[25][26] On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Anderson Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Anderson Live aired on May 30, 2013. Along with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.[27] This made him the first openly gay person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election.[28] In 2017, Andy Cohen joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.[29][30] They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018.[31] Cooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent. Andy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015.[32][33] The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta.[33] The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.[34][35] Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching over 50 cities as of October 2018.[36] Cooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe.[37] A freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including Details magazine.[38] In May 2006, Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, Dispatches from the Edge, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book's proceeds are donated to charity.[39] The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list on June 18, 2006.[40] In 2017, Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss. Complied from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt's tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave \"nothing left unsaid\" between the pair. [41] It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication. [42] Cooper has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus \"Stan\" Stokowski (b. 1950), and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria Vanderbilt's ten-year marriage to the conductor Leopold Stokowski.[43] While promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey that he had dyslexia as a child.[44] In August 2007, he confirmed his \"mild dyslexia\" on The Tonight Show to Jay Leno, who also has dyslexia. Cooper is openly gay; according to The New York Times, he is \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television.\"[45] For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews. On July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part: I've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something\u2014something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. This is distressing because it is simply not true. ... The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud.[46] In 2014, Cooper and his partner purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut.[47] Apple CEO Tim Cook turned to Cooper for advice before he subsequently made the decision to publicly come out as gay.[48] Also in 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates' Finding Your Roots, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the Southern United States.[49][50] In March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and his long-time boyfriend Benjamin Maisani had split up.[51]",

He is the primary anchor of the CNN news show Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0. The program is usually broadcast live from a New York City studio; however, Cooper often broadcasts live from CNN's studios in Washington, D.C., or on location for breaking news stories.  In addition, he is a correspondent for 60 Minutes.\nFrom September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as host of his own eponymous syndicated daytime talk show, Anderson Live.[2]\nCooper was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger son of the writer Wyatt Emory Cooper and the artist, fashion designer, writer, and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and his maternal great-great-great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune.[3] He is also a descendant, through his mother, of Civil War brevet Major General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, who was with General William T. Sherman on his march through Georgia. Through his \"Vanderbilt\" line, he is a second cousin, once removed, of screenwriter James Vanderbilt.\nCooper's media experience began early. As a baby, he was photographed by Diane Arbus for Harper's Bazaar.[4][5]  At the age of three, Cooper was a guest on The Tonight Show on September 17, 1970, appearing with his mother.[citation needed] At the age of nine, he appeared on To Tell the Truth as an impostor.  From age 10 to 13, Cooper modeled with Ford Models for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Macy's.[6]\nCooper's father suffered a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery, and died January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. Cooper considers his father's book Families to be \"sort of a guide on...how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.\"[6]\nCooper's older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, committed suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's death in the book A Mother's Story, in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug salbutamol. Anderson cites Carter's suicide for sparking his interest in journalism.\n\"Loss is a theme that I think a lot about, and it's something in my work that I dwell on. I think when you experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, you have questions about survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can't tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own?\"[6]\nCooper was educated at the Dalton School, a private co-educational university preparatory day school in New York City. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a \"survival trip\". He contracted malaria on the trip and was hospitalized in Kenya. Describing the experience, Cooper wrote \"Africa was a place to forget and be forgotten in.\"[6][7][8] Cooper attended Yale University, where he resided in Trumbull College. He was inducted into the Manuscript Society, majoring in political science and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989.[9]\nDuring college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science. He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education[10][11] and is a self-proclaimed \"news junkie since [he] was in utero.\"[12] After his first correspondence work in the early 1990s, he took a break from reporting and lived in Vietnam for a year, during which time he studied the Vietnamese language at Vietnam National University, Hanoi.[13]\nAfter Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States.[14] Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government.[12] He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One.\nAfter reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi-8 camera with him, Cooper soon began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. He later returned to filming stories from a variety of war-torn regions around the globe, including Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda.\nOn assignment for several years[when?], Cooper had very slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: \"I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad.\"[7] One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:\nOn the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, \"You need to take a look at what you were doing.\" \"And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective.\"[7]\nIn 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000, he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole.\nMy last year at ABC, I was working overnights anchoring this newscast, then during the day at 20/20. So I was sleeping in two- or four-hour shifts, and I was really tired and wanted a change. I wanted to clear my head and get out of news a little bit, and I was interested in reality TV\u2014and it was interesting.[12]\nCooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin for the TV talk show Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery.[15] As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go into work.\nCooper left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, \"Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.\"[12] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square.\nOn September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 on CNN.  Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said:\nI think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it. I think you have to be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, and talk about what you do know, and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it. I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem.[12]\nIn 2005, Cooper covered a number of important stories, including the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi.\nIn 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, \u201cYeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.\u201d[6] A contributor to Broadcasting &amp; Cable magazine wrote: \"In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm.\"[16]\nIn September 2005, the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper \"the anchorperson of the future.\"[17]\nFollowing the addition of Cooper, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that \"[Cooper's] name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue.\"[18] To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper's 360\u00b0 program would be expanded to 2 hours and shifted into the 10\u00a0pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Cooper's former 7\u00a0pm ET slot. With \"no options\" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having \"mutually agreed\" with Jonathan Klein on the matter.[19]\nIn early 2007, Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million.[20]\nIn 2007, he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show which honors and recognizes extraordinary deeds by ordinary people.\nIn October 2007, Cooper began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril, with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008.[21][22]\nIn September 2010, Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Anderson (now titled Anderson Live).[23] The show premiered on September 12, 2011,[24] and, as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0.[25][26] On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Anderson Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Anderson Live aired on May 30, 2013.\nAlong with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.[27] This made him the first openly gay person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election.[28]\nIn 2017, Andy Cohen joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.[29][30] They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018.[31]\nCooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent.\nAndy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their  conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015.[32][33] The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta.[33] The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.[34][35] Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching over 50 cities as of October 2018.[36]\nCooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe.[37]\nA freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including Details magazine.[38]\nIn May 2006, Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, Dispatches from the Edge, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book's proceeds are donated to charity.[39] The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list on June 18, 2006.[40]\nIn 2017, Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss. Complied from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt's tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave \"nothing left unsaid\" between the pair. [41] It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication. [42]\nCooper has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus \"Stan\" Stokowski (b. 1950), and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria Vanderbilt's ten-year marriage to the conductor Leopold Stokowski.[43]\nWhile promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey that he had dyslexia as a child.[44] In August 2007, he confirmed his \"mild dyslexia\" on The Tonight Show to Jay Leno, who also has dyslexia.\nCooper is openly gay; according to The New York Times, he is \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television.\"[45] For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews.\nOn July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part:\nI've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something\u2014something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. This is distressing because it is simply not true. ... The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud.[46]\nIn 2014, Cooper and his partner purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut.[47] Apple CEO Tim Cook turned to Cooper for advice before he subsequently made the decision to publicly come out as gay.[48]\nAlso in 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates' Finding Your Roots, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the Southern United States.[49][50]\nIn March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and his long-time boyfriend Benjamin Maisani had split up.[51]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nBritish racing driver Rivalries Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver who races in Formula One for Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport. A six-time Formula One World Champion, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of the sport, and considered by some to be the greatest of all time.[note 2] He won his first World Drivers' Championship with McLaren in 2008, before moving to Mercedes in 2013, with whom he has won a further five titles. One of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport, Hamilton's six World Championship titles is the second-most of all time, as is his tally of 84 race victories and 151 podium finishes. He currently holds the records for the all-time most career points (3431), the all-time most pole positions (88), the most grand slams in a season (3) and the most points in a season (413).[note 3] Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton enjoyed a successful ascent up the racing ladder and was signed to the McLaren young driver programme in 1998. This later resulted in a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007, making Hamilton the first and only black driver to race in the sport.[note 4] That season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\u2014making a crucial overtake on the last corner of the last lap in the last race of the season\u2014to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history. After four more years with McLaren without finishing higher than fourth in the drivers' standings, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013, reuniting with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. Changes to regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines contributed to the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he has won five further World Championship titles. Hamilton won consecutive titles in 2014 and 2015 during an intense and sometimes volatile rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg, to match his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships. Following Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two intense championship battles, and Hamilton twice overturned mid-season points deficits to claim consecutive titles for the second time in his career in 2017 and 2018. A third World Drivers' Championship followed in 2019 to complete a hat-trick of consecutive titles, bringing his tally to six overall, second only to seven-time World Drivers' Champion Michael Schumacher. Hamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle and other ventures, including his environmental activism and exploits in music and fashion. Hamilton has been targeted by racist abuse throughout his career, and has been outspoken in his criticism of racial politics in Formula One as well as calling for greater diversity in the sport. His treatment by British newspapers has also been criticised for carrying racial bias, and some have pointed to Hamilton's race and physical appearance as reasons behind his perceived unpopularity among a portion of motorsport fans. Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England.[2] Hamilton's mother, Carmen (Larbalestier), is white British, while his father, Anthony Hamilton, is black British, making him mixed-race;[8] he self-identifies as black.[9] Lewis's parents separated when he was two and, as a result of this, he lived with his mother and half-sisters until he was twelve.[10] He then moved to live with his father, stepmother Linda and half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver and has cerebral palsy.[11] Hamilton was raised a Roman Catholic.[12] At the age of five Hamilton took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school;[13] later, he learned to ride a unicycle, as part of his karting rivalry with future Formula One Mercedes teammate, Nico Rosberg, who could already ride one.[14] Hamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car in 1991, which gave him his first taste of racing competition before finishing second in the national BRCA championship the following year. He said of the time: \"I was racing these remote-controlled cars and winning club championships against adults\".[15] His father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when Hamilton was six[16] and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school. To support his son, Anthony took redundancy from his position as an information technology manager and became a contractor; sometimes working up to three jobs at a time, while still attending all his son's races. Anthony later set up his own computer company, still managing Lewis;[17] Hamilton would later end his working relationship with his father in early 2010.[18] Lewis Hamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.[19] In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young.[17] Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams.[20] In February 2001 he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.[21] Hamilton began karting in 1993, when he was eight,[22] at the Rye House Kart Circuit[23] and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships. Two years later, he approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis for an autograph, and told him, \"Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.\" Dennis wrote in his autograph book, \"Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then.\" Hamilton drove for Martin Hines's Zip Young Guns Karting Team.[24] By the age of 12, his driving skill was high enough that Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One Grand Prix before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25.[25] He progressed through to Junior Yamaha in 1997, and in 1998, Dennis called Hamilton after he won an additional Super One series and his second British championship.[15] Dennis delivered on his promise and signed Hamilton to the McLaren driver development programme.[8] The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract which later resulted in a Formula One drive.[22] \u2014Michael Schumacher, speaking about Hamilton in 2001.[26] Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers' Club made him a \"Rising Star\" Member in 2000.[27] In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton (see quote box).[28] Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series. Despite crashing on his third lap in the car in testing, he finished fifth overall in the winter series.[15] This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished third overall with three wins and three pole positions.[29] He remained with Manor for another year and won the championship with ten wins and 419 points to the two wins and 377 points of his nearest rival, Alex Lloyd.[30] Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship.[31] In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,[32] and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.[33] Asked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was \"not to be the youngest in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One\".[34] Later in 2004, Williams would announce that they had come close to signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[35] He eventually re-signed with McLaren, and made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series. They won one race and Hamilton ended the year fifth in the championship.[36] He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix[37] and raced one of the Macau F3 Grands Prix.[38] Hamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone.[39] Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds. This would have been 16 but for being disqualified from one win at Spa-Francorchamps on a technical infringement that caught out several other drivers.[15] He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort.[40] After the season British magazine Autosport featured him in their \"Top 50 Drivers of 2005\" issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.[41] Due to his success in Formula Three, he moved to ASM's sister GP2 team ART Grand Prix for 2006.[42] Like their sister team in F3, ART were the leaders of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with Nico Rosberg.[43] Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet, Jr. and Timo Glock.[44] His performances included a dominant win at the N\u00fcrburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane.[45] At his home race at Silverstone, supporting the British Grand Prix, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare.[46] In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take second.[47] Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race. In the sprint race, though he finished second with Piquet sixth, he was 12 points clear of his rival.[48] His success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to Ferrari.[49][50] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with defending champion Fernando Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.[51] He was told of McLaren's decision at the end of September, but the news was not made public for almost two months, for fear that it would be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.[52] Hamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. After finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers' Championship to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point, including those for the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the joint most wins in a debut season (4) and the most points in a debut season (109). Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in a number of incidents which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Following a successful first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012.[53] Hamilton's success continued in 2008. He amassed five victories and ten podium finishes, but was also accused of arrogance and dangerous driving, though he argued that his self-belief was wrongly interpreted and that his driving was firm but fair. As the season reached its conclusion in Brazil, it became a clear two-way fight for the title between the home-favourite Felipe Massa and the young Briton. Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion; on the last corner of the last lap in the last race of the season, becoming the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history as he denied race-winner Massa the title by one point.[54][55] This made Hamilton the first British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.[56] In his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories, but a culmination of less competitive machinery and a self-confessed loss of focus saw him fail to finish higher than fourth in the drivers' standings. Hamilton entered the final round of the 2010 season with a chance of winning the title, but ultimately finished fourth as Sebastian Vettel won the race to take his maiden drivers' crown. The following year was the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson Button finished runner-up to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in his private life and run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he would return to form for 2012. Keeping to his word, Hamilton achieved four race-wins in the 2012 season as he finished fourth in the standings. Before the end of the year, Hamilton announced, to much surprise, that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season, replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher.[57] Upon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble.[58][59] In his first season with the silver arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen,[60] alongside a number of podium finishes and pole positions, finishing fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.[57] Changes to regulations ahead of the 2014 season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton as he found himself in the most dominant car on the grid. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. Clinching his second drivers' title, and eclipsing the victory tally of all British drivers before him, Hamilton declared over team-radio after the final race in Abu Dhabi, \"This is the greatest day of my life\".[57] New driver number regulations brought in for 2014 allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for their entire career, and so Hamilton elected to drive under his old karting number, 44, for the remainder of his career.[61] Ahead of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career number 44. It was the first season since 1994, when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title in 1993, that the field would not contain car bearing the number 1.[62] Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships titles. The rivalry between him and Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the US Grand Prix where Hamilton won in an action-packed, wheel-to-wheel battle with his teammate to clinch the title with three races to spare.[57] That year, Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One,[63][64] as well as allowing Hamilton to retain his own image rights, which is considered unusual in the sport, and keep his championship winning cars and trophies.[65] Despite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other driver in 2016, Hamilton lost the drivers' title by five points to his teammate, Rosberg. The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely led to a number of acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track, culminating in Hamilton defying team-orders at the season finale in Abu Dhabi and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win the title.[66] Ultimately, a lack of reliability and a handful of driving errors from Hamilton helped Rosberg get closer than in previous years, and a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia allowed the title to fall into Rosberg's hands, which he successfully secured before announcing his shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his rival.[57][67] Following Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare.[57] The 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the Fight for Five by journalists and fans.[68][69][70] As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408).[57][67] During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.[71] Having signed a contract with Mercedes that lasts until 2020, it was confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019.[72] Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the Honda-powered Red Rull of Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Leclerc, to clinch his sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.[73][74] After scoring his sixth career grand slam in the final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins (matching his previous best in 2014 and 2018) and 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole positions.[75] His total of 413 points for the season was a new all-time record, seeing the Briton finish 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.[76] Hamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid.[77] The all-time record holder for most pole positions, Hamilton is considered one of the fastest qualifiers in the history of the sport,[77] and has received praise for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments.[78] Also a tenacious racer, he excels across a wide range of areas.[79] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[80] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.[81][82] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[81] Hamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car.[83] Hamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[84][85] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[86] Hamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017\u20132018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run only brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error.[87][88] Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion\".[89] Ayrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style. \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there\".[90] He has been compared to Senna in raw speed.[91] In 2010, Hamilton drove Ayrton Senna's original title winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show, Top Gear. In the documentary, Hamilton, along with fellow racing drivers, name Senna as the number one driver ever.[92][93] Earlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he would go on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia.[94] Following his move to Mercedes, however, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".[57] \u2014Bernie Ecclestone, speaking of Hamilton in 2015.[95] Hamilton is often considered the best driver of his generation,[96][97][98][99] and widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the history of the sport.[100][101][102][103][104][105] Often considered among the greatest British drivers in Formula One, and as one of the greatest British sportsmen ever,[106] Hamilton is the most successful British driver in the sport, having more race victories than any other British driver in the history of Formula One and holding a record six British Grand Prix victories.[107][108] Despite receiving widespread plaudits from experts and fans both in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track are under-appreciated by some.[109][110] Jim Holder of Autocar magazine has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance\u2014being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, dreadlocks and designer clothing\u2014alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase.[106] Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.[111][106] \u2014David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of Hamilton in 2019.[112] Hamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have received criticism,[113] although he has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion, and has been described as one of the last 'superstar' drivers.[114][111] For example, between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore.[114] Team boss, Toto Wolff, has been consistenly vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.[109] Figures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport through his lifestyle, noting how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers.[113] Since Hamilton's rookie season in 2007, Formula One's annual global revenue rose by 53%, to $1.83\u00a0billion as of 31 July 2016.[96] Sports journalist for The Telegraph, Luke Slater, goes as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\"[115] \u2014Fernando Alonso, speaking of Hamilton in 2017.[116] A prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation.[117] Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport.[118] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in thirteen consecutive seasons,[104] attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.[116][119] After Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\",[97] an opinion which was more widely accepted amongst the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers.[96] As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status amongst the greatest drivers in history.[118] The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history.[120] After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals and teammates alike,[104][116][121][122][103] with some journalists and pundits considering the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[123][124] Following Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever,[125] a sentiment echoed by his Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff, who described him as \"maybe the best driver that has ever existed\",[109] while Formula One staff writer, Greg Stuart, described Hamiton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\".[77] From a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[126] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach.[127] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[128] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars \u2013 one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time \u2013 on either side.[129] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet upon winning further World Championship titles.[130] Hamilton has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout his career. At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top.[131] At the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton brought with him a striking blue-and-green design \u2013 in honour of team sponsor, Petronas \u2013 but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[127] Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, Hamilton entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words \"World Champion\".[132] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his fifth world title, toward which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[130] and did so again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following his sixth World Championship title.[133] Hamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[134] At the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda, who passed away at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back. After the race, Hamilton reflected on Lauda's career, saying \"Ultimately, as a driver, my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely someone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\"[135] Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix.[136] Hamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion, Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second at Monaco in 2007.[137] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.[138] McLaren denied favouring double world champion Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result\".[138] Tensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton was delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session.[139] Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[140] Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[141] British motorsport journal Autosport claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\",[142] however McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton which denied the use of any profanity.[143] As a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.[144][145] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008.[146] The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[147][148][149] Alonso and McLaren subsequently terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[150] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[151] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that\".[116] Alonso would later describe Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time.[103] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before retirement in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[152] In their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season. Hamilton had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Alonso 10 times. Alonso also had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes but qualified ahead of Hamilton only 7 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.[153] When Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[154] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time\".[155] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings:[155] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing.[17] Pundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability while labelling Rosberg, while not as quick, as the more intelligent driver.[94] Their old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical.[17] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management and moderate fuel usage.[94] However, Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it\".[79][156] In their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times. Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[157] In 2015, Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of \u00a388\u00a0million.[158] In 2018, it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of \u00a3159\u00a0million.[159] Hamilton is currently the best-paid driver in Formula One, and since joining Mercedes in 2013 has been one of the highest-paid drivers on the grid. Ahead of the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a contract to stay with Mercedes until the end of the 2018 season in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million over the three years, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One.[63] In the week leading up to the 2018 German Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making Hamilton the best-paid driver in the history of Formula One.[71] In December 2017, Hamilton courted controversy after sharing a video on Instagram of his nephew wearing a princess dress in which he commented \"Why did you ask for a princess dress for Christmas, boys don't wear princess dresses\".[160] He was condemned on social media and by LGBT charities for his comments.[161][162] He subsequently deleted the video before later deleting all content from his social media channels,[163] though he returned to actively using his social media accounts on 17 January 2018.[164] Hamilton apologised for his comments, and later appeared at Disneyland Paris with his nephew, who wore a princess dress for the trip, as well as featuring on the front cover of GQ wearing a rainbow tartan kilt he designed with Tommy Hilfiger, saying \"I\u2019ve done something and then realised the effect I\u2019ve had ... I want to make amends. I accept it, realise it and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m accountable for it\".[165] In December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and noted that people felt \"very offended\".[166] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always. [...] Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\"[167] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".[168] \u2014Hamilton in 2017 commenting on his influence on minority representation in Formula One.[169] The first and only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [sic]\".[170] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour[171] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign.[172] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York\u2013based advertising agency TBWA and named \"pinchalaruedadeHamilton\", which translates into English as 'burst Hamilton's tyre', was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults.[173] Hamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, The Guardian journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance amongst the British public.[174] In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button.[175] At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\",[176] and changed his approach to embrace his position and promote equality within the sport.[177] Hamilton has since questioned racial politics in Formula One on a number of occasions. In 2011, after being summoned to the stewards in five out of the first six races of the season, Hamilton quipped: \"Maybe it's because I'm black, that's what Ali G says\".[178] In 2018, Hamilton criticised the lack of diversity in Formula One, describing how nothing had changed in his eleven years in the sport before saying \"Kids, people, there are so many jobs in this sport of which anybody, no matter your ethnicity or background, can make it and fit in\".[179][180] In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.[181] Hamilton announced his intention to live in Switzerland in 2007, stating that this was because he wished to get away from the media scrutiny that he experienced living in the UK. He said on the television show Parkinson that taxation was also a reason.[182] He settled in Luins in Vaud canton on Lake Geneva.[183][184] In 2010, Hamilton joined many Formula One drivers past and present when he moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported \u00a310\u00a0million, where he still resides as of 2018. Hamilton also owns a flat in New York, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would like to live after his retirement.[185] Hamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out for criticism in a report by the social-justice[186] charity Christian Aid in 2008.[187][188][189] The same year, Hamilton received public criticism from UK members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes.[190] Following the leak of the confidential Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying \u00a33.3\u00a0million of value added tax (VAT) on his Challenger 605 private jet worth \u00a316.5\u00a0million.[191] According to BBC Panorama, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be artificial and not to comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use.[191] The BBC also said that Hamilton's social media accounts provide evidence that he has used his jet for holidays and other personal trips.[191] The jet was sold in September 2019.[192] In January 2020, Hamilton pledged to donate US$500,000 (approximately \u00a3383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the ongoing bushfire crisis in Australia. The money is intended to go towards the fire services and animal welfare charities.[193] Hamilton also has interests in music, saying \"[m]usic has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was 13. In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable. I can show a side of me that people don't get to see\". He reportedly features on Christina Aguilera's song \"Pipe\" under the pseudonym 'XNDA'[194] although Hamilton has not confirmed this is true.[195] Hamilton is a fan of art, and has said that one of his favourite artists is Andy Warhol.[196] Prior to the 2014 United States Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a gold-framed version of Warhol's Cars, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupe painting hanging from a chain around his neck.[197] Hamilton also made a guest appearance in the film Cars 2 in which he voices an anthropomorphic version of himself.[198] Hamilton is credited as an executive producer for the 2018 documentary film The Game Changers.[199] In 2018 Hamilton launched a clothing line, TOMMYXLEWIS, during New York Fashion Week with American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger alongside models Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin.[200] Hamilton stated \"[g]rowing up, I remember seeing the iconic Tommy Hilfiger flag\" and Hilfiger commented on Hamilton, saying \"Lewis is bold in everything he does ... He's not afraid to take risks. And he has a cool and sophisticated style that really speaks to the new generation of Tommy fans\".[201] In 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because, \"[a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"[202] In 2018, Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\".[203] In November 2007, Hamilton started dating Nicole Scherzinger, the lead singer of the American girl band Pussycat Dolls. Although it was announced in January 2010 that they split up to focus on their respective careers, they were seen together at that year's Turkish and Canadian Grands Prix.[204][205] The couple split up and reunited numerous times between 2011 and 2015,[206][207] before finally splitting up in February 2015.[208] Hamilton owns two unrestored 1967 AC Cobras, one black and one red,[209] and in February 2015, it was reported that Hamilton had purchased a Ferrari LaFerrari from \"his rivals in Maranello.\"[210] On 18 December 2007, Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month after being caught speeding at 196\u00a0km/h (122\u00a0mph) on a French motorway. His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded.[211][212] Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton \"deliberately losing traction\" in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours. Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for \"driving in an over-exuberant manner\". After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (\u00a3288), being described as a \"hoon\" [boy racer] by the magistrate.[213][214][215] * Season still in progress (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap) (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap) (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap) * Season still in progress. \u2020 Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance. \u2021 Half points awarded as less than 75% of race distance was completed.

A six-time Formula One World Champion, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of the sport, and considered by some to be the greatest of all time.[note 2] He won his first World Drivers' Championship with McLaren in 2008, before moving to Mercedes in 2013, with whom he has won a further five titles. One of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport, Hamilton's six World Championship titles is the second-most of all time, as is his tally of 84 race victories and 151 podium finishes. He currently holds the records for the all-time most career points (3431), the all-time most pole positions (88), the most grand slams in a season (3) and the most points in a season (413).[note 3]\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton enjoyed a successful ascent up the racing ladder and was signed to the McLaren young driver programme in 1998. This later resulted in a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007, making Hamilton the first and only black driver to race in the sport.[note 4] That season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\u2014making a crucial overtake on the last corner of the last lap in the last race of the season\u2014to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history. After four more years with McLaren without finishing higher than fourth in the drivers' standings, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013, reuniting with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg.\nChanges to regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines contributed to the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he has won five further World Championship titles. Hamilton won consecutive titles in 2014 and 2015 during an intense and sometimes volatile rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg, to match his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships. Following Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two intense championship battles, and Hamilton twice overturned mid-season points deficits to claim consecutive titles for the second time in his career in 2017 and 2018. A third World Drivers' Championship followed in 2019 to complete a hat-trick of consecutive titles, bringing his tally to six overall, second only to seven-time World Drivers' Champion Michael Schumacher.\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle and other ventures, including his environmental activism and exploits in music and fashion. Hamilton has been targeted by racist abuse throughout his career, and has been outspoken in his criticism of racial politics in Formula One as well as calling for greater diversity in the sport. His treatment by British newspapers has also been criticised for carrying racial bias, and some have pointed to Hamilton's race and physical appearance as reasons behind his perceived unpopularity among a portion of motorsport fans.\nHamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England.[2] Hamilton's mother, Carmen (Larbalestier), is white British, while his father, Anthony Hamilton, is black British, making him mixed-race;[8] he self-identifies as black.[9] Lewis's parents separated when he was two and, as a result of this, he lived with his mother and half-sisters until he was twelve.[10] He then moved to live with his father, stepmother Linda and half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver and has cerebral palsy.[11] Hamilton was raised a Roman Catholic.[12]\nAt the age of five Hamilton took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school;[13] later, he learned to ride a unicycle, as part of his karting rivalry with future Formula One Mercedes teammate, Nico Rosberg, who could already ride one.[14] Hamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car in 1991, which gave him his first taste of racing competition before finishing second in the national BRCA championship the following year. He said of the time: \"I was racing these remote-controlled cars and winning club championships against adults\".[15] His father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when Hamilton was six[16] and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school. To support his son, Anthony took redundancy from his position as an information technology manager and became a contractor; sometimes working up to three jobs at a time, while still attending all his son's races. Anthony later set up his own computer company, still managing Lewis;[17] Hamilton would later end his working relationship with his father in early 2010.[18]\nLewis Hamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.[19] In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young.[17] Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams.[20] In February 2001 he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.[21]\nHamilton began karting in 1993, when he was eight,[22] at the Rye House Kart Circuit[23] and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships. Two years later, he approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis for an autograph, and told him, \"Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.\" Dennis wrote in his autograph book, \"Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then.\" Hamilton drove for Martin Hines's Zip Young Guns Karting Team.[24] By the age of 12, his driving skill was high enough that Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One Grand Prix before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25.[25] He progressed through to Junior Yamaha in 1997, and in 1998, Dennis called Hamilton after he won an additional Super One series and his second British championship.[15] Dennis delivered on his promise and signed Hamilton to the McLaren driver development programme.[8] The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract which later resulted in a Formula One drive.[22]\n\u2014Michael Schumacher, speaking about Hamilton in 2001.[26]\nHamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers' Club made him a \"Rising Star\" Member in 2000.[27] In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton (see quote box).[28]\nHamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series. Despite crashing on his third lap in the car in testing, he finished fifth overall in the winter series.[15] This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished third overall with three wins and three pole positions.[29] He remained with Manor for another year and won the championship with ten wins and 419 points to the two wins and 377 points of his nearest rival, Alex Lloyd.[30] Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship.[31] In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,[32] and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.[33]\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was \"not to be the youngest in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One\".[34] Later in 2004, Williams would announce that they had come close to signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[35] He eventually re-signed with McLaren, and made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series. They won one race and Hamilton ended the year fifth in the championship.[36] He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix[37] and raced one of the Macau F3 Grands Prix.[38]\nHamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone.[39] Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds. This would have been 16 but for being disqualified from one win at Spa-Francorchamps on a technical infringement that caught out several other drivers.[15] He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort.[40] After the season British magazine Autosport featured him in their \"Top 50 Drivers of 2005\" issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.[41]\nDue to his success in Formula Three, he moved to ASM's sister GP2 team ART Grand Prix for 2006.[42] Like their sister team in F3, ART were the leaders of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with Nico Rosberg.[43] Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet, Jr. and Timo Glock.[44] His performances included a dominant win at the N\u00fcrburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane.[45] At his home race at Silverstone, supporting the British Grand Prix, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare.[46] In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take second.[47] Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race. In the sprint race, though he finished second with Piquet sixth, he was 12 points clear of his rival.[48] His success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to Ferrari.[49][50] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with defending champion Fernando Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.[51] He was told of McLaren's decision at the end of September, but the news was not made public for almost two months, for fear that it would be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.[52]\nHamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. After finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers' Championship to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point, including those for the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the joint most wins in a debut season (4) and the most points in a debut season (109). Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in a number of incidents which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Following a successful first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012.[53]\nHamilton's success continued in 2008. He amassed five victories and ten podium finishes, but was also accused of arrogance and dangerous driving, though he argued that his self-belief was wrongly interpreted and that his driving was firm but fair. As the season reached its conclusion in Brazil, it became a clear two-way fight for the title between the home-favourite Felipe Massa and the young Briton. Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion; on the last corner of the last lap in the last race of the season, becoming the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history as he denied race-winner Massa the title by one point.[54][55] This made Hamilton the first British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.[56]\nIn his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories, but a culmination of less competitive machinery and a self-confessed loss of focus saw him fail to finish higher than fourth in the drivers' standings. Hamilton entered the final round of the 2010 season with a chance of winning the title, but ultimately finished fourth as Sebastian Vettel won the race to take his maiden drivers' crown. The following year was the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson Button finished runner-up to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in his private life and run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he would return to form for 2012. Keeping to his word, Hamilton achieved four race-wins in the 2012 season as he finished fourth in the standings. Before the end of the year, Hamilton announced, to much surprise, that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season, replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher.[57]\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble.[58][59] In his first season with the silver arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen,[60] alongside a number of podium finishes and pole positions, finishing fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.[57]\nChanges to regulations ahead of the 2014 season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton as he found himself in the most dominant car on the grid. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. Clinching his second drivers' title, and eclipsing the victory tally of all British drivers before him, Hamilton declared over team-radio after the final race in Abu Dhabi, \"This is the greatest day of my life\".[57] New driver number regulations brought in for 2014 allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for their entire career, and so Hamilton elected to drive under his old karting number, 44, for the remainder of his career.[61]\nAhead of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career number 44. It was the first season since 1994, when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title in 1993, that the field would not contain car bearing the number 1.[62] Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships titles. The rivalry between him and Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the US Grand Prix where Hamilton won in an action-packed, wheel-to-wheel battle with his teammate to clinch the title with three races to spare.[57] That year, Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One,[63][64] as well as allowing Hamilton to retain his own image rights, which is considered unusual in the sport, and keep his championship winning cars and trophies.[65]\nDespite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other driver in 2016, Hamilton lost the drivers' title by five points to his teammate, Rosberg. The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely led to a number of acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track, culminating in Hamilton defying team-orders at the season finale in Abu Dhabi and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win the title.[66] Ultimately, a lack of reliability and a handful of driving errors from Hamilton helped Rosberg get closer than in previous years, and a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia allowed the title to fall into Rosberg's hands, which he successfully secured before announcing his shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his rival.[57][67]\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare.[57]\nThe 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the Fight for Five by journalists and fans.[68][69][70] As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408).[57][67] During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.[71]\nHaving signed a contract with Mercedes that lasts until 2020, it was confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019.[72] Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the Honda-powered Red Rull of Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Leclerc, to clinch his sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.[73][74] After scoring his sixth career grand slam in the final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins (matching his previous best in 2014 and 2018) and 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole positions.[75] His total of 413 points for the season was a new all-time record, seeing the Briton finish 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.[76]\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid.[77] The all-time record holder for most pole positions, Hamilton is considered one of the fastest qualifiers in the history of the sport,[77] and has received praise for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments.[78] Also a tenacious racer, he excels across a wide range of areas.[79] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[80] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.[81][82] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[81] Hamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car.[83]\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[84][85] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[86] Hamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017\u20132018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run only brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error.[87][88] Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion\".[89]\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style. \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there\".[90] He has been compared to Senna in raw speed.[91] In 2010, Hamilton drove Ayrton Senna's original title winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show, Top Gear. In the documentary, Hamilton, along with fellow racing drivers, name Senna as the number one driver ever.[92][93]\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he would go on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia.[94] Following his move to Mercedes, however, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".[57]\n\u2014Bernie Ecclestone, speaking of Hamilton in 2015.[95]\nHamilton is often considered the best driver of his generation,[96][97][98][99] and widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the history of the sport.[100][101][102][103][104][105] Often considered among the greatest British drivers in Formula One, and as one of the greatest British sportsmen ever,[106] Hamilton is the most successful British driver in the sport, having more race victories than any other British driver in the history of Formula One and holding a record six British Grand Prix victories.[107][108] Despite receiving widespread plaudits from experts and fans both in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track are under-appreciated by some.[109][110] Jim Holder of Autocar magazine has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance\u2014being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, dreadlocks and designer clothing\u2014alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase.[106] Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.[111][106]\n\u2014David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of Hamilton in 2019.[112]\nHamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have received criticism,[113] although he has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion, and has been described as one of the last 'superstar' drivers.[114][111] For example, between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore.[114] Team boss, Toto Wolff, has been consistenly vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.[109] Figures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport through his lifestyle, noting how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers.[113] Since Hamilton's rookie season in 2007, Formula One's annual global revenue rose by 53%, to $1.83\u00a0billion as of 31 July 2016.[96] Sports journalist for The Telegraph, Luke Slater, goes as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\"[115]\n\u2014Fernando Alonso, speaking of Hamilton in 2017.[116]\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation.[117] Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport.[118] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in thirteen consecutive seasons,[104] attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.[116][119]\n After Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\",[97] an opinion which was more widely accepted amongst the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers.[96] As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status amongst the greatest drivers in history.[118] The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history.[120] After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals and teammates alike,[104][116][121][122][103] with some journalists and pundits considering the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[123][124] Following Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever,[125] a sentiment echoed by his Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff, who described him as \"maybe the best driver that has ever existed\",[109] while Formula One staff writer, Greg Stuart, described Hamiton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\".[77]\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[126] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach.[127] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[128] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars \u2013 one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time \u2013 on either side.[129] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet upon winning further World Championship titles.[130]\nHamilton has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout his career. At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top.[131] At the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton brought with him a striking blue-and-green design \u2013 in honour of team sponsor, Petronas \u2013 but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[127] Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, Hamilton entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words \"World Champion\".[132] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his fifth world title, toward which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[130] and did so again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following his sixth World Championship title.[133]\nHamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[134] At the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda, who passed away at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back. After the race, Hamilton reflected on Lauda's career, saying \"Ultimately, as a driver, my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely someone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\"[135] Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix.[136]\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion, Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second at Monaco in 2007.[137] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.[138] McLaren denied favouring double world champion Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result\".[138]\nTensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton was delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session.[139] Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[140] Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[141] British motorsport journal Autosport claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\",[142] however McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton which denied the use of any profanity.[143]\nAs a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.[144][145] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008.[146] The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[147][148][149] Alonso and McLaren subsequently terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[150] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[151] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that\".[116] Alonso would later describe Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time.[103] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before retirement in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[152]\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season. Hamilton had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Alonso 10 times. Alonso also had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes but qualified ahead of Hamilton only 7 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.[153]\nWhen Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[154] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time\".[155] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings:[155] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing.[17]\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability while labelling Rosberg, while not as quick, as the more intelligent driver.[94] Their old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical.[17] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management and moderate fuel usage.[94] However, Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it\".[79][156]\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times. Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[157]\nIn 2015, Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of \u00a388\u00a0million.[158] In 2018, it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of \u00a3159\u00a0million.[159] Hamilton is currently the best-paid driver in Formula One, and since joining Mercedes in 2013 has been one of the highest-paid drivers on the grid. Ahead of the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a contract to stay with Mercedes until the end of the 2018 season in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100\u00a0million over the three years, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One.[63] In the week leading up to the 2018 German Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340\u00a0million per year, making Hamilton the best-paid driver in the history of Formula One.[71]\nIn December 2017, Hamilton courted controversy after sharing a video on Instagram of his nephew wearing a princess dress in which he commented \"Why did you ask for a princess dress for Christmas, boys don't wear princess dresses\".[160] He was condemned on social media and by LGBT charities for his comments.[161][162] He subsequently deleted the video before later deleting all content from his social media channels,[163] though he returned to actively using his social media accounts on 17 January 2018.[164] Hamilton apologised for his comments, and later appeared at Disneyland Paris with his nephew, who wore a princess dress for the trip, as well as featuring on the front cover of GQ wearing a rainbow tartan kilt he designed with Tommy Hilfiger, saying \"I\u2019ve done something and then realised the effect I\u2019ve had ... I want to make amends. I accept it, realise it and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m accountable for it\".[165]\nIn December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and noted that people felt \"very offended\".[166] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always. [...] Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\"[167] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".[168]\n\u2014Hamilton in 2017 commenting on his influence on minority representation in Formula One.[169]\nThe first and only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [sic]\".[170] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour[171] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign.[172] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York\u2013based advertising agency TBWA and named \"pinchalaruedadeHamilton\", which translates into English as 'burst Hamilton's tyre', was featured in the British media.

Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults.[173]\nHamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, The Guardian journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance amongst the British public.[174] In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button.[175] At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\",[176] and changed his approach to embrace his position and promote equality within the sport.[177] Hamilton has since questioned racial politics in Formula One on a number of occasions. In 2011, after being summoned to the stewards in five out of the first six races of the season, Hamilton quipped: \"Maybe it's because I'm black, that's what Ali G says\".[178] In 2018, Hamilton criticised the lack of diversity in Formula One, describing how nothing had changed in his eleven years in the sport before saying \"Kids, people, there are so many jobs in this sport of which anybody, no matter your ethnicity or background, can make it and fit in\".[179][180] In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.[181]\nHamilton announced his intention to live in Switzerland in 2007, stating that this was because he wished to get away from the media scrutiny that he experienced living in the UK. He said on the television show Parkinson that taxation was also a reason.[182] He settled in Luins in Vaud canton on Lake Geneva.[183][184] In 2010, Hamilton joined many Formula One drivers past and present when he moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported \u00a310\u00a0million, where he still resides as of 2018. Hamilton also owns a flat in New York, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would like to live after his retirement.[185]\nHamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out for criticism in a report by the social-justice[186] charity Christian Aid in 2008.[187][188][189] The same year, Hamilton received public criticism from UK members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes.[190] Following the leak of the confidential Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying \u00a33.3\u00a0million of value added tax (VAT) on his Challenger 605 private jet worth \u00a316.5\u00a0million.[191] According to BBC Panorama, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be artificial and not to comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use.[191] The BBC also said that Hamilton's social media accounts provide evidence that he has used his jet for holidays and other personal trips.[191] The jet was sold in September 2019.[192]\nIn January 2020, Hamilton pledged to donate US$500,000 (approximately \u00a3383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the ongoing bushfire crisis in Australia. The money is intended to go towards the fire services and animal welfare charities.[193]\nHamilton also has interests in music, saying \"[m]usic has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was 13. In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable. I can show a side of me that people don't get to see\". He reportedly features on Christina Aguilera's song \"Pipe\" under the pseudonym 'XNDA'[194] although Hamilton has not confirmed this is true.[195]\nHamilton is a fan of art, and has said that one of his favourite artists is Andy Warhol.[196] Prior to the 2014 United States Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a gold-framed version of Warhol's Cars, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupe painting hanging from a chain around his neck.[197]\nHamilton also made a guest appearance in the film Cars 2 in which he voices an anthropomorphic version of himself.[198]\nHamilton is credited as an executive producer for the 2018 documentary film The Game Changers.[199]\nIn 2018 Hamilton launched a clothing line, TOMMYXLEWIS, during New York Fashion Week with American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger alongside models Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin.[200] Hamilton stated \"[g]rowing up, I remember seeing the iconic Tommy Hilfiger flag\" and Hilfiger commented on Hamilton, saying \"Lewis is bold in everything he does ... He's not afraid to take risks. And he has a cool and sophisticated style that really speaks to the new generation of Tommy fans\".[201]\nIn 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because, \"[a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"[202] In 2018, Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\".[203]\nIn November 2007, Hamilton started dating Nicole Scherzinger, the lead singer of the American girl band Pussycat Dolls. Although it was announced in January 2010 that they split up to focus on their respective careers, they were seen together at that year's Turkish and Canadian Grands Prix.[204][205] The couple split up and reunited numerous times between 2011 and 2015,[206][207] before finally splitting up in February 2015.[208]\nHamilton owns two unrestored 1967 AC Cobras, one black and one red,[209] and in February 2015, it was reported that Hamilton had purchased a Ferrari LaFerrari from \"his rivals in Maranello.\"[210] On 18 December 2007, Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month after being caught speeding at 196\u00a0km/h (122\u00a0mph) on a French motorway. His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded.[211][212] Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton \"deliberately losing traction\" in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours. Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for \"driving in an over-exuberant manner\". After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (\u00a3288), being described as a \"hoon\" [boy racer] by the magistrate.[213][214][215]\n* Season still in progress\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n* Season still in progress.\n\u2020 Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.\n\u2021 Half points awarded as less than 75% of race distance was completed.\nMercedes\nIndividual\nOrders\nItalics indicate factory team.\n1950\u00a0 G.

                "text": "no title\n\nHillary Diane Rodham Clinton[2] (n\u00e9e Rodham; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer, and public speaker. She served as First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, as a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and as the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to Donald Trump. Raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As First Lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the Clinton health care plan\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York. She was re-elected in 2006. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was damaged in the September 11 attacks.[3] In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. Clinton was U.S. secretary of state in the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya. She was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Her use of a private e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the e-mail controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election. Upon leaving her Cabinet position after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements. Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016. After winning the Democratic nomination, she ran in the general election with Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. Clinton lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the Electoral College despite winning a plurality of the popular vote. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups. Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois.[4][5] She was raised in a United Methodist family who first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[6] Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent,[7] and managed a small but successful textile business, which he had founded.[8] Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[7][9][10] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[11] As a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools she attended in Park Ridge.[12] She participated in swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[12] She has often told the story[13][14][15] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[16] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council and school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[4][17] She was elected class vice president for her junior year but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that \"you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president\".[18] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then-new Maine South High School. There she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted \"most likely to succeed.\" She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class.[19] Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career.[10] Her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[20] She was raised in a politically conservative household,[10] and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon,[21] and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[22] Rodham's early political development was shaped mostly by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[23] In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[24][25] During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[26][27] As the leader of this \"Rockefeller Republican\"-oriented group,[28] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[29] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[26] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as \"a mind conservative and a heart liberal\".[30] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[31][32] By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[33] In early 1968 she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association, a position she held until early 1969.[31][34] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[33] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[31][35] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female president of the United States.[31] To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the \"Wellesley in Washington\" summer program.[33] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[33] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's \"veiled\" racist messages, and she left the Republican Party for good.[33] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[36] (Years later, while she was the first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[36]) In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[37] with departmental honors in political science.[36] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of the commencement speaker, Senator Edward Brooke.[34][38] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[31][39][40] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[41][42] because of the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[38] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[43] She was asked to speak at the 50th anniversary convention of the League of Women Voters in Washington, D.C., the next year.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).[45] Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital,[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey. Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52] In the spring of 1971, she began dating fellow law student Bill Clinton. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans and moved to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[37] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation, but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59] Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, \"Children Under the Law\", was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children's rights movement, the article stated that \"child citizens\" were \"powerless individuals\"[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence on a case-by-case basis, except when there is evidence otherwise.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64] During her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for it.[67] The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67] By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.[68] Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him, but she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, \"I chose to follow my heart instead of my head\".[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74] At the university, Rodham taught classes in criminal law. She was considered a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] Rodham became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] As a court-appointed lawyer, Rodham was required to act as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl; after her request to be relieved of the assignment failed, Rodham used an effective defense and counseled her client to plead guilty to a lesser charge. She has called the trial a \"terrible case\".[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about getting married; she was concerned that her separate identity would be lost, and that her accomplishments would be viewed in light of someone else.[78] In 1974, Bill Clinton lost an Arkansas congressional race, facing incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt.[79] Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she agreed to marry him.[80] The wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[81] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she decided to retain the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] Her motivation was threefold. She wanted to keep the couple's professional lives separate, avoid apparent conflicts of interest, and as she told a friend at the time, \"it showed that I was still me\".[83] The decision upset both mothers, who were more traditional.[84] In 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[85][86] In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[79] In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[87] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while working pro bono in child advocacy;[88] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[89] Rodham maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles \"Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect\" in 1977[90] and \"Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective\" in 1979.[91] The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, \"Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.\"[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as \"one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades\".[92] Conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[93] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[94] In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[46][96] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[97] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation.[98] She held that position from 1978 until the end of 1981.[99] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to hold the job.[100] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90\u00a0million to $300\u00a0million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[88] Following her husband's November 1978 election as governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's first lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979\u201381, 1983\u201392). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[101] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.[102] In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner in Rose Law Firm.[103] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[104] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[105] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[106] At this time, the couple began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[105] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s. On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[107] Two years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to his job as governor of Arkansas after he won the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name \"Hillary Clinton\", or sometimes \"Mrs. Bill Clinton\", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[108] During her second stint as the first lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system.[114][115] In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[101][114] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][114] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[116] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[117][118] Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was the first lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours[119] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[120] The firm considered her a \"rainmaker\" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[120] Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[121] From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[122] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[123] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[124] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America\u2014in 1988 and in 1991.[125] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running. Private polls were unfavorable, however, and in the end he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[126] Clinton was chairman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund[4][127] and on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Legal Services (1988\u201392)[128] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985\u201392),[129] Wal-Mart Stores (1986\u201392)[130] and Lafarge (1990\u201392).[131] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[120][132] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[132] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.[130][132][133] According to Dan Kaufman, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump.[134][135] Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[136] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged \"causing pain in my marriage\".[137] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[138] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song \"Stand by Your Man\".[d] Later in the campaign, she commented she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers. In retrospect she admitted they were ill-considered. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would \"get two for the price of one\", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[144] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[93] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[145] When Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady. Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[146] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][147] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration. Her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[148] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[149][150] Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors, and that voters had been well aware she would play an active role in her husband's presidency.[151] Bill Clinton's campaign promise of \"two for the price of one\" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as \"co-presidents\" or sometimes use the Arkansas label \"Billary\".[101][152][153] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into \"imaginary discussions\" with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[157][158] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's \"politics of meaning\" to overcome what she saw as America's \"sleeping sickness of the soul\"; that would lead to a willingness \"to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium\".[159][160] In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[161] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[162][163] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as \"Hillarycare\" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress.[164] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[164] Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[165] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors. The first lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50 percent range during her first year, fell to 44\u00a0percent in April 1994 and 35\u00a0percent by September 1994.[166] Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[167] They saw a net gain of 54 seats in the House election and eight in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.[168] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.[169] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use \"Hillarycare\" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[170] Along with senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. This federal bill gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage. She conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[171] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[172] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. She worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60] Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency. When the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress lacking protections for people coming off welfare, however, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[173][174] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[173] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[173][174] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called \"sad and painful\".[174] Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as the first lady.[60][175] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[175] As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences. These included one on Child Care (1997),[176] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[177] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[178] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000),[179] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[180] Clinton traveled to 79\u00a0countries during this time,[181] breaking the record for most-traveled first lady previously held by Pat Nixon.[182] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[183] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department, without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[184] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited, and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[185] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[186] In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People's Republic of China itself. She declared, \"it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights\".[187] Delegates from over 180\u00a0countries heard her say: \"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all.\"[188] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[181][188] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases.[189] During the late 1990s, she was one of the most prominent international figures to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[190][191] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[192] It and Clinton's own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[193] Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press. The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from its publication in a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[194] and throughout her time as the first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[195] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed, and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators her husband had appointed.[194] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[196] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[197][198] After a two-year search, the records were found in the first lady's White House book room and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[198] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[198] Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion.[199] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first spouse of a U.S. president to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[197] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[200] Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an action that became known as \"Travelgate\", began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[201] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo led to the investigation being focused on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[202][203] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made \"factually false\" statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[204] In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed that Clinton had earned spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978\u201379.[205] The press made allegations that Clinton had engaged in a conflict of interest and disguised a bribery. Several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[206] An outgrowth of the \"Travelgate\" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called \"Filegate\".[207] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[208] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[207] In early 2001, a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House; there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons' personal property. During the last year of Bill Clinton's time in office, those gifts were shipped to the Clintons' private residence.[209][210] In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book,[211] although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies.[212][213] The book spent 18\u00a0weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one.[214] By 2000, it had sold 450,000\u00a0copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback.[215] Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording.[216] She was the first president's wife to win a Grammy Award.[217] In 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[218] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\".[219][220] She characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.[222] After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage. Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage.[223] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[224] Public reaction varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions. They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[225] In the wake of the revelations, her public approval ratings shot upward to around 70\u00a0percent, the highest they had ever been.[225] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to \"a love that has persisted for decades\" and add: \"No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.\"[226] Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills. In 2014, Hillary would say she and Bill had left the White House \"not only dead broke, but in debt\". The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who give paid speeches after leaving office. The couple would also have the ability to secure loans from banks.[227] Other books published by Clinton when she was the first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children's book Beatrice's Goat.[228] She was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites.[229] This included the flag that inspired \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She also published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled \"Talking It Over\" from 1995 to 2000.[230][231] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.[4] She was head of the White House Millennium Council[232] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[233] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned by museums.[234] In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe,[235] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[236] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[237] These included changing of the Treaty Room and a presidential study to have a 19th-century look.[236] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[237] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60] When New York's long-serving U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[238] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[239] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[240] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani\u2014the mayor of New York City\u2014as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public. Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.[241] Bill de Blasio was Clinton's campaign manager. She began her drive to the U.S. Senate by visiting all 62 counties in the state, in a \"listening tour\" of small-group settings.[242] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000\u00a0jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[243] The contest drew national attention. During a September debate, Lazio blundered when he seemed to invade Clinton's personal space by trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[244] Their campaigns, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90\u00a0million.[245] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55\u00a0percent of the vote to Lazio's 43\u00a0percent.[244] She was sworn in as U.S. senator on January 3, 2001.[246] Publisher Simon & Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8\u00a0million in December 2000 for her autobiography, released in 2003, as Living History.[247] Upon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.[248] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[157][249] She sat on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001\u201302),[250] Committee on Armed Services (2003\u201309),[251] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001\u201309), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001\u201309)[250] and Special Committee on Aging.[252] She was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe[253] (2001\u201309).[254] Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York's senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21\u00a0billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment.[255] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[256] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties.[257] In March 2006 she voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 that had gained large majority support.[258] Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[259] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[260] After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[261] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000\u00a0soldiers to ease the strain.[262] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay \"until the job is done\" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis \"an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves\".[263] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[264] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[265][266] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[266] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying she \"got it wrong\" and the vote in support had been a \"mistake\".[267]) Clinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[268] Simon & Schuster released Living History:[247] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[269] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[270] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[271] Clinton's audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[272] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as chief justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[273][274] In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[275] Along with senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[268][276] Looking to establish a \"progressive infrastructure\" to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration chief of staff John Podesta's Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons' former antagonist David Brock's Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[277] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[278] In November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term. She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[279] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[280] Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former Mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67\u00a0percent of the vote to Spencer's 31\u00a0percent,[281] carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties.[282] Her campaign spent $36\u00a0million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[283] In the following months, she transferred $10\u00a0million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[284] Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging the surge had been successful).[h] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[286] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80\u201314 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[287] She responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, \"I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.\"[288] In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[289] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[290] As the financial crisis of 2007\u201308 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700\u00a0billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74\u201325.[291] In 2007, Clinton and Virginia senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[292] Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. president since at least early 2003.[293] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: \"I'm in and I'm in to win.\"[294] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency, and no first lady had ever run for president. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed the couple's worth was now upwards of $50\u00a0million.[295] They had earned over $100\u00a0million since 2000\u2014most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities.[296] Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[260] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[260] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[297] At the end of October, Clinton fared poorly in her debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[298][299] Obama's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton's message of experience.[300] In the first vote of 2008, she placed third in the January\u00a03 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards.[301] Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary.[302] Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, narrowly defeating Obama.[303] It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.[304] Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.[305] The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[306] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[i] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[307] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[306][308] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[308] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February\u00a05 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign, and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former president \"needs to stop\".[309] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[310] On Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[311] they almost evenly split the total popular vote.[312] But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[313] The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[300][314] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff, and she made several top-level personnel changes.[314][315] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[313][314] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[314] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[316] Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored and failed to prepare.[300][313] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[317][318] Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[319] Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.[320] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[321] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640\u00a0pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763;[322] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama's 395,[323] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[322] Clinton and Obama each received over 17\u00a0million votes during the nomination process[j] with both breaking the previous record.[324] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[304] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[325] Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13\u00a0million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[326] In mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration.[327] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position.[328][329] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state.[330][331] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \"difficult and exciting adventure\".[331] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.[332] The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[333] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the committee voted 16\u20131 to approve Clinton.[334] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65\u00a0percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[335] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94\u20132.[336] Clinton took the oath of office of secretary of state, resigning from the Senate later that day.[337] She became the first former first lady to be a member of the United States Cabinet.[338] Clinton spent her initial days as secretary of state telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: \"We have a lot of damage to repair.\"[339] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department, and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.[340] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.[341] The first such review was issued in late 2010. It called for the U.S. leading through \"civilian power\" as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises.[342] It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world.[188] A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.[328] In a 2009 internal debate regarding the War in Afghanistan, Clinton sided with the military's recommendations for a maximal \"Afghanistan surge\", recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal. She prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's opposition but eventually supported Obama's compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[266][343] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a \"reset button\" symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[344][345] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office.[344] Relations would worsen considerably, however, following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012.[346] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish\u2013Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[347][348] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[186][k] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[328][350][351] Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[352][353] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[354] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[328] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[353] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[355][356] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[328] In a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet.[357] Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it. The speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.[358] In July 2010, she visited South Korea, where she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the Caracol Industrial Park would have a key tenant.[359] This was part of the \"build back better\" program initiated by her husband, named UN Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 after a tropical storm season caused $1 billion in damages to the island.[360] In January 2011, Clinton traveled to Haiti in order to help pave the way for the election of Michel Martelly.[361] The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis yet for the Obama administration.[362] Clinton's public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was \"stable\", to a stance that there needed to be an \"orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government\", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[363][364] Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[362] As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[365] As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power This was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[365][366][367] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. The State Department's legal advisor argued the same point when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[368] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called \"convening power\" to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[366] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state.[369] The wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[370][371][372] During April 2011, internal deliberations of the president's innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[373][374] Following the completion of the mission on May\u00a02 resulting in bin Laden's death, Clinton played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[375] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000\u201320,000 U.S. troops there. (All of them ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.\u2013Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed.)[266][376] In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that, \"Gay rights are human rights\", and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.[377] The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955. She met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.[378][379] She also said the 21st century would be \"America's Pacific century\",[380] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's \"pivot to Asia\".[381] During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform. As government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, they called for him to resign from the presidency.[382] The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria.[383] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels. The proposal was rejected by White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict, fearing that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.[378][384] In December 2012, Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus.[385] Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[385][386] The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication, and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.[386][387][l] Throughout her time in office (and mentioned in her final speech concluding it), Clinton viewed \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values. In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[366][392] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[393] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[266][354][376] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[394] Clinton greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-\u00e0-vis their governments.[366] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[188] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the \"Hillary Doctrine\", she viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state, and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[352][395] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[396] Clinton visited 112\u00a0countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[397][m] (Time magazine wrote that \"Clinton's endurance is legendary\".)[366] The first secretary of state to visit countries like Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[400] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[367] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor.[386] Her last day as secretary of state was February 1, 2013.[401] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had accomplished,[355][356] and highlighted her focus on goals she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[402] She has also been criticized for accepting millions in dollars in donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State.[403] On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[404] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[404][405] On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[406] It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[407] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[406] Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident, and while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[408] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate \"talking points\" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.\"[408][409] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration's response to the attack.[410] The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[411] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[411][412] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation.[411][413] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[414][415] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[414] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[416] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines.[411] The Republican report offered some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[412] A controversy arose in March 2015, when the State Department's inspector general revealed that Clinton had used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server exclusively\u2014instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers\u2014when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements.[417] The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[418][419] In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and \"never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system\". They also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[420] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[421] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called \"born classified\" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[422] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[423] Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails \"contained classified State Department information when originated\".[424] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[425] Clinton maintained she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, \"I never sent or received any classified material\u2014they are retroactively classifying it.\" On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: \"Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.\"[426][427] On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said: 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were \"up-classified\" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[423][428]Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small \"c\" in parentheses, described as \"portion markings\" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not \"technically sophisticated\" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[428] The probe found Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Comey acknowledged that it was \"possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account\". He added that \"[although] we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\". Nevertheless, Comey asserted that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would bring criminal charges in this case, despite the existence of \"potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information\". The FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute.[423] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2014who had met privately with Bill Clinton on June 27[429][430]\u2014confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers would be closed without criminal charges.[431] On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had begun looking into newly discovered Clinton emails. Law enforcement officials said that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered emails related to Clinton's private server on a laptop computer belonging to Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed the conclusion it had reached in July.[432] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[433] The emails controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election.[434][435][436] In September 2019, the State Department finished its internal review into 33,000 emails that Clinton had turned over. The investigation that began in 2016 found 588 violations of security procedures and found that Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information. In 91 cases, the culpability of sending classified information could be attributed to 38 people, but the review concluded there was \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\".[437][438] When Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years.[439] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[440] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600\u00a0million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[440][441] In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as secretary of state. As of July\u00a02015[update], the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[442] Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[443] its March 2015 report said that while \"There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman\u00a0... this data shows just how far we still have to go.\"[444] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary of state.[n] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[447] She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[448] There she received $200,000\u2013225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[448][449] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[448] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11\u00a0million from her speeches.[450] For the overall period 2007\u201314, the Clintons earned almost $141\u00a0million, paid some $56\u00a0million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15\u00a0million to charity.[451] As of 2015[update], she was estimated to be worth over $30\u00a0million on her own, or $45\u201353\u00a0million with her husband.[452] Clinton resigned from the board of the foundation in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign. The foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[n] On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[453] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[454] The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[455] Her campaign focused on: raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool, making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[456][457] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[453] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.[449][457] In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders\u2014[458][459] the first woman to win them.[458] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[460] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[461] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[462] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[461] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[461] On March 1 Super Tuesday, Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters. She opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[463] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout. Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents. Clinton did better among older, black and Hispanic voter populations, and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[464][465][466] By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[467] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn becoming the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[468] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47.[469] She received almost 17\u00a0million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13\u00a0million.[470] Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[471] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[472] Her opponents in the general election included Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Around the time of the convention, WikiLeaks released emails that suggested the DNC and the Clinton campaign tilted the primary in Clinton's favor. Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton were tied in major polls following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[473][474] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified government material.[475] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a three to four percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention. This was in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the low side by historical standards.[476][477][478] Following Clinton's seven percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[479][480] In fall 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States.[481] Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016, presidential election.[482] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win; media sources proclaimed him the winner.[483] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave his victory speech.[484] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying: \"We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.\"[485] Though Clinton lost the election by capturing only 232 electoral votes to Trump's 306, she won the popular vote by more than 2.8\u00a0million votes, or 2.1% of the voter base.[486][487] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[o][488][489] She won the most votes of any candidate who did not take office and the third-most votes of any candidate in history,[490][491] though she did not have the greatest percentage win of a losing candidate. (Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by 10.4% but lost to John Quincy Adams).[492] On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes being cast instead for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle, and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[493] In their respective capacities as a former president and a former first lady, Bill and Hillary Clinton attended the inauguration of Donald Trump with their daughter, Chelsea. The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, \"I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country & its future.\"[494] Clinton delivered a St. Patrick's Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 17, 2017, referring to reports of her being seen taking walks in the woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election.[495][496] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from \"the woods\" and become politically active again.[495] On March 24, 2017, after the postponement of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day \"a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance\" and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[497] She went on to call the American Health Care Act \"a disastrous bill\" during a San Francisco speech four days later.[498] After the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act on May 4, Clinton dubbed it a \"shameful failure of policy & morality by GOP\".[499] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, \"This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill.\"[500] Clinton commented that she would not seek public office again in April.[501] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the U.S. should take out Bashar al-Assad's airfields and thereby \"prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them\".[502] In May 2017 Clinton announced the formation of Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote is \"dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election\".[503] In a June 2017 appearance at a Baltimore fundraiser for the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel (ECYP), Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: \"When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program's mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.\"[504] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, \"2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we're all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff & heroic police.\"[505] Clinton's third memoir, What Happened, an account of her devastating loss in the 2016 election, was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon & Schuster, in print, e-book, and as an audiobook read by the author.[506] A book tour and a series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[507] What Happened sold 300,000 copies in its first week,[508][509] less than her 2003 memoir, Living History, but triple the first-week sales of her previous memoir, 2014's Hard Choices.[508][510] Simon & Schuster announced that What Happened had sold more e-books in its first-week than any nonfiction e-book since 2010.[508] As of December 10, 2017, the book had sold 448,947 hardcover copies.[511] An announcement was made in February 2017 that efforts were under way to render her 1996 book It Takes a Village as a picture book.[512] Marla Frazee, a two-time winner of the Caldecott Medal, was announced as the illustrator.[512] Clinton had worked on it with Frazee during her 2016 presidential election campaign.[513] The result was published on the same day of publication as What Happened.[514][513] The book is aimed at preschool-aged children, although a few messages are more likely better understood by adults.[513] In October 2018, Hillary and Bill Clinton announced plans for a 13-city speaking tour in various cities in the United States and Canada between November 2018 and May 2019.[515] Hillary was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in law (LLD) at Queen's University Belfast on October 10, 2018, after giving a speech on Northern Ireland and the impacts of Brexit at Whitla Hall, Belfast.[516] In June 2018, Trinity College Dublin awarded her with an honorary doctorate (LLD).[517] A package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to Clinton's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. It was intercepted by the Secret Service. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders and to CNN.[518][519] On March 4, 2019, Clinton announced that she would not run for president in 2020.[520] In October 2019, Trump tweeted that Clinton should run for a third time, prompting her response of \"don't tempt me\".[521] On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indian men by Adam Purinton.[522] On May 2, Clinton said Trump's use of Twitter \"doesn't work\" when pursuing important negotiations. \"Kim Jong Un\u00a0... [is] always interested in trying to get Americans to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position\". Negotiations with North Korea should not take place without \"a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.\"[523] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump's 2018 budget proposal was \"a con\" for underfunding domestic programs.[524] On June 1, when President Trump announced withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a \"historic mistake\".[525] On September 29, 2019, in an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Clinton described Trump as a \"threat\" to the country's standing in the world, an \"illegitimate president\", despite having won the election, and a \"corrupt human tornado\".[526] On January 2, 2020, it was announced that Hillary Clinton would take up the position of Chancellor at Queen's University Belfast after her husband had previously played a role in the Northern Ireland peace process and the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Clinton became the 11th and first female chancellor of the university, filling the position that had been vacant since 2018 after the death of her predecessor, Thomas J. Moran. Commenting on taking up the position, she said that \u201cthe university is making waves internationally for its research and impact and I am proud to be an ambassador and help grow its reputation for excellence\". Queen's Pro-Chancellor Stephen Prenter said that Clinton on her appointment \"will be an incredible advocate for Queen's\" who can act as an \"inspirational role model\".[527][528] Using her Senate votes, several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically. National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 on the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of\u00a01 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[529] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[530] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her likely to be the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[531] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75\u00a0liberal, 23\u00a0conservative; Social = 83\u00a0liberal, 6\u00a0conservative; Foreign = 66\u00a0liberal, 30\u00a0conservative. Total average = 75\u00a0liberal, 20\u00a0conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, \"Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.\"[532] Organizations have also attempted to provide more recent assessments of Clinton after she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in the \"Left Liberal\" region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances, with an economic score of ten on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[533] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[534] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90\u00a0percent \"Liberal Quotient\" from Americans for Democratic Action,[535] and a lifetime eight\u00a0percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[536] In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called \"optimistic\" and \"wide-ranging\". Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \"clawback\" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[537] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as \"the gold standard\"[538] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that \"any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security\".[539][540] As senator (2001\u20132009), her record on trade was mixed; she voted in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[539] Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit \"unaccountable money\" in politics.[541] In July 2016, she \"committed\" to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[542][543] On December 7, 2015, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities in the New York Times.[544] Accepting the scientific consensus on climate change, Clinton supports cap-and-trade,[545] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline.[546] She supported \"equal pay for equal work\", to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[547] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.[541] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a \"fair share surcharge\".[548] Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act[549] and would have added a \"public option\" that competed with private insurers and enabled people \"50 or 55 and up\" to buy into Medicare.[550][551] On LGBT rights, she supported the right to same-sex marriage.[541] In 2013, Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage; in 2000, she was against such marriages altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages.[552] In 2000, she was the first spouse of a US president to march in an LGBT pride parade.[553] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).[554] Clinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship \"[i]s at its heart a family issue\",[555] and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.[556][557] However, in 2014, Clinton stated that unaccompanied children crossing the border \"should be sent back.\"[558] She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[559] Expressing support for Common Core[560] she said, \"The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized\u00a0... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that and so don't understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.\"[561] On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002,[562] a vote she later \"regretted\".[563] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[564] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[565][566] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[559] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \"America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival.\"[567] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[568][569] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[570] In 2000, Clinton advocated for the elimination of the electoral college.[571] She promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it, resulting in the direct election of the president.[572][573] Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church: Clinton discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[574] However, she has seldom discussed her faith while campaigning.[575][576] She has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and \"creating opportunities for others to be lifted up\".[576] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that \"Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.\"[576] Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley: \"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.\"[575] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy \"made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith\".[577] Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found \"a virtual cottage industry\" of \"anti-Clinton literature\" put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints. Some titles include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless\u00a0... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[578] (other than her memoirs and those of her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[579] Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable \"bogeyman\" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[580] Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture in a wide spectrum of perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[581] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, \"Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.\"[582] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as the first lady. She has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelg\u00e4ngers.[583][584] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her including \"The Hillary Shimmy Song\", which went viral.[585][586][587][588] She has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, though some argue otherwise.[589] In the early stages of her 2008 presidential campaign, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her with two checkboxes labeled \"Love Her\", \"Hate Her\".[590] Mother Jones titled its profile of her \"Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary\".[591] Following Clinton's \"choked up moment\" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[592][593] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed up the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying the New Hampshire events, \"brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades\u00a0... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics\".[593] Once she became secretary of state, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[352][594] Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[595] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[596] During 2016 she acknowledged that: \"I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed.\"[597] *\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.",

She served as First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, as a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and as the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to Donald Trump.\nRaised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992.\nAs First Lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the Clinton health care plan\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.\nIn 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York. She was re-elected in 2006. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was damaged in the September 11 attacks.[3] In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries.\nClinton was U.S. secretary of state in the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya. She was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Her use of a private e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the e-mail controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election. Upon leaving her Cabinet position after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.\nClinton made a second presidential run in 2016. After winning the Democratic nomination, she ran in the general election with Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. Clinton lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the Electoral College despite winning a plurality of the popular vote. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups.\nHillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois.[4][5] She was raised in a United Methodist family who first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[6] Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent,[7] and managed a small but successful textile business, which he had founded.[8] Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[7][9][10] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[11]\nAs a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools she attended in Park Ridge.[12] She participated in swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[12] She has often told the story[13][14][15] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[16] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council and school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[4][17] She was elected class vice president for her junior year but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that \"you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president\".[18] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then-new Maine South High School. There she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted \"most likely to succeed.\" She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class.[19]\nRodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career.[10] Her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[20] She was raised in a politically conservative household,[10] and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon,[21] and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[22]\nRodham's early political development was shaped mostly by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[23]\nIn 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[24][25] During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[26][27] As the leader of this \"Rockefeller Republican\"-oriented group,[28] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[29] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[26] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as \"a mind conservative and a heart liberal\".[30] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[31][32]\nBy her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[33] In early 1968 she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association, a position she held until early 1969.[31][34] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[33] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[31][35] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female president of the United States.[31]\nTo help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the \"Wellesley in Washington\" summer program.[33] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[33] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's \"veiled\" racist messages, and she left the Republican Party for good.[33]\nRodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[36] (Years later, while she was the first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[36])\nIn 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[37] with departmental honors in political science.[36] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of the commencement speaker, Senator Edward Brooke.[34][38] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[31][39][40] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[41][42] because of the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[38] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[43] She was asked to speak at the 50th anniversary convention of the League of Women Voters in Washington, D.C., the next year.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).[45]\nRodham then entered Yale Law School, where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital,[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey. Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]\nIn the spring of 1971, she began dating fellow law student Bill Clinton. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans and moved to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[37] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation, but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]\nRodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, \"Children Under the Law\", was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children's rights movement, the article stated that \"child citizens\" were \"powerless individuals\"[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence on a case-by-case basis, except when there is evidence otherwise.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]\nDuring her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for it.[67] The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]\nBy then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.[68] Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him, but she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, \"I chose to follow my heart instead of my head\".[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]\nAt the university, Rodham taught classes in criminal law. She was considered a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] Rodham became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] As a court-appointed lawyer, Rodham was required to act as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl; after her request to be relieved of the assignment failed, Rodham used an effective defense and counseled her client to plead guilty to a lesser charge. She has called the trial a \"terrible case\".[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about getting married; she was concerned that her separate identity would be lost, and that her accomplishments would be viewed in light of someone else.[78]\nIn 1974, Bill Clinton lost an Arkansas congressional race, facing incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt.[79] Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she agreed to marry him.[80] The wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[81] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she decided to retain the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] Her motivation was threefold. She wanted to keep the couple's professional lives separate, avoid apparent conflicts of interest, and as she told a friend at the time, \"it showed that I was still me\".[83] The decision upset both mothers, who were more traditional.[84]\nIn 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[85][86] In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[79] In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[87] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while working pro bono in child advocacy;[88] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[89]\nRodham maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles \"Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect\" in 1977[90] and \"Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective\" in 1979.[91] The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, \"Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.\"[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as \"one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades\".[92] Conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[93] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[94]\nIn 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[46][96] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[97] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation.[98] She held that position from 1978 until the end of 1981.[99] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to hold the job.[100] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90\u00a0million to $300\u00a0million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[88]\nFollowing her husband's November 1978 election as governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's first lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979\u201381, 1983\u201392). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[101] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.[102]\nIn 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner in Rose Law Firm.[103] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[104] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[105] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[106] At this time, the couple began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[105] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.\nOn February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[107]\nTwo years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to his job as governor of Arkansas after he won the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name \"Hillary Clinton\", or sometimes \"Mrs. Bill Clinton\", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[108] During her second stint as the first lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system.[114][115] In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[101][114] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][114] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[116] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[117][118]\nClinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was the first lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours[119] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[120] The firm considered her a \"rainmaker\" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[120] Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[121]\nFrom 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[122] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[123] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[124] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America\u2014in 1988 and in 1991.[125] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running. Private polls were unfavorable, however, and in the end he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[126]\nClinton was chairman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund[4][127] and on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Legal Services (1988\u201392)[128] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985\u201392),[129] Wal-Mart Stores (1986\u201392)[130] and Lafarge (1990\u201392).[131] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[120][132] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[132] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices.[130][132][133] According to Dan Kaufman, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump.[134][135]\nClinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[136] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged \"causing pain in my marriage\".[137] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[138] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song \"Stand by Your Man\".[d] Later in the campaign, she commented she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers. In retrospect she admitted they were ill-considered. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would \"get two for the price of one\", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[144] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[93] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[145]\nWhen Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady. Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[146] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][147] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration. Her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[148] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[149][150]\nSome critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors, and that voters had been well aware she would play an active role in her husband's presidency.[151] Bill Clinton's campaign promise of \"two for the price of one\" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as \"co-presidents\" or sometimes use the Arkansas label \"Billary\".[101][152][153] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into \"imaginary discussions\" with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[157][158] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's \"politics of meaning\" to overcome what she saw as America's \"sleeping sickness of the soul\"; that would lead to a willingness \"to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium\".[159][160]\nIn January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[161] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[162][163] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as \"Hillarycare\" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress.[164] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[164]\nFailing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[165] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors. The first lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50 percent range during her first year, fell to 44\u00a0percent in April 1994 and 35\u00a0percent by September 1994.[166]\nRepublicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[167] They saw a net gain of 54 seats in the House election and eight in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.[168] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.[169] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use \"Hillarycare\" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[170]\nAlong with senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. This federal bill gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage. She conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[171] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[172] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. She worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]\nEnactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency. When the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress lacking protections for people coming off welfare, however, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[173][174] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[173] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[173][174] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called \"sad and painful\".[174]\nTogether with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60]\nIn 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as the first lady.[60][175] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[175]\nAs First Lady of the United States, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences. These included one on Child Care (1997),[176] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[177] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[178] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000),[179] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[180]\nClinton traveled to 79\u00a0countries during this time,[181] breaking the record for most-traveled first lady previously held by Pat Nixon.[182] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[183] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department, without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[184] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited, and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[185] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[186]\nIn a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People's Republic of China itself. She declared, \"it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights\".[187] Delegates from over 180\u00a0countries heard her say: \"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all.\"[188] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[181][188] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases.[189] During the late 1990s, she was one of the most prominent international figures to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[190][191] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[192] It and Clinton's own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[193]\nClinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.\nThe Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from its publication in a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[194] and throughout her time as the first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[195] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed, and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators her husband had appointed.[194] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[196] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[197][198] After a two-year search, the records were found in the first lady's White House book room and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[198] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[198] Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion.[199] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first spouse of a U.S. president to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[197] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[200]\nScrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an action that became known as \"Travelgate\", began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[201] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo led to the investigation being focused on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[202][203] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made \"factually false\" statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[204]\nIn March 1994, newspaper reports revealed that Clinton had earned spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978\u201379.[205] The press made allegations that Clinton had engaged in a conflict of interest and disguised a bribery. Several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[206]\nAn outgrowth of the \"Travelgate\" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called \"Filegate\".[207] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[208] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[207]\nIn early 2001, a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House; there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons' personal property. During the last year of Bill Clinton's time in office, those gifts were shipped to the Clintons' private residence.[209][210]\nIn 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book,[211] although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies.[212][213]\nThe book spent 18\u00a0weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one.[214] By 2000, it had sold 450,000\u00a0copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback.[215]\nClinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording.[216] She was the first president's wife to win a Grammy Award.[217]\nIn 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[218] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\".[219][220] She characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.[222] After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage. Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage.[223] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[224]\nPublic reaction varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions. They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[225] In the wake of the revelations, her public approval ratings shot upward to around 70\u00a0percent, the highest they had ever been.[225] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to \"a love that has persisted for decades\" and add: \"No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.\"[226]\nIssues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills. In 2014, Hillary would say she and Bill had left the White House \"not only dead broke, but in debt\". The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who give paid speeches after leaving office. The couple would also have the ability to secure loans from banks.[227]\nOther books published by Clinton when she was the first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children's book Beatrice's Goat.[228]\nShe was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites.[229] This included the flag that inspired \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She also published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled \"Talking It Over\" from 1995 to 2000.[230][231] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.[4]\nShe was head of the White House Millennium Council[232] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[233] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned by museums.[234]\nIn the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe,[235] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[236] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[237] These included changing of the Treaty Room and a presidential study to have a 19th-century look.[236] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[237] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60]\nWhen New York's long-serving U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[238] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[239] She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[240] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani\u2014the mayor of New York City\u2014as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public. Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.[241]\nBill de Blasio was Clinton's campaign manager. She began her drive to the U.S. Senate by visiting all 62 counties in the state, in a \"listening tour\" of small-group settings.[242] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000\u00a0jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[243]\nThe contest drew national attention. During a September debate, Lazio blundered when he seemed to invade Clinton's personal space by trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[244] Their campaigns, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90\u00a0million.[245] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55\u00a0percent of the vote to Lazio's 43\u00a0percent.[244] She was sworn in as U.S. senator on January 3, 2001.[246]\nPublisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8\u00a0million in December 2000 for her autobiography, released in 2003, as Living History.[247]\nUpon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.[248] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[157][249] She sat on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001\u201302),[250] Committee on Armed Services (2003\u201309),[251] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001\u201309), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001\u201309)[250] and Special Committee on Aging.[252]\nShe was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe[253] (2001\u201309).[254]\nFollowing the September 11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York's senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21\u00a0billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment.[255] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[256] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties.[257] In March 2006 she voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 that had gained large majority support.[258]\nClinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[259] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[260]\nAfter the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[261] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000\u00a0soldiers to ease the strain.[262] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay \"until the job is done\" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis \"an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves\".[263] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[264] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[265][266] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[266] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying she \"got it wrong\" and the vote in support had been a \"mistake\".[267])\nClinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[268] Simon &amp; Schuster released Living History:[247] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[269] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[270] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[271] Clinton's audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[272]\nClinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as chief justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[273][274]\nIn 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[275] Along with senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[268][276]\nLooking to establish a \"progressive infrastructure\" to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration chief of staff John Podesta's Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons' former antagonist David Brock's Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[277] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[278]\nIn November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term. She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[279] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[280] Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former Mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67\u00a0percent of the vote to Spencer's 31\u00a0percent,[281] carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties.[282] Her campaign spent $36\u00a0million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[283] In the following months, she transferred $10\u00a0million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[284]\nClinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging the surge had been successful).[h] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[286] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80\u201314 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[287] She responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, \"I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.\"[288]\nIn March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[289] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[290]\nAs the financial crisis of 2007\u201308 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700\u00a0billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74\u201325.[291]\nIn 2007, Clinton and Virginia senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[292]\nClinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. president since at least early 2003.[293] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: \"I'm in and I'm in to win.\"[294] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency, and no first lady had ever run for president.\nWhen Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed the couple's worth was now upwards of $50\u00a0million.[295] They had earned over $100\u00a0million since 2000\u2014most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities.[296]\nThroughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[260] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[260] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[297]\nAt the end of October, Clinton fared poorly in her debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[298][299] Obama's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton's message of experience.[300]\nIn the first vote of 2008, she placed third in the January\u00a03 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards.[301] Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary.[302] Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, narrowly defeating Obama.[303] It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.[304] Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.[305]\nThe nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[306] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[i] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[307] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[306][308] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[308] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February\u00a05 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign, and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former president \"needs to stop\".[309] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[310]\nOn Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[311] they almost evenly split the total popular vote.[312] But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[313]\nThe Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[300][314] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff, and she made several top-level personnel changes.[314][315] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[313][314] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[314] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[316] Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored and failed to prepare.[300][313] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[317][318] Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[319]\nFollowing the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.[320] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[321] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640\u00a0pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763;[322] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama's 395,[323] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[322] Clinton and Obama each received over 17\u00a0million votes during the nomination process[j] with both breaking the previous record.[324] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[304] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[325] Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13\u00a0million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[326]\nIn mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration.[327] She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position.[328][329] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state.[330][331] Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \"difficult and exciting adventure\".[331] As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.[332]\nThe appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[333] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the committee voted 16\u20131 to approve Clinton.[334] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65\u00a0percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[335] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94\u20132.[336] Clinton took the oath of office of secretary of state, resigning from the Senate later that day.[337] She became the first former first lady to be a member of the United States Cabinet.[338]\nClinton spent her initial days as secretary of state telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: \"We have a lot of damage to repair.\"[339] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department, and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.[340] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.[341] The first such review was issued in late 2010. It called for the U.S. leading through \"civilian power\" as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises.[342] It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world.[188] A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.[328]\nIn a 2009 internal debate regarding the War in Afghanistan, Clinton sided with the military's recommendations for a maximal \"Afghanistan surge\", recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal. She prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's opposition but eventually supported Obama's compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[266][343]\nIn March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a \"reset button\" symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[344][345] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office.[344] Relations would worsen considerably, however, following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012.[346] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish\u2013Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[347][348] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[186][k] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[328][350][351]\nClinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[352][353] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[354] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[328] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[353] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[355][356] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[328]\nIn a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet.[357] Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it. The speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.[358]\nIn July 2010, she visited South Korea, where she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the Caracol Industrial Park would have a key tenant.[359] This was part of the \"build back better\" program initiated by her husband, named UN Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 after a tropical storm season caused $1 billion in damages to the island.[360] In January 2011, Clinton traveled to Haiti in order to help pave the way for the election of Michel Martelly.[361]\nThe 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis yet for the Obama administration.[362] Clinton's public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was \"stable\", to a stance that there needed to be an \"orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government\", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[363][364] Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[362] As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[365]\nAs the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power This was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[365][366][367] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. The State Department's legal advisor argued the same point when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[368] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called \"convening power\" to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[366] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state.[369] The wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[370][371][372]\nDuring April 2011, internal deliberations of the president's innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[373][374] Following the completion of the mission on May\u00a02 resulting in bin Laden's death, Clinton played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[375] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000\u201320,000 U.S. troops there. (All of them ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.\u2013Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed.)[266][376]\nIn a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that, \"Gay rights are human rights\", and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.[377] The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955. She met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.[378][379] She also said the 21st century would be \"America's Pacific century\",[380] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's \"pivot to Asia\".[381]\nDuring the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform. As government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, they called for him to resign from the presidency.[382] The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria.[383] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels. The proposal was rejected by White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict, fearing that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.[378][384]\nIn December 2012, Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus.[385] Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[385][386] The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication, and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.[386][387][l]\nThroughout her time in office (and mentioned in her final speech concluding it), Clinton viewed \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values. In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[366][392] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[393] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[266][354][376] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[394]\nClinton greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-\u00e0-vis their governments.[366]\nAnd in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[188] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the \"Hillary Doctrine\", she viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state, and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[352][395] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[396]\nClinton visited 112\u00a0countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[397][m] (Time magazine wrote that \"Clinton's endurance is legendary\".)[366] The first secretary of state to visit countries like Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[400] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[367] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor.[386] Her last day as secretary of state was February 1, 2013.[401] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had accomplished,[355][356] and highlighted her focus on goals she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[402] She has also been criticized for accepting millions in dollars in donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State.[403]\nOn September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[404] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[404][405]\nOn December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[406] It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[407] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[406]\nClinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident, and while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[408] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate \"talking points\" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.\"[408][409]\nIn November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration's response to the attack.[410]\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[411] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[411][412] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation.[411][413] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[414][415] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[414] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[416] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines.[411] The Republican report offered some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[412]\nA controversy arose in March 2015, when the State Department's inspector general revealed that Clinton had used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server exclusively\u2014instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers\u2014when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements.[417] The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[418][419]\nIn a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and \"never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system\". They also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[420] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[421] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called \"born classified\" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[422] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[423] Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails \"contained classified State Department information when originated\".[424] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[425]\nClinton maintained she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, \"I never sent or received any classified material\u2014they are retroactively classifying it.\" On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: \"Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.\"[426][427]\nOn July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:\n110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were \"up-classified\" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[423][428]Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small \"c\" in parentheses, described as \"portion markings\" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not \"technically sophisticated\" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[428] The probe found Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Comey acknowledged that it was \"possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account\". He added that \"[although] we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\". Nevertheless, Comey asserted that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would bring criminal charges in this case, despite the existence of \"potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information\". The FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute.[423] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2014who had met privately with Bill Clinton on June 27[429][430]\u2014confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers would be closed without criminal charges.[431]\nOn October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had begun looking into newly discovered Clinton emails. Law enforcement officials said that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered emails related to Clinton's private server on a laptop computer belonging to Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed the conclusion it had reached in July.[432] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[433] The emails controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election.[434][435][436]\nIn September 2019, the State Department finished its internal review into 33,000 emails that Clinton had turned over. The investigation that began in 2016 found 588 violations of security procedures and found that Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information. In 91 cases, the culpability of sending classified information could be attributed to 38 people, but the review concluded there was \"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\".[437][438]\nWhen Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years.[439] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[440] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600\u00a0million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[440][441]\nIn 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as secretary of state. As of July\u00a02015[update], the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[442]\nClinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[443] its March 2015 report said that while \"There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman\u00a0... this data shows just how far we still have to go.\"[444] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary of state.[n] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[447]\nShe began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[448] There she received $200,000\u2013225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[448][449] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[448] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11\u00a0million from her speeches.[450] For the overall period 2007\u201314, the Clintons earned almost $141\u00a0million, paid some $56\u00a0million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15\u00a0million to charity.[451] As of 2015[update], she was estimated to be worth over $30\u00a0million on her own, or $45\u201353\u00a0million with her husband.[452]\nClinton resigned from the board of the foundation in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign. The foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[n]\nOn April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[453] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[454] The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[455] Her campaign focused on: raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool, making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[456][457] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[453] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.[449][457]\nIn the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders\u2014[458][459] the first woman to win them.[458] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[460] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[461] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[462] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[461] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[461]\nOn March 1 Super Tuesday, Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters. She opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[463] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout. Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents. Clinton did better among older, black and Hispanic voter populations, and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[464][465][466]\nBy June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[467] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn becoming the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[468] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47.[469] She received almost 17\u00a0million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13\u00a0million.[470]\nClinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[471] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[472] Her opponents in the general election included Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Around the time of the convention, WikiLeaks released emails that suggested the DNC and the Clinton campaign tilted the primary in Clinton's favor.\nClinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton were tied in major polls following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[473][474] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified government material.[475] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a three to four percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention. This was in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the low side by historical standards.[476][477][478] Following Clinton's seven percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[479][480] In fall 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States.[481]\nClinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016, presidential election.[482] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win; media sources proclaimed him the winner.[483] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave his victory speech.[484] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying: \"We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.\"[485] Though Clinton lost the election by capturing only 232 electoral votes to Trump's 306, she won the popular vote by more than 2.8\u00a0million votes, or 2.1% of the voter base.[486][487] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[o][488][489] She won the most votes of any candidate who did not take office and the third-most votes of any candidate in history,[490][491] though she did not have the greatest percentage win of a losing candidate. (Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by 10.4% but lost to John Quincy Adams).[492]\nOn December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes being cast instead for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle, and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[493]\nIn their respective capacities as a former president and a former first lady, Bill and Hillary Clinton attended the inauguration of Donald Trump with their daughter, Chelsea. The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, \"I'm here today to honor our democracy &amp; its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country &amp; its future.\"[494]\nClinton delivered a St. Patrick's Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 17, 2017, referring to reports of her being seen taking walks in the woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election.[495][496] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from \"the woods\" and become politically active again.[495]\nOn March 24, 2017, after the postponement of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day \"a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance\" and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[497] She went on to call the American Health Care Act \"a disastrous bill\" during a San Francisco speech four days later.[498] After the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act on May 4, Clinton dubbed it a \"shameful failure of policy &amp; morality by GOP\".[499] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, \"This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill.\"[500]\nClinton commented that she would not seek public office again in April.[501] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the U.S. should take out Bashar al-Assad's airfields and thereby \"prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them\".[502]\nIn May 2017 Clinton announced the formation of Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote is \"dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election\".[503] In a June 2017 appearance at a Baltimore fundraiser for the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel (ECYP), Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: \"When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program's mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.\"[504] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, \"2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we're all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff &amp; heroic police.\"[505]\nClinton's third memoir, What Happened, an account of her devastating loss in the 2016 election, was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon &amp; Schuster, in print, e-book, and as an audiobook read by the author.[506] A book tour and a series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[507] What Happened sold 300,000 copies in its first week,[508][509] less than her 2003 memoir, Living History, but triple the first-week sales of her previous memoir, 2014's Hard Choices.[508][510] Simon &amp; Schuster announced that What Happened had sold more e-books in its first-week than any nonfiction e-book since 2010.[508] As of December 10, 2017, the book had sold 448,947 hardcover copies.[511]\nAn announcement was made in February 2017 that efforts were under way to render her 1996 book It Takes a Village as a picture book.[512] Marla Frazee, a two-time winner of the Caldecott Medal, was announced as the illustrator.[512] Clinton had worked on it with Frazee during her 2016 presidential election campaign.[513] The result was published on the same day of publication as What Happened.[514][513] The book is aimed at preschool-aged children, although a few messages are more likely better understood by adults.[513]\nIn October 2018, Hillary and Bill Clinton announced plans for a 13-city speaking tour in various cities in the United States and Canada between November 2018 and May 2019.[515] Hillary was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in law (LLD) at Queen's University Belfast on October 10, 2018, after giving a speech on Northern Ireland and the impacts of Brexit at Whitla Hall, Belfast.[516] In June 2018, Trinity College Dublin awarded her with an honorary doctorate (LLD).[517]\nA package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to Clinton's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. It was intercepted by the Secret Service. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders and to CNN.[518][519]\nOn March 4, 2019, Clinton announced that she would not run for president in 2020.[520] In October 2019, Trump tweeted that Clinton should run for a third time, prompting her response of \"don't tempt me\".[521]\nOn February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indian men by Adam Purinton.[522] On May 2, Clinton said Trump's use of Twitter \"doesn't work\" when pursuing important negotiations. \"Kim Jong Un\u00a0... [is] always interested in trying to get Americans to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position\". Negotiations with North Korea should not take place without \"a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.\"[523] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump's 2018 budget proposal was \"a con\" for underfunding domestic programs.[524] On June 1, when President Trump announced withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a \"historic mistake\".[525]\nOn September 29, 2019, in an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Clinton described Trump as a \"threat\" to the country's standing in the world, an \"illegitimate president\", despite having won the election, and a \"corrupt human tornado\".[526]\nOn January 2, 2020, it was announced that Hillary Clinton would take up the position of Chancellor at Queen's University Belfast after her husband had previously played a role in the Northern Ireland peace process and the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Clinton became the 11th and first female chancellor of the university, filling the position that had been vacant since 2018 after the death of her predecessor, Thomas J. Moran. Commenting on taking up the position, she said that \u201cthe university is making waves internationally for its research and impact and I am proud to be an ambassador and help grow its reputation for excellence\". Queen's Pro-Chancellor Stephen Prenter said that Clinton on her appointment \"will be an incredible advocate for Queen's\" who can act as an \"inspirational role model\".[527][528]\nUsing her Senate votes, several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically. National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 on the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of\u00a01 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[529] National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[530]\nA 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her likely to be the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[531]\nThe Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75\u00a0liberal, 23\u00a0conservative; Social = 83\u00a0liberal, 6\u00a0conservative; Foreign = 66\u00a0liberal, 30\u00a0conservative. Total average = 75\u00a0liberal, 20\u00a0conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, \"Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.\"[532]\nOrganizations have also attempted to provide more recent assessments of Clinton after she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in the \"Left Liberal\" region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances, with an economic score of ten on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[533] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[534] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90\u00a0percent \"Liberal Quotient\" from Americans for Democratic Action,[535] and a lifetime eight\u00a0percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[536]\nIn March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called \"optimistic\" and \"wide-ranging\". Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \"clawback\" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[537] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as \"the gold standard\"[538] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that \"any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security\".[539][540] As senator (2001\u20132009), her record on trade was mixed; she voted in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[539]\nGiven the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit \"unaccountable money\" in politics.[541] In July 2016, she \"committed\" to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[542][543] On December 7, 2015, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities in the New York Times.[544]\nAccepting the scientific consensus on climate change, Clinton supports cap-and-trade,[545] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline.[546]\nShe supported \"equal pay for equal work\", to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[547] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.[541] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a \"fair share surcharge\".[548]\nClinton supported the Affordable Care Act[549] and would have added a \"public option\" that competed with private insurers and enabled people \"50 or 55 and up\" to buy into Medicare.[550][551]\nOn LGBT rights, she supported the right to same-sex marriage.[541] In 2013, Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage; in 2000, she was against such marriages altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages.[552] In 2000, she was the first spouse of a US president to march in an LGBT pride parade.[553] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).[554]\nClinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship \"[i]s at its heart a family issue\",[555] and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.[556][557] However, in 2014, Clinton stated that unaccompanied children crossing the border \"should be sent back.\"[558] She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[559]\nExpressing support for Common Core[560] she said, \"The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized\u00a0... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that and so don't understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.\"[561]\nOn foreign affairs, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002,[562] a vote she later \"regretted\".[563] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[564] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[565][566] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[559] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \"America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival.\"[567] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict.[568][569] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[570]\nIn 2000, Clinton advocated for the elimination of the electoral college.[571] She promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it, resulting in the direct election of the president.[572][573]\nClinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:\nClinton discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[574] However, she has seldom discussed her faith while campaigning.[575][576] She has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and \"creating opportunities for others to be lifted up\".[576] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that \"Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.\"[576]\nProfessor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley: \"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.\"[575] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy \"made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith\".[577]\nOver a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found \"a virtual cottage industry\" of \"anti-Clinton literature\" put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints. Some titles include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless\u00a0... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[578] (other than her memoirs and those of her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[579] Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable \"bogeyman\" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[580]\nClinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture in a wide spectrum of perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[581] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, \"Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.\"[582] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as the first lady. She has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelg\u00e4ngers.[583][584] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her including \"The Hillary Shimmy Song\", which went viral.[585][586][587][588]\nShe has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, though some argue otherwise.[589] In the early stages of her 2008 presidential campaign, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her with two checkboxes labeled \"Love Her\", \"Hate Her\".[590] Mother Jones titled its profile of her \"Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary\".[591] Following Clinton's \"choked up moment\" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[592][593] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed up the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying the New Hampshire events, \"brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades\u00a0... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics\".[593]\nOnce she became secretary of state, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[352][594] Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[595] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[596] During 2016 she acknowledged that: \"I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed.\"[597]\n*\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJane Seymour Fonda[1] (born December 21, 1937)[2] is an American actress, political activist, and former fashion model. She is the recipient of various accolades including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, the AFI Life Achievement Award, and the Honorary Golden Lion.[3] Born to actor Henry Fonda and socialite Frances Ford Seymour, Fonda made her acting debut with the 1960 Broadway play There Was a Little Girl, for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and made her screen debut later the same year with the romantic comedy Tall Story. She rose to prominence in the 1960s with such films as Period of Adjustment (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967), and Barbarella (1968). Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress twice in the 1970s for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The China Syndrome (1979), On Golden Pond (1981), and The Morning After (1986). Consecutive hits Fun with Dick and Jane (1977), California Suite (1978), The Electric Horseman (1979), and 9 to 5 (1980) sustained Fonda's box-office drawing power, and she won a Primetime Emmy Award for her performance in the TV film The Dollmaker (1984). In 1982, she released her first exercise video, Jane Fonda's Workout, which became the highest-selling VHS of all time.[4] It would be the first of 22 such videos over the next 13 years, which would collectively sell over 17 million copies. Divorced from her second husband Tom Hayden, she married billionaire media mogul Ted Turner in 1991 and retired from acting, following a row of commercially unsuccessful films concluded by Stanley & Iris (1990). Fonda divorced Turner in 2001 and returned to the screen with the hit Monster-in-Law (2005). Although Georgia Rule (2007) was the star's only other movie during the 2000s, in the early 2010s she fully re-launched her career. Subsequent films have included The Butler (2013), This Is Where I Leave You (2014), Youth (2015), Our Souls at Night (2017), and Book Club (2018). In 2009, she returned to Broadway after a 49-year absence from the stage, in the play 33 Variations which earned her a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, while her major recurring role in the HBO drama series The Newsroom (2012\u201314) earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She also released another five exercise videos between 2009 and 2012. Fonda currently stars as Grace Hanson in the Netflix comedy series Grace and Frankie, which debuted in 2015 and has earned her nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. Fonda was a visible political activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War. She was photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi, during which she gained the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\". During this time, she was effectively blacklisted in Hollywood. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist and environmental activist.[5] In 2005, along with Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, she co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves on the board of the organization. Jane Seymour Fonda was born in New York City[2] on December 21, 1937. Her parents were the Canadian-born socialite Frances Ford Brokaw (n\u00e9e Seymour; 1908\u20131950) and the American actor Henry Fonda (1905\u20131982). According to her father, the surname Fonda came from an Italian ancestor who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s.[6] There, he intermarried, and the family began to use Dutch given names, with Jane's first Fonda ancestor reaching New York in 1650.[7][8][9] Fonda also has English, French, and Scottish ancestry. She was named for the third wife of Henry VIII, Jane Seymour, to whom she is distantly related on her mother's side.[10] Her brother, Peter (1940\u20132019), was also an actor, and her maternal half-sister is Frances de Villers Brokaw (aka \"Pan\"), whose daughter is Pilar Corrias, the owner of the Pilar Corrias Gallery in London.[11] In 1950, when Fonda was 12, her mother died by suicide while undergoing treatment at Craig House psychiatric hospital in Beacon, New York.[12][13] Later that year, Fonda's father married the socialite Susan Blanchard (born 1928), 23 years his junior; this marriage ended in divorce. At 15 Fonda taught dance at Fire Island Pines, New York.[14] Fonda attended Greenwich Academy in Greenwich, Connecticut; the Emma Willard School in Troy, New York; and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York.[15] Before her acting career, she was a model and appeared twice on the cover of Vogue.[16] Fonda became interested in acting as a teenager while appearing with her father in a charity performance of The Country Girl at the Omaha Community Playhouse.[16] After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for six months to study art.[17] Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting changed the course of her life, Fonda saying, \"I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father \u2013 who had to say so \u2013 told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!\"[18] Fonda's stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with Tall Story, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. Frequent collaborator Robert Redford also made his debut in that film. Period of Adjustment and Walk on the Wild Side followed in 1962. The latter, in which she played a prostitute, earned her a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer. In 1963, she appeared in Sunday in New York. Newsday called her \"the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses\".[19] However, she also had detractors \u2013 in the same year, the Harvard Lampoon named her the \"Year's Worst Actress\" for The Chapman Report.[20] Fonda's career breakthrough came with Cat Ballou (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm turned outlaw. This comedy Western received five Oscar nominations, with Lee Marvin winning best actor, and was one of the year's top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to bankable stardom. The following year, she had a starring role in The Chase opposite Robert Redford, in their first film together, and two-time Oscar winner Marlon Brando. The film received some positive reviews, but Fonda's performance was noticed by Variety magazine: \"Jane Fonda, as Redford's wife and the mistress of wealthy oilman James Fox, makes the most of the biggest female role.\"[21] After this came the comedies Any Wednesday (1966), opposite Jason Robards and Dean Jones, and Barefoot in the Park (1967), again co-starring Redford. In 1968, she played the title role in the science fiction spoof Barbarella, which established her status as a sex symbol. In contrast, the tragedy They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969) won her critical acclaim and marked a significant turning point in her career; Variety magazine wrote, \"Fonda, as the unremittingly cynical loser, the tough and bruised babe of the Dust Bowl, gives a dramatic performance that gives the film a personal focus and an emotionally gripping power.\"[22] In addition, renowned film critic Pauline Kael, in her New Yorker review of the film, noted of Fonda: \"[She] has been a charming, witty nudie cutie in recent years and now gets a chance at an archetypal character. Fonda goes all the way with it, as screen actresses rarely do once they become stars. She doesn't try to save some ladylike part of herself, the way even a good actress like Audrey Hepburn does, peeping at us from behind \"vulgar\" roles to assure us she's not really like that. Fonda stands a good chance of personifying American tensions and dominating our movies in the seventies as Bette Davis did in the thirties.\"[23] For her performance, she won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and earned her first Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Fonda was very selective by the end of the decade, turning down lead roles in Rosemary's Baby and Bonnie and Clyde.[citation needed] In the seventies, Fonda enjoyed her most critically acclaimed period as an actress despite some setbacks for her ongoing activism. According to writer and critic Hilton Als, her performances starting with They Shoot Horses, Don't They? \"heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over. Fonda's ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation.[23] Fonda won her first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1971, again playing a prostitute, the gamine Bree Daniels, in Alan J. Pakula's murder mystery Klute. Prior to shooting, Fonda spent time interviewing several prostitutes and madams. Years later, Fonda discovered that \"there was like a marriage, a melding of souls between this character and me, this woman that I didn't think I could play because I didn't think I was call girl material. It didn't matter.\"[24] Upon its release, Klute was both a critical and commercial success, and Fonda's performance earned her widespread recognition. Pauline Kael wrote: \"As an actress, [Fonda] has a special kind of smartness that takes the form of speed; she's always a little ahead of everybody, and this quicker beat \u2013 this quicker responsiveness \u2013 makes her more exciting to watch. This quality works to great advantage in her full-scale, definitive portrait of a call girl in Klute. It's a good, big role for her, and she disappears into Bree, the call girl, so totally that her performance is very pure \u2013 unadorned by \"acting.\" She never stands outside Bree, she gives herself over to the role, and yet she isn't lost in it\u2014she's fully in control, and her means are extraordinarily economical. She has somehow got to a plane of acting at which even the closest closeup never reveals a false thought and, seen on the movie streets a block away, she's Bree, not Jane Fonda, walking toward us. There isn't another young dramatic actress in American films who can touch her\".[25]Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also praised Fonda's performance, even suggesting that the film should have been titled Bree after her character: \"What is it about Jane Fonda that makes her such a fascinating actress to watch? She has a sort of nervous intensity that keeps her so firmly locked into a film character that the character actually seems distracted by things that come up in the movie.\"[26] During the 1971\u20131972 awards season, Fonda dominated the Best Actress category at almost every major awards ceremony; in addition to her Oscar win, she received her first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama, her first National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress and her second New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Between Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977, Fonda did not have a major film success. She appeared in A Doll's House (1973), Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird (1976). In the former, some critics felt Fonda was miscast, but her work as Nora Helmer drew praise, and a review in The New York Times opined, \"Though the Losey film is ferociously flawed, I recommend it for Jane Fonda's performance. Beforehand, it seemed fair to wonder if she could personify someone from the past; her voice, inflections, and ways of moving have always seemed totally contemporary. But once again she proves herself to be one of our finest actresses, and she's at home in the 1870s, a creature of that period as much as of ours.\"[27] From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: \"I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted.\"[28] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. \"The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed.\"[29] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus. \u2014Fred Zinnemanndirector of Julia (1977) In 1972, Fonda starred as a reporter alongside Yves Montand in Tout Va Bien, directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. The two directors then made Letter to Jane, in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda. Through her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film Fun With Dick and Jane is generally considered her \"comeback\" picture. Critical reaction was mixed, but Fonda's comic performance was praised; Vincent Canby of The New York Times remarked, \"I never have trouble remembering that Miss Fonda is a fine dramatic actress but I'm surprised all over again every time I see her do comedy with the mixture of comic intelligence and abandon she shows here.\"[31] Also in 1977, she portrayed the playwright Lillian Hellman in Julia, receiving positive reviews from critics. Gary Arnold of the Washington Post described her performance as \"edgy, persuasive and intriguingly tensed-up,\" commenting further, \"Irritable, intent and agonizingly self-conscious, Fonda suggests the internal conflicts gnawing at a talented woman who craves the self-assurance, resolve and wisdom she sees in figures like Julia and Hammett.\"[32] For her performance, Fonda won her first BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, and received her third Best Actress Oscar nomination.[33] During this period, Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down An Unmarried Woman because she felt the part was not relevant. In 1978, Fonda was at a career peak after she won her second Best Actress Oscar for her role as Sally Hyde, a conflicted adulteress in Coming Home, the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran's difficulty in re-entering civilian life.[33] Upon its release, the film was a popular success with audiences, and generally received good reviews; Ebert noted that her Sally Hyde was \"the kind of character you somehow wouldn't expect the outspoken, intelligent Fonda to play,\" and Jonathan Rosenbaum of the San Diego Reader felt that Fonda was \"a marvel to watch; what fascinates and involves me in her performance are the conscientious effort and thought that seem to go into every line reading and gesture, as if the question of what a captain's wife and former cheerleader was like became a source of endless curiosity and discovery for her.\"[34] Her performance also earned her a third Golden Globe Award for Best Actress as well, making this her second consecutive win. Also in 1978, she reunited with Alan J. Pakula to star in his post-modern Western drama Comes a Horseman as a hard-bitten rancher, and later took on a supporting role in California Suite, where she played a Manhattan workaholic and divorcee. Variety noted that she \"demonstrates yet another aspect of her amazing range\"[35] and Time Out New York remarked that she gave \"another performance of unnerving sureness.\"[36] She won her second BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with The China Syndrome, about a cover-up of a vulnerability in a nuclear power plant. Cast alongside Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas, in one of his early roles, Fonda played a clever, ambitious television news reporter. Vincent Canby, writing for the New York Times, singled out Fonda's performance for praise: \"The three stars are splendid, but maybe Miss Fonda is just a bit more than that. Her performance is not that of an actress in a star's role, but that of an actress creating a character that happens to be major within the film. She keeps getting better and better.\"[37] This role also earned her Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. The same year, she starred in the western adventure-romance film The Electric Horseman with her frequent co-star, Robert Redford. Although the film received mixed reviews, The Electric Horseman was a box office success, becoming the eleventh highest-grossing film of 1979[38] after grossing a domestic total of nearly $62 million.[39] In 1980, Fonda starred in 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year.[40] Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship.[33] She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her.[41] The father-daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real-life relationship between the two Fondas; they eventually became the first father-daughter duo to earn Oscar nominations (Jane earned her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination) for their roles in the same film. On Golden Pond, which also starred four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.[33] Fonda continued to appear in feature films throughout the 1980s, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for The Dollmaker (1984), and starring in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in Agnes of God (1985). The following year, she played an alcoholic actress and murder suspect in the 1986 thriller The Morning After, opposite Jeff Bridges. In preparation for her role, Fonda modelled the character on the starlet Gail Russell, who, at 36, was found dead in her apartment, among empty liquor bottles. Writing for The New Yorker, Pauline Kael commended Fonda for giving \"a raucous-voiced, down-in-the-dirty performance that has some of the charge of her Bree in Klute, back in 1971.\"[42] For her performance, she was nominated for yet another Academy Award for Best Actress. She ended the decade by appearing in Old Gringo. This was followed by the romantic drama Stanley & Iris (1990) with Robert De Niro, which was her final film for 15 years. Both films did not fare well at the box office, and despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, Fonda's performance as the widowed Iris in the latter was praised by Vincent Canby, who stated, \"Fonda's increasingly rich resources as an actress are evident in abundance here. They even overcome one's awareness that just beneath Iris's frumpy clothes, there is a firm, perfectly molded body that has become a multi-million-dollar industry.\"[43] For many years Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after fracturing her foot while filming The China Syndrome, she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The Leni Workout became the Jane Fonda Workout, which began a second career for her, continuing for many years.[33] This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled Jane Fonda's Workout, inspired by her best-selling book, Jane Fonda's Workout Book. Jane Fonda's Workout became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series.[33] She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.[44] In 1991, after three decades in film, Fonda announced her retirement from the film industry.[45] In May 2005, she returned to the screen with the box office success Monster-in-Law, starring opposite Jennifer Lopez.[33] Two years later, Fonda starred in the Garry Marshall-directed drama Georgia Rule alongside Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan. Georgia Rule was panned by critics, but A. O. Scott of The New York Times felt the film belonged to Fonda and co-star Lohan, before writing, \"Ms. Fonda's straight back and piercing eyes, the righteous jaw line she inherited from her father and a reputation for humorlessness all serve her well here, but it is her warmth and comic timing that make Georgia more than a provincial scold.\"[46] In 2009, Fonda returned to Broadway for the first time since 1963, playing Katherine Brandt in Mois\u00e9s Kaufman's 33 Variations.[47][48] In a mixed review, Ben Brantley of the New York Times praised Fonda's \"layered crispness\" and her \"aura of beleaguered briskness that flirts poignantly with the ghost of her spiky, confrontational screen presence as a young woman. For those who grew up enthralled with Ms. Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\"[49] The role earned her a Tony nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.[50] Fonda filmed her second movie in French when she had a leading role in the 2011 drama All Together.[51][52][53] The same year she starred alongside Catherine Keener in Peace, Love and Misunderstanding, playing a hippie grandmother.[54] In 2012, Fonda began a recurring role as Leona Lansing, CEO of a major media company, in HBO's original political drama The Newsroom. Her role continued throughout the show's three seasons, and Fonda received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. In 2013, Fonda had a small role in The Butler, portraying First Lady Nancy Reagan. She had more film work the following year, appearing in the comedies Better Living Through Chemistry and This is Where I Leave You. She also voiced a character on The Simpsons.[55] She played an acting diva in Paolo Sorrentino's Youth in 2015, for which she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination. She also appeared in Fathers and Daughters (2015) with Russell Crowe. Fonda appears as the co-lead in the Netflix series Grace and Frankie. She and Lily Tomlin play aging women whose husbands reveal they are in love. Filming on the first season was completed in November 2014,[56] and the show premiered online on May 8, 2015. In 2016, Fonda voiced Shuriki in Elena and the Secret of Avalor. In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Fonda and others told the stories of the people killed there.[57][58] Fonda starred in her fourth collaboration with Robert Redford in the 2017 romantic drama film Our Souls at Night. The film and Fonda's performance received critical acclaim upon release. In 2018, she starred opposite Diane Keaton, Mary Steenburgen, and Candice Bergen in the romantic comedy film Book Club. Although opened to mixed reviews, the film was a major box office success grossing $93.4 million against a $10 million budget, despite releasing the same day as Deadpool 2. Fonda is the subject of an HBO original documentary entitled Jane Fonda in Five Acts, directed by the documentarian Susan Lacy. Receiving rave reviews, it covers Fonda's life from childhood through her acting career and political activism and then to the present day.[59] It premiered on HBO on September 24, 2018.[60] During the 1960s, Fonda engaged in political activism in support of the Civil Rights Movement, and in opposition to the Vietnam War.[33] Fonda's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as \"small-c communism\".[61] Along with other celebrities, she supported the Alcatraz Island occupation by American Indians in 1969, which was intended to call attention to the failures of the government with regards to treaty rights and the movement for greater Indian sovereignty.[62] She supported Huey Newton and the Black Panthers in the early 1970s, stating: \"Revolution is an act of love; we are the children of revolution, born to be rebels. It runs in our blood.\" She called the Black Panthers \"our revolutionary vanguard ... we must support them with love, money, propaganda and risk.\"[63] She has been involved in the feminist movement since the 1970s and dovetails her activism in support of civil rights. In April 1970, Fonda, with Fred Gardner and Donald Sutherland formed the FTA tour (\"Free The Army\", a play on the troop expression \"Fuck The Army\"), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to Bob Hope's USO tour. The tour, described as \"political vaudeville\" by Fonda, visited military towns along the West Coast, aiming to establish a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (F.T.A.) which contained strong, frank criticism of the war by servicemen and servicewomen; it was released in 1972.[64] On May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, to speak on GI rights and issues. The end of her presentation was met with a discomforting silence. The quiet was broken when Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage. Drunk, Corso challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: why hadn't she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? Fonda in her autobiography revisited the incident: \"I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool.\" On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president Ferrel Heady. The protesters called themselves \"They Shoot Students, Don't They?\" \u2013 a reference to Fonda's recently released film, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, which had just been screened in Albuquerque.[17] In the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW and was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator.[65] On November 3, 1970, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by The New York Times, Fonda was a \"major patron\" of the VVAW.[66] Between 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans \u2013 mostly civil rights activists, teachers and pastors \u2013 traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war situation with the Vietnamese. News media in the United States predominantly provided a U.S. viewpoint, and American travelers to Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return to the States.[67] Fonda also visited Vietnam, traveling to Hanoi in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes. After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River. Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S. Air Force were \"truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way\".[68] Sweden's ambassador to Vietnam, however, observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as \"methodic\". Other journalists reported that the attacks were \"aimed at the whole system of dikes\".[67] Fonda was photographed seated on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun; the photo outraged a number of Americans,[69] and earned her the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\".[70] In her 2005 autobiography, she wrote that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery; she had been horrified at the implications of the pictures. In a 2011 entry at her official website, Fonda explained: It happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit\u00a0... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return\u00a0... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me\u00a0... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed\u00a0... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen\u00a0... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever\u00a0... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.[71]Fonda made radio broadcasts on Hanoi Radio throughout her two-week tour, describing her visits to villages, hospitals, schools, and factories that had been bombed, and denouncing U.S. military policy.[72][73] During the course of her visit, Fonda visited American prisoners of war (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda said that those making such claims were \"hypocrites and liars and pawns\", adding about the prisoners she visited, \"These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed.\"[74] In addition, Fonda told The New York Times in 1973, \"I'm quite sure that there were incidents of torture\u00a0... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie.\"[75] Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent and exaggerated rumors which were repeated widely, and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later. Fonda, as well as the named POWs, have denied the rumors,[71] and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these allegations to be false\u2014the persons named had never met Fonda.[73] In 1972, Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign, which[76] continued to mobilize antiwar activists in the US after the 1973 Paris Peace Agreement, until 1975 when the United States withdrew from Vietnam.[77] Because of her tour of North Vietnam during wartime and the subsequent rumors, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military persists. For example, when a U.S. Naval Academy plebe ritually shouted out \"Goodnight, Jane Fonda!\", the entire company of midshipmen plebes, who had not yet been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam War, replied \"Goodnight, bitch!\"[78][79] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures.[80] In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he \"consider[ed] it a debt of honor\", adding \"she spit in our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did.\" Fonda refused to press charges.[81][82] In a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating: I would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. ... I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.[83]In a 60 Minutes interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a \"betrayal\" of American forces and of the \"country that gave me privilege\". Fonda said, \"The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine.\" She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: \"There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for.\" Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: \"Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war.\"[84] In 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as part of Project MINARET, a program that some NSA officials have described as \"disreputable if not downright illegal\".[85][86] Fonda's communications, as well as those of her husband, Tom Hayden, were intercepted by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Under the UKUSA Agreement, intercepted data on Americans were sent to the U.S. government.[87][88] On November 3, 1970, Fonda was arrested by authorities at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on suspicion of drug trafficking.[89] Her luggage was searched when she re-entered the United States after participating in an anti-war college speaking tour in Canada, and several small baggies containing pills were seized.[90] Although Fonda protested that the pills were harmless vitamins, she was booked by police and then released on bond. Fonda alleged that the arresting officer told her he was acting on direct orders from the Nixon White House.[91] As she wrote in 2009, \"I told them what [the vitamins] were but they said they were getting orders from the White House. I think they hoped this 'scandal' would cause the college speeches to be canceled and ruin my respectability.\"[89] After lab tests confirmed the pills were vitamins, the charges were dropped with little media attention. Fonda's mugshot from the arrest, in which she raises her fist in a sign of solidarity, has since become a widely published image of the actress.[90] It was used as the poster image for the 2018 HBO documentary on Fonda, \"Jane Fonda in Five Acts\", with a giant billboard sporting the image erected in Times Square in September 2018.[92] In 2017, she began selling merchandise with her mugshot image to benefit the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential.[90] In early March 2017, in an interview with Brie Larson, published by People magazine, Fonda stated, \"One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it's not right.\" She said, \"I've been raped, I've been sexually abused as a child and I've been fired because I wouldn't sleep with my boss.\" She said, \"I always thought it was my fault; that I didn't do or say the right thing. I know young girls who've been raped and didn't even know it was rape. They think, 'It must have been because I said 'no' the wrong way.'\" Through her work, Fonda said she wants to help abuse victims \"realize that [rape and abuse] is not our fault\". Fonda said that her difficult past led her to become such a passionate activist for women's rights. The actress is an active supporter of the V-Day movement, which works to stop violence against women and girls. In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health, which aims to help prevent teen pregnancy. She was a victim of the \"disease to please\" in her early life, which plagued many American females of her generation. Fonda revealed in 2014 that her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, was recurrently sexually abused as young as eight, and this may have led to her suicide when Jane was 12.[93][94] Fonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including V-Day, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit The Vagina Monologues, of which she is an honorary chairperson. She was at the first summit in 2002, bringing together founder Eve Ensler, Afghan women oppressed by the Taliban, and a Kenyan activist campaigning to save girls from genital mutilation.[95] In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta to help prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development.[96] On February 16, 2004, Fonda led a march through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, with Sally Field, Eve Ensler and other women, urging Mexico to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials in helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city.[97] In 2004, she also served as a mentor to the first all-transgender cast of The Vagina Monologues.[98] In the days before the September 17, 2006 Swedish elections, Fonda went to Sweden to support the new political party Feministiskt initiativ in their election campaign.[99] In My Life So Far, Fonda stated that she considers patriarchy to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were \"anti-male\". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she \"still loves men\", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.[100] In April 2016, Fonda said that while she was 'glad' that Bernie Sanders was running, she predicted Hillary Clinton would become the first female president, whose win Fonda believed would result in a \"violent backlash\". Fonda went on to say that we need to \"help men understand why they are so threatened \u2013 and change the way we view masculinity.\"[101] Fonda went to Seattle, in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by Bernie Whitebear. The group had occupied part of the grounds of Fort Lawton, which was in the process of being surplussed by the United States Army and turned into a park. The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local urban Indian population, protesting that \"Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs.\"[102] The endeavor succeeded and the Daybreak Star Cultural Center was constructed in the city's Discovery Park.[103] In addition to environmental reasons, Fonda has been a critic of oil pipelines because of their being built without consent on Native American Land. In 2017, Fonda responded to American President Donald Trump's mandate to resume construction of the controversial North Dakota Pipelines by saying that Trump \"does this illegally because he has not gotten consent from the tribes through whose countries this goes\" and pointing out that \"the U.S. has agreed to treaties that require them to get the consent of the people who are affected, the indigenous people who live there.\"[104] In December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp.[105] She was heckled by three members of Women in Green as she arrived to meet with leading Israeli feminists.[106][unreliable source?] In September 2009, she was one of more than 1,500 signatories to a letter protesting the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival's spotlight on Tel Aviv.[107] The protest letter said that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of \"the Israeli propaganda machine\" because it was supported in part by funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from Israel's conflict with the Palestinians.[108][109][110] Other signers included actor Danny Glover, musician David Byrne, journalist John Pilger, and authors Alice Walker, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.[111][112] Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center stated that \"People who support letters like this are people who do not support a two-state solution. By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv, they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the State of Israel.\"[113] Hier continued, saying that \"it is clear that the script [the protesters] are reading from might as well have been written by Hamas.\"[114] Fonda, in The Huffington Post, said she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it \"was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers.\" She continued, writing \"the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens.\"[115] Fonda emphasized that she, \"in no way, support[s] the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people.\"[115] Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to The Huffington Post rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as \"a strong supporter and friend of Israel\".[116] Fonda argued that the military campaign in Iraq will turn people all over the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War.[117] She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.[118] In September 2005, Fonda was scheduled to join British politician and anti-war activist George Galloway at two stops on his U.S. book tour, Madison, Wisconsin and Chicago. She canceled her appearances at the last minute, citing instructions from her doctors to avoid travel following recent hip surgery.[119] On January 27, 2007, Fonda participated in an anti-war rally and march held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., declaring that \"silence is no longer an option\".[120] She spoke at an anti-war rally earlier that day at the Navy Memorial, where members of the organization Free Republic picketed in a counter protest.[121] In the 2004 presidential election, her name was used as a disparaging epithet against John Kerry, a former VVAW leader, who was then the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie called Kerry a \"Jane Fonda Democrat\". Kerry's opponents also circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, though they sat several rows apart.[122] A faked composite photograph, which gave a false impression that the two had shared a speaker's platform, was also circulated.[123] In 2015, Fonda expressed disapproval of President Barack Obama's permitting of Arctic drilling (Petroleum exploration in the Arctic) at the Sundance Film Festival. In July, she marched in a Toronto protest called the \"March for Jobs, Justice, and Climate\", which was organized by dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and environmental activists, including Canadian author Naomi Klein. The march aimed to show businesses and politicians alike that climate change is inherently linked to issues that may seem unrelated.[124] In addition to issues of civil rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau \"talked so beautifully of needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people ... and yet he has betrayed every one of the things he committed to in Paris.\"[125] In October 2019, Fonda was arrested three times in consecutive weeks protesting climate change outside the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. She was arrested with members of the group Oil Change International on October 11,[126][127] with Grace and Frankie co-star Sam Waterston on October 18,[128] and with actor Ted Danson on October 25.[129] On November 1, Fonda was arrested for the fourth consecutive Friday; also arrested were Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette.[130][131] On December 13, Sally Field was arrested.[132] On December 5 Fonda explained her position in a New York Times op-ed.[133] On April 5, 2005, Random House released Fonda's autobiography My Life So Far. The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third \"act\" will be her most significant, partly because of her commitment to the Christian religion, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered.[134] Fonda's autobiography was well received by book critics and noted to be \"as beguiling and as maddening as Jane Fonda herself\" in its Washington Post review, calling her a \"beautiful bundle of contradictions\".[135] The New York Times called the book \"achingly poignant\".[136] In January 2009, Fonda started chronicling her Broadway return in a blog with posts about topics ranging from her Pilates class to fears and excitement about her new play. She uses Twitter and has a Facebook page.[137] In 2011, Fonda published a new book: Prime Time: Love, health, sex, fitness, friendship, spirit \u2013 making the most of all of your life. It offers stories from her own life as well as from the lives of others, giving her perspective on how to better live what she calls \"the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond\".[138] Fonda's charitable works have focused on youth and education, adolescent reproductive health, environment, human services, and the arts. Fonda marketed her highly-successful line of exercise videos and books in order to fund the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a California lobbying organization she founded with her second husband Tom Hayden in 1978.[91] Fonda has established the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential (GCAPP) in the mid 1990s and the Fonda Family Foundation in the late 1990s. In the mid 2000s, Fonda founded the Jane Fonda Foundation in 2004 with one million dollars of her own money as a charitable corporation with herself as president, chair, director and secretary; Fonda contributes 10 hours each week on its behalf.[139][140][141][142] In 2017, she began selling merchandise featuring her 1970 arrest mugshot on her website, the proceeds of which benefit GCAPP.[90] Jane Fonda has been married and divorced three times. She married her first husband, the French film director Roger Vadim, on August 14, 1965 at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas.[143] The couple had a daughter, Vanessa Vadim, born on September 28, 1968 in Paris, France and named after the actress and activist Vanessa Redgrave.[144] On January 19, 1973, three days after obtaining a divorce from Vadim in Santo Domingo,[145] Fonda married activist Tom Hayden in a free-form ceremony at her home in Laurel Canyon.[146] Their son, Troy O'Donovan Garity, was born on July 7, 1973 in Los Angeles and was given his paternal grandmother's maiden name, as the names \"Fonda and Hayden carried too much baggage\". Fonda and Hayden named their son after Nguyen Van Troi.[147] Hayden chose O'Donovan as the middle name after the Irish revolutionary Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa.[148] In 1982, Fonda and Hayden unofficially adopted an African-American teenager, Mary Luana Williams (known as Lulu),[149] whose parents were Black Panthers.[150] Fonda and Hayden divorced on June 10, 1990 in Santa Monica.[151] Fonda married her third husband, the cable-television tycoon and CNN founder Ted Turner, on December 21, 1991, at a ranch near Capps, Florida, about 20 miles east of Tallahassee.[152] The pair divorced on May 22, 2001 in Atlanta.[153] In 2009, Fonda began a relationship with the record producer Richard Perry. It ended in 2017.[154][155][156] In a 2018 interview, Fonda stated that up to age 62, she always felt she had to seek the validation of men in order to prove to herself that she had value as a person, something she attributes to the early death of her mother's leaving her without a female role model. As a consequence, she attached herself to \"alpha males\", some of whom reinforced her feelings of inadequacy, despite her professional success. Fonda said that she came to see that attitude as a failing of the men in her life: \"Some men have a hard time realizing that the woman they're married to is strong and smart and they have to diminish that, because it makes them feel diminished. Too bad we have defined masculinity in such a way that it's so easily shamed.\"[157] Fonda grew up atheist but turned to Christianity in the early 2000s. She describes her beliefs as being \"outside of established religion\" with a more feminist slant and views God as something that \"lives within each of us as Spirit (or soul).\"[158] She practices zazen and yoga.[159][160] As a child, Fonda suffered from a poor self-image and lacked confidence in her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. About that, Fonda said: I was raised in the '50s. I was taught by my father [actor Henry Fonda] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved.In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia, which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour, who died by suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout ... I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die.[161][162]Fonda was diagnosed with breast cancer and osteoporosis in her later years.[163] She underwent a lumpectomy in November 2010 and recovered.[164] In April 2019, Fonda revealed she had had a cancerous growth removed from her lower lip the previous year and pre-melanoma growths removed from her skin.[163] In 1962, Fonda was given the honorary title of \"Miss Army Recruiting\" by the Pentagon.[165] In 1981, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.[166] In 1994, the United Nations Population Fund made Fonda a Goodwill Ambassador.[167] In 2004, she was awarded the Women's eNews 21 Leaders for the 21st Century award as one of Seven Who Change Their Worlds.[168] In 2007, Fonda was awarded an Honorary Palme d'Or by Cannes Film Festival President Gilles Jacob for career achievement. Only three others had received such an award \u2013 Jeanne Moreau, Alain Resnais, and G\u00e9rard Oury.[169] In December 2008, Fonda was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts.[167] In November and December 2009, she received the National German Sustainability Award[170] and New York Women's Agenda Lifetime Achievement Award. She was also selected as the 42nd recipient (2014) of the AFI Life Achievement Award.[171] In 2017, she received a Goldene Kamera lifetime achievement award.[172] She was one of fifteen women selected to appear on the cover of the September 2019 issue of British Vogue, by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.[173]",

She is the recipient of various accolades including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, the AFI Life Achievement Award, and the Honorary Golden Lion.[3]\nBorn to actor Henry Fonda and socialite Frances Ford Seymour, Fonda made her acting debut with the 1960 Broadway play There Was a Little Girl, for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and made her screen debut later the same year with the romantic comedy Tall Story. She rose to prominence in the 1960s with such films as Period of Adjustment (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967), and Barbarella (1968). Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress twice in the 1970s for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The China Syndrome (1979), On Golden Pond (1981), and The Morning After (1986). Consecutive hits Fun with Dick and Jane (1977), California Suite (1978), The Electric Horseman (1979), and 9 to 5 (1980) sustained Fonda's box-office drawing power, and she won a Primetime Emmy Award for her performance in the TV film The Dollmaker (1984).\nIn 1982, she released her first exercise video, Jane Fonda's Workout, which became the highest-selling VHS of all time.[4] It would be the first of 22 such videos over the next 13 years, which would collectively sell over 17 million copies. Divorced from her second husband Tom Hayden, she married billionaire media mogul Ted Turner in 1991 and retired from acting, following a row of commercially unsuccessful films concluded by Stanley &amp; Iris (1990). Fonda divorced Turner in 2001 and returned to the screen with the hit Monster-in-Law (2005). Although Georgia Rule (2007) was the star's only other movie during the 2000s, in the early 2010s she fully re-launched her career. Subsequent films have included The Butler (2013), This Is Where I Leave You (2014), Youth (2015), Our Souls at Night (2017), and Book Club (2018). In 2009, she returned to Broadway after a 49-year absence from the stage, in the play 33 Variations which earned her a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, while her major recurring role in the HBO drama series The Newsroom (2012\u201314) earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She also released another five exercise videos between 2009 and 2012. Fonda currently stars as Grace Hanson in the Netflix comedy series Grace and Frankie, which debuted in 2015 and has earned her nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.\nFonda was a visible political activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War. She was photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi, during which she gained the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\". During this time, she was effectively blacklisted in Hollywood. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist and environmental activist.[5] In 2005, along with Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, she co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves on the board of the organization.\nJane Seymour Fonda was born in New York City[2] on December 21, 1937. Her parents were the Canadian-born socialite Frances Ford Brokaw (n\u00e9e Seymour; 1908\u20131950) and the American actor Henry Fonda (1905\u20131982). According to her father, the surname Fonda came from an Italian ancestor who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s.[6] There, he intermarried, and the family began to use Dutch given names, with Jane's first Fonda ancestor reaching New York in 1650.[7][8][9] Fonda also has English, French, and Scottish ancestry. She was named for the third wife of Henry VIII, Jane Seymour, to whom she is distantly related on her mother's side.[10] Her brother, Peter (1940\u20132019), was also an actor, and her maternal half-sister is Frances de Villers Brokaw (aka \"Pan\"), whose daughter is Pilar Corrias, the owner of the Pilar Corrias Gallery in London.[11]\nIn 1950, when Fonda was 12, her mother died by suicide while undergoing treatment at Craig House psychiatric hospital in Beacon, New York.[12][13] Later that year, Fonda's father married the socialite Susan Blanchard (born 1928), 23 years his junior; this marriage ended in divorce. At 15 Fonda taught dance at Fire Island Pines, New York.[14]\nFonda attended Greenwich Academy in Greenwich, Connecticut; the Emma Willard School in Troy, New York; and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York.[15] Before her acting career, she was a model and appeared twice on the cover of Vogue.[16]\nFonda became interested in acting as a teenager while appearing with her father in a charity performance of The Country Girl at the Omaha Community Playhouse.[16] After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for six months to study art.[17] Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting changed the course of her life, Fonda saying, \"I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father \u2013 who had to say so \u2013 told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!\"[18]\nFonda's stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with Tall Story, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. Frequent collaborator Robert Redford also made his debut in that film. Period of Adjustment and Walk on the Wild Side followed in 1962. The latter, in which she played a prostitute, earned her a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer.\nIn 1963, she appeared in Sunday in New York. Newsday called her \"the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses\".[19] However, she also had detractors \u2013 in the same year, the Harvard Lampoon named her the \"Year's Worst Actress\" for The Chapman Report.[20] Fonda's career breakthrough came with Cat Ballou (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm turned outlaw. This comedy Western received five Oscar nominations, with Lee Marvin winning best actor, and was one of the year's top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to bankable stardom. The following year, she had a starring role in The Chase opposite Robert Redford, in their first film together, and two-time Oscar winner Marlon Brando. The film received some positive reviews, but Fonda's performance was noticed by Variety magazine: \"Jane Fonda, as Redford's wife and the mistress of wealthy oilman James Fox, makes the most of the biggest female role.\"[21] After this came the comedies Any Wednesday (1966), opposite Jason Robards and Dean Jones, and Barefoot in the Park (1967), again co-starring Redford.\nIn 1968, she played the title role in the science fiction spoof Barbarella, which established her status as a sex symbol. In contrast, the tragedy They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969) won her critical acclaim and marked a significant turning point in her career; Variety magazine wrote, \"Fonda, as the unremittingly cynical loser, the tough and bruised babe of the Dust Bowl, gives a dramatic performance that gives the film a personal focus and an emotionally gripping power.\"[22] In addition, renowned film critic Pauline Kael, in her New Yorker review of the film, noted of Fonda: \"[She] has been a charming, witty nudie cutie in recent years and now gets a chance at an archetypal character. Fonda goes all the way with it, as screen actresses rarely do once they become stars. She doesn't try to save some ladylike part of herself, the way even a good actress like Audrey Hepburn does, peeping at us from behind \"vulgar\" roles to assure us she's not really like that. Fonda stands a good chance of personifying American tensions and dominating our movies in the seventies as Bette Davis did in the thirties.\"[23] For her performance, she won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and earned her first Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Fonda was very selective by the end of the decade, turning down lead roles in Rosemary's Baby and Bonnie and Clyde.[citation needed]\nIn the seventies, Fonda enjoyed her most critically acclaimed period as an actress despite some setbacks for her ongoing activism. According to writer and critic Hilton Als, her performances starting with They Shoot Horses, Don't They? \"heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over. Fonda's ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation.[23]\nFonda won her first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1971, again playing a prostitute, the gamine Bree Daniels, in Alan J. Pakula's murder mystery Klute. Prior to shooting, Fonda spent time interviewing several prostitutes and madams. Years later, Fonda discovered that \"there was like a marriage, a melding of souls between this character and me, this woman that I didn't think I could play because I didn't think I was call girl material. It didn't matter.\"[24] Upon its release, Klute was both a critical and commercial success, and Fonda's performance earned her widespread recognition. Pauline Kael wrote:\n\"As an actress, [Fonda] has a special kind of smartness that takes the form of speed; she's always a little ahead of everybody, and this quicker beat \u2013 this quicker responsiveness \u2013 makes her more exciting to watch. This quality works to great advantage in her full-scale, definitive portrait of a call girl in Klute. It's a good, big role for her, and she disappears into Bree, the call girl, so totally that her performance is very pure \u2013 unadorned by \"acting.\" She never stands outside Bree, she gives herself over to the role, and yet she isn't lost in it\u2014she's fully in control, and her means are extraordinarily economical. She has somehow got to a plane of acting at which even the closest closeup never reveals a false thought and, seen on the movie streets a block away, she's Bree, not Jane Fonda, walking toward us. There isn't another young dramatic actress in American films who can touch her\".[25]Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also praised Fonda's performance, even suggesting that the film should have been titled Bree after her character: \"What is it about Jane Fonda that makes her such a fascinating actress to watch? She has a sort of nervous intensity that keeps her so firmly locked into a film character that the character actually seems distracted by things that come up in the movie.\"[26] During the 1971\u20131972 awards season, Fonda dominated the Best Actress category at almost every major awards ceremony; in addition to her Oscar win, she received her first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama, her first National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress and her second New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\nBetween Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977, Fonda did not have a major film success. She appeared in A Doll's House (1973), Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird (1976). In the former, some critics felt Fonda was miscast, but her work as Nora Helmer drew praise, and a review in The New York Times opined, \"Though the Losey film is ferociously flawed, I recommend it for Jane Fonda's performance. Beforehand, it seemed fair to wonder if she could personify someone from the past; her voice, inflections, and ways of moving have always seemed totally contemporary. But once again she proves herself to be one of our finest actresses, and she's at home in the 1870s, a creature of that period as much as of ours.\"[27] From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: \"I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted.\"[28] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. \"The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed.\"[29] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.\n\u2014Fred Zinnemanndirector of Julia (1977)\nIn 1972, Fonda starred as a reporter alongside Yves Montand in Tout Va Bien, directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. The two directors then made Letter to Jane, in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda.\nThrough her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film Fun With Dick and Jane is generally considered her \"comeback\" picture. Critical reaction was mixed, but Fonda's comic performance was praised; Vincent Canby of The New York Times remarked, \"I never have trouble remembering that Miss Fonda is a fine dramatic actress but I'm surprised all over again every time I see her do comedy with the mixture of comic intelligence and abandon she shows here.\"[31] Also in 1977, she portrayed the playwright Lillian Hellman in Julia, receiving positive reviews from critics. Gary Arnold of the Washington Post described her performance as \"edgy, persuasive and intriguingly tensed-up,\" commenting further, \"Irritable, intent and agonizingly self-conscious, Fonda suggests the internal conflicts gnawing at a talented woman who craves the self-assurance, resolve and wisdom she sees in figures like Julia and Hammett.\"[32] For her performance, Fonda won her first BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, and received her third Best Actress Oscar nomination.[33]\nDuring this period, Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down An Unmarried Woman because she felt the part was not relevant. In 1978, Fonda was at a career peak after she won her second Best Actress Oscar for her role as Sally Hyde, a conflicted adulteress in Coming Home, the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran's difficulty in re-entering civilian life.[33] Upon its release, the film was a popular success with audiences, and generally received good reviews; Ebert noted that her Sally Hyde was \"the kind of character you somehow wouldn't expect the outspoken, intelligent Fonda to play,\" and Jonathan Rosenbaum of the San Diego Reader felt that Fonda was \"a marvel to watch; what fascinates and involves me in her performance are the conscientious effort and thought that seem to go into every line reading and gesture, as if the question of what a captain's wife and former cheerleader was like became a source of endless curiosity and discovery for her.\"[34] Her performance also earned her a third Golden Globe Award for Best Actress as well, making this her second consecutive win. Also in 1978, she reunited with Alan J. Pakula to star in his post-modern Western drama Comes a Horseman as a hard-bitten rancher, and later took on a supporting role in California Suite, where she played a Manhattan workaholic and divorcee. Variety noted that she \"demonstrates yet another aspect of her amazing range\"[35] and Time Out New York remarked that she gave \"another performance of unnerving sureness.\"[36]\nShe won her second BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with The China Syndrome, about a cover-up of a vulnerability in a nuclear power plant. Cast alongside Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas, in one of his early roles, Fonda played a clever, ambitious television news reporter. Vincent Canby, writing for the New York Times, singled out Fonda's performance for praise: \"The three stars are splendid, but maybe Miss Fonda is just a bit more than that. Her performance is not that of an actress in a star's role, but that of an actress creating a character that happens to be major within the film. She keeps getting better and better.\"[37] This role also earned her Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. The same year, she starred in the western adventure-romance film The Electric Horseman with her frequent co-star, Robert Redford. Although the film received mixed reviews, The Electric Horseman was a box office success, becoming the eleventh highest-grossing film of 1979[38] after grossing a domestic total of nearly $62 million.[39]\nIn 1980, Fonda starred in 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year.[40] Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship.[33] She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her.[41] The father-daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real-life relationship between the two Fondas; they eventually became the first father-daughter duo to earn Oscar nominations (Jane earned her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination) for their roles in the same film. On Golden Pond, which also starred four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.[33]\nFonda continued to appear in feature films throughout the 1980s, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for The Dollmaker (1984), and starring in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in Agnes of God (1985). The following year, she played an alcoholic actress and murder suspect in the 1986 thriller The Morning After, opposite Jeff Bridges. In preparation for her role, Fonda modelled the character on the starlet Gail Russell, who, at 36, was found dead in her apartment, among empty liquor bottles. Writing for The New Yorker, Pauline Kael commended Fonda for giving \"a raucous-voiced, down-in-the-dirty performance that has some of the charge of her Bree in Klute, back in 1971.\"[42] For her performance, she was nominated for yet another Academy Award for Best Actress.\nShe ended the decade by appearing in Old Gringo. This was followed by the romantic drama Stanley &amp; Iris (1990) with Robert De Niro, which was her final film for 15 years. Both films did not fare well at the box office, and despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, Fonda's performance as the widowed Iris in the latter was praised by Vincent Canby, who stated, \"Fonda's increasingly rich resources as an actress are evident in abundance here. They even overcome one's awareness that just beneath Iris's frumpy clothes, there is a firm, perfectly molded body that has become a multi-million-dollar industry.\"[43]\nFor many years Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after fracturing her foot while filming The China Syndrome, she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The Leni Workout became the Jane Fonda Workout, which began a second career for her, continuing for many years.[33] This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled Jane Fonda's Workout, inspired by her best-selling book, Jane Fonda's Workout Book. Jane Fonda's Workout became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series.[33] She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.[44]\nIn 1991, after three decades in film, Fonda announced her retirement from the film industry.[45] In May 2005, she returned to the screen with the box office success Monster-in-Law, starring opposite Jennifer Lopez.[33] Two years later, Fonda starred in the Garry Marshall-directed drama Georgia Rule alongside Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan. Georgia Rule was panned by critics, but A. O. Scott of The New York Times felt the film belonged to Fonda and co-star Lohan, before writing, \"Ms. Fonda's straight back and piercing eyes, the righteous jaw line she inherited from her father and a reputation for humorlessness all serve her well here, but it is her warmth and comic timing that make Georgia more than a provincial scold.\"[46]\nIn 2009, Fonda returned to Broadway for the first time since 1963, playing Katherine Brandt in Mois\u00e9s Kaufman's 33 Variations.[47][48] In a mixed review, Ben Brantley of the New York Times praised Fonda's \"layered crispness\" and her \"aura of beleaguered briskness that flirts poignantly with the ghost of her spiky, confrontational screen presence as a young woman. For those who grew up enthralled with Ms. Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\"[49] The role earned her a Tony nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.[50]\nFonda filmed her second movie in French when she had a leading role in the 2011 drama All Together.[51][52][53] The same year she starred alongside Catherine Keener in Peace, Love and Misunderstanding, playing a hippie grandmother.[54] In 2012, Fonda began a recurring role as Leona Lansing, CEO of a major media company, in HBO's original political drama The Newsroom. Her role continued throughout the show's three seasons, and Fonda received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.\nIn 2013, Fonda had a small role in The Butler, portraying First Lady Nancy Reagan. She had more film work the following year, appearing in the comedies Better Living Through Chemistry and This is Where I Leave You. She also voiced a character on The Simpsons.[55] She played an acting diva in Paolo Sorrentino's Youth in 2015, for which she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination. She also appeared in Fathers and Daughters (2015) with Russell Crowe.\nFonda appears as the co-lead in the Netflix series Grace and Frankie. She and Lily Tomlin play aging women whose husbands reveal they are in love. Filming on the first season was completed in November 2014,[56] and the show premiered online on May 8, 2015. In 2016, Fonda voiced Shuriki in Elena and the Secret of Avalor.\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Fonda and others told the stories of the people killed there.[57][58]\nFonda starred in her fourth collaboration with Robert Redford in the 2017 romantic drama film Our Souls at Night. The film and Fonda's performance received critical acclaim upon release. In 2018, she starred opposite Diane Keaton, Mary Steenburgen, and Candice Bergen in the romantic comedy film Book Club. Although opened to mixed reviews, the film was a major box office success grossing $93.4 million against a $10 million budget, despite releasing the same day as Deadpool 2.\nFonda is the subject of an HBO original documentary entitled Jane Fonda in Five Acts, directed by the documentarian Susan Lacy. Receiving rave reviews, it covers Fonda's life from childhood through her acting career and political activism and then to the present day.[59] It premiered on HBO on September 24, 2018.[60]\nDuring the 1960s, Fonda engaged in political activism in support of the Civil Rights Movement, and in opposition to the Vietnam War.[33] Fonda's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as \"small-c communism\".[61] Along with other celebrities, she supported the Alcatraz Island occupation by American Indians in 1969, which was intended to call attention to the failures of the government with regards to treaty rights and the movement for greater Indian sovereignty.[62]\nShe supported Huey Newton and the Black Panthers in the early 1970s, stating: \"Revolution is an act of love; we are the children of revolution, born to be rebels. It runs in our blood.\" She called the Black Panthers \"our revolutionary vanguard ... we must support them with love, money, propaganda and risk.\"[63] She has been involved in the feminist movement since the 1970s and dovetails her activism in support of civil rights.\nIn April 1970, Fonda, with Fred Gardner and Donald Sutherland formed the FTA tour (\"Free The Army\", a play on the troop expression \"Fuck The Army\"), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to Bob Hope's USO tour. The tour, described as \"political vaudeville\" by Fonda, visited military towns along the West Coast, aiming to establish a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (F.T.A.) which contained strong, frank criticism of the war by servicemen and servicewomen; it was released in 1972.[64]\nOn May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, to speak on GI rights and issues. The end of her presentation was met with a discomforting silence. The quiet was broken when Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage. Drunk, Corso challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: why hadn't she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? Fonda in her autobiography revisited the incident: \"I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool.\" On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president Ferrel Heady. The protesters called themselves \"They Shoot Students, Don't They?\" \u2013 a reference to Fonda's recently released film, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, which had just been screened in Albuquerque.[17]\nIn the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW and was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator.[65] On November 3, 1970, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by The New York Times, Fonda was a \"major patron\" of the VVAW.[66]\nBetween 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans \u2013 mostly civil rights activists, teachers and pastors \u2013 traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war situation with the Vietnamese. News media in the United States predominantly provided a U.S. viewpoint, and American travelers to Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return to the States.[67]  Fonda also visited Vietnam, traveling to Hanoi in July 1972 to witness firsthand the bombing damage to the dikes. After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River. Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S. Air Force were \"truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way\".[68] Sweden's ambassador to Vietnam, however, observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as \"methodic\". Other journalists reported that the attacks were \"aimed at the whole system of dikes\".[67]\nFonda was photographed seated on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun; the photo outraged a number of Americans,[69] and earned her the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\".[70] In her 2005 autobiography, she wrote that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery; she had been horrified at the implications of the pictures. In a 2011 entry at her official website, Fonda explained:\nIt happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit\u00a0... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return\u00a0... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me\u00a0... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed\u00a0... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen\u00a0... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever\u00a0... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.[71]Fonda made radio broadcasts on Hanoi Radio throughout her two-week tour, describing her visits to villages, hospitals, schools, and factories that had been bombed, and denouncing U.S. military policy.[72][73] During the course of her visit, Fonda visited American prisoners of war (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda said that those making such claims were \"hypocrites and liars and pawns\", adding about the prisoners she visited, \"These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed.\"[74] In addition, Fonda told The New York Times in 1973, \"I'm quite sure that there were incidents of torture\u00a0... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie.\"[75] Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent and exaggerated rumors which were repeated widely, and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later. Fonda, as well as the named POWs, have denied the rumors,[71] and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these allegations to be false\u2014the persons named had never met Fonda.[73]\nIn 1972, Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign, which[76] continued to mobilize antiwar activists in the US after the 1973 Paris Peace Agreement, until 1975 when the United States withdrew from Vietnam.[77]\nBecause of her tour of North Vietnam during wartime and the subsequent rumors, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military persists. For example, when a U.S. Naval Academy plebe ritually shouted out \"Goodnight, Jane Fonda!\", the entire company of midshipmen plebes, who had not yet been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam War, replied \"Goodnight, bitch!\"[78][79] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures.[80] In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he \"consider[ed] it a debt of honor\", adding \"she spit in our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did.\" Fonda refused to press charges.[81][82]\nIn a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:\nI would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. ... I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.[83]In a 60 Minutes interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a \"betrayal\" of American forces and of the \"country that gave me privilege\". Fonda said, \"The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine.\" She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: \"There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for.\" Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: \"Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war.\"[84]\nIn 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as part of Project MINARET, a program that some NSA officials have described as \"disreputable if not downright illegal\".[85][86] Fonda's communications, as well as those of her husband, Tom Hayden, were intercepted by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Under the UKUSA Agreement, intercepted data on Americans were sent to the U.S. government.[87][88]\nOn November 3, 1970, Fonda was arrested by authorities at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on suspicion of drug trafficking.[89] Her luggage was searched when she re-entered the United States after participating in an anti-war college speaking tour in Canada, and several small baggies containing pills were seized.[90] Although Fonda protested that the pills were harmless vitamins, she was booked by police and then released on bond. Fonda alleged that the arresting officer told her he was acting on direct orders from the Nixon White House.[91] As she wrote in 2009, \"I told them what [the vitamins] were but they said they were getting orders from the White House. I think they hoped this 'scandal' would cause the college speeches to be canceled and ruin my respectability.\"[89] After lab tests confirmed the pills were vitamins, the charges were dropped with little media attention.\nFonda's mugshot from the arrest, in which she raises her fist in a sign of solidarity, has since become a widely published image of the actress.[90] It was used as the poster image for the 2018 HBO documentary on Fonda, \"Jane Fonda in Five Acts\", with a giant billboard sporting the image erected in Times Square in September 2018.[92] In 2017, she began selling merchandise with her mugshot image to benefit the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power &amp; Potential.[90]\nIn early March 2017, in an interview with Brie Larson, published by People magazine, Fonda stated, \"One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it's not right.\" She said, \"I've been raped, I've been sexually abused as a child and I've been fired because I wouldn't sleep with my boss.\" She said, \"I always thought it was my fault; that I didn't do or say the right thing. I know young girls who've been raped and didn't even know it was rape. They think, 'It must have been because I said 'no' the wrong way.'\"\nThrough her work, Fonda said she wants to help abuse victims \"realize that [rape and abuse] is not our fault\". Fonda said that her difficult past led her to become such a passionate activist for women's rights. The actress is an active supporter of the V-Day movement, which works to stop violence against women and girls. In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health, which aims to help prevent teen pregnancy. She was a victim of the \"disease to please\" in her early life, which plagued many American females of her generation.  Fonda revealed in 2014 that her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, was recurrently sexually abused as young as eight, and this may have led to her suicide when Jane was 12.[93][94]\nFonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including V-Day, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit The Vagina Monologues, of which she is an honorary chairperson. She was at the first summit in 2002, bringing together founder Eve Ensler, Afghan women oppressed by the Taliban, and a Kenyan activist campaigning to save girls from genital mutilation.[95]\nIn 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta to help prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development.[96]\nOn February 16, 2004, Fonda led a march through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, with Sally Field, Eve Ensler and other women, urging Mexico to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials in helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city.[97] In 2004, she also served as a mentor to the first all-transgender cast of The Vagina Monologues.[98]\nIn the days before the September 17, 2006 Swedish elections, Fonda went to Sweden to support the new political party Feministiskt initiativ in their election campaign.[99]\nIn My Life So Far, Fonda stated that she considers patriarchy to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were \"anti-male\". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she \"still loves men\", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.[100]\nIn April 2016, Fonda said that while she was 'glad' that Bernie Sanders was running, she predicted Hillary Clinton would become the first female president, whose win Fonda believed would result in a \"violent backlash\". Fonda went on to say that we need to \"help men understand why they are so threatened \u2013 and change the way we view masculinity.\"[101]\nFonda went to Seattle, in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by Bernie Whitebear. The group had occupied part of the grounds of Fort Lawton, which was in the process of being surplussed by the United States Army and turned into a park. The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local urban Indian population, protesting that \"Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs.\"[102] The endeavor succeeded and the Daybreak Star Cultural Center was constructed in the city's Discovery Park.[103]\nIn addition to environmental reasons, Fonda has been a critic of oil pipelines because of their being built without consent on Native American Land. In 2017, Fonda responded to American President Donald Trump's mandate to resume construction of the controversial North Dakota Pipelines by saying that Trump \"does this illegally because he has not gotten consent from the tribes through whose countries this goes\" and pointing out that \"the U.S. has agreed to treaties that require them to get the consent of the people who are affected, the indigenous people who live there.\"[104]\nIn December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp.[105] She was heckled by three members of Women in Green as she arrived to meet with leading Israeli feminists.[106][unreliable source?]\nIn September 2009, she was one of more than 1,500 signatories to a letter protesting the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival's spotlight on Tel Aviv.[107] The protest letter said that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of \"the Israeli propaganda machine\" because it was supported in part by funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from Israel's conflict with the Palestinians.[108][109][110] Other signers included actor Danny Glover, musician David Byrne, journalist John Pilger, and authors Alice Walker, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.[111][112]\nRabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center stated that \"People who support letters like this are people who do not support a two-state solution. By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv, they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the State of Israel.\"[113]  Hier continued, saying that \"it is clear that the script [the protesters] are reading from might as well have been written by Hamas.\"[114]\nFonda, in The Huffington Post, said she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it \"was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers.\" She continued, writing \"the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens.\"[115] Fonda emphasized that she, \"in no way, support[s] the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people.\"[115] Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to The Huffington Post rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as \"a strong supporter and friend of Israel\".[116]\nFonda argued that the military campaign in Iraq will turn people all over the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War.[117] She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.[118]\nIn September 2005, Fonda was scheduled to join British politician and anti-war activist George Galloway at two stops on his U.S. book tour, Madison, Wisconsin and Chicago. She canceled her appearances at the last minute, citing instructions from her doctors to avoid travel following recent hip surgery.[119]\nOn January 27, 2007, Fonda participated in an anti-war rally and march held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., declaring that \"silence is no longer an option\".[120] She spoke at an anti-war rally earlier that day at the Navy Memorial, where members of the organization Free Republic picketed in a counter protest.[121]\nIn the 2004 presidential election, her name was used as a disparaging epithet against John Kerry, a former VVAW leader, who was then the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie called Kerry a \"Jane Fonda Democrat\". Kerry's opponents also circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, though they sat several rows apart.[122] A faked composite photograph, which gave a false impression that the two had shared a speaker's platform, was also circulated.[123]\nIn 2015, Fonda expressed disapproval of President Barack Obama's permitting of Arctic drilling (Petroleum exploration in the Arctic) at the Sundance Film Festival. In July, she marched in a Toronto protest called the \"March for Jobs, Justice, and Climate\", which was organized by dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and environmental activists, including Canadian author Naomi Klein. The march aimed to show businesses and politicians alike that climate change is inherently linked to issues that may seem unrelated.[124]\nIn addition to issues of civil rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau \"talked so beautifully of needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people ... and yet he has betrayed every one of the things he committed to in Paris.\"[125]\nIn October 2019, Fonda was arrested three times in consecutive weeks protesting climate change outside the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. She was arrested with members of the group Oil Change International on October 11,[126][127] with Grace and Frankie co-star Sam Waterston on October 18,[128] and with actor Ted Danson on October 25.[129] On November 1, Fonda was arrested for the fourth consecutive Friday; also arrested were Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette.[130][131]  On December 13, Sally Field was arrested.[132] On December 5 Fonda explained her position in a New York Times op-ed.[133]\nOn April 5, 2005, Random House released Fonda's autobiography My Life So Far.  The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third \"act\" will be her most significant, partly because of her commitment to the Christian religion, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered.[134]\nFonda's autobiography was well received by book critics and noted to be \"as beguiling and as maddening as Jane Fonda herself\" in its Washington Post review, calling her a \"beautiful bundle of contradictions\".[135] The New York Times called the book \"achingly poignant\".[136]\nIn January 2009, Fonda started chronicling her Broadway return in a blog with posts about topics ranging from her Pilates class to fears and excitement about her new play. She uses Twitter and has a Facebook page.[137]\nIn 2011, Fonda published a new book: Prime Time: Love, health, sex, fitness, friendship, spirit \u2013 making the most of all of your life. It offers stories from her own life as well as from the lives of others, giving her perspective on how to better live what she calls \"the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond\".[138]\nFonda's charitable works have focused on youth and education, adolescent reproductive health, environment, human services, and the arts.\nFonda marketed her highly-successful line of exercise videos and books in order to fund the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a California lobbying organization she founded with her second husband Tom Hayden in 1978.[91]\nFonda has established the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential (GCAPP) in the mid 1990s and the Fonda Family Foundation in the late 1990s.  In the mid 2000s, Fonda founded the Jane Fonda Foundation in 2004 with one million dollars of her own money as a charitable corporation with herself as president, chair, director and secretary; Fonda contributes 10 hours each week on its behalf.[139][140][141][142] In 2017, she began selling merchandise featuring her 1970 arrest mugshot on her website, the proceeds of which benefit GCAPP.[90]\nJane Fonda has been married and divorced three times. She married her first husband, the French film director Roger Vadim, on August 14, 1965 at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas.[143] The couple had a daughter, Vanessa Vadim, born on September 28, 1968 in Paris, France and named after the actress and activist Vanessa Redgrave.[144]\nOn January 19, 1973, three days after obtaining a divorce from Vadim in Santo Domingo,[145] Fonda married activist Tom Hayden in a free-form ceremony at her home in Laurel Canyon.[146] Their son, Troy O'Donovan Garity, was born on July 7, 1973 in Los Angeles and was given his paternal grandmother's maiden name, as the names \"Fonda and Hayden carried too much baggage\". Fonda and Hayden named their son after Nguyen Van Troi.[147]  Hayden chose O'Donovan as the middle name after the Irish revolutionary Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa.[148] In 1982, Fonda and Hayden unofficially adopted an African-American teenager, Mary Luana Williams (known as Lulu),[149] whose parents were Black Panthers.[150] Fonda and Hayden divorced on June 10, 1990 in Santa Monica.[151]\nFonda married her third husband, the cable-television tycoon and CNN founder Ted Turner, on December 21, 1991, at a ranch near Capps, Florida, about 20 miles east of Tallahassee.[152] The pair divorced on May 22, 2001 in Atlanta.[153]\nIn 2009, Fonda began a relationship with the record producer Richard Perry. It ended in 2017.[154][155][156]\nIn a 2018 interview, Fonda stated that up to age 62, she always felt she had to seek the validation of men in order to prove to herself that she had value as a person, something she attributes to the early death of her mother's leaving her without a female role model. As a consequence, she attached herself to \"alpha males\", some of whom reinforced her feelings of inadequacy, despite her professional success. Fonda said that she came to see that attitude as a failing of the men in her life: \"Some men have a hard time realizing that the woman they're married to is strong and smart and they have to diminish that, because it makes them feel diminished. Too bad we have defined masculinity in such a way that it's so easily shamed.\"[157]\nFonda grew up atheist but turned to Christianity in the early 2000s. She describes her beliefs as being \"outside of established religion\" with a more feminist slant and views God as something that \"lives within each of us as Spirit (or soul).\"[158] She practices zazen and yoga.[159][160]\nAs a child, Fonda suffered from a poor self-image and lacked confidence in her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. About that, Fonda said:\nI was raised in the '50s. I was taught by my father [actor Henry Fonda] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved.In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia, which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour, who died by suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said,\nIt was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout ... I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die.[161][162]Fonda was diagnosed with breast cancer and osteoporosis in her later years.[163] She underwent a lumpectomy in November 2010 and recovered.[164] In April 2019, Fonda revealed she had had a cancerous growth removed from her lower lip the previous year and pre-melanoma growths removed from her skin.[163]\nIn 1962, Fonda was given the honorary title of \"Miss Army Recruiting\" by the Pentagon.[165]\nIn 1981, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.[166]\nIn 1994, the United Nations Population Fund made Fonda a Goodwill Ambassador.[167] In 2004, she was awarded the Women's eNews 21 Leaders for the 21st Century award as one of Seven Who Change Their Worlds.[168] In 2007, Fonda was awarded an Honorary Palme d'Or by Cannes Film Festival President Gilles Jacob for career achievement. Only three others had received such an award \u2013 Jeanne Moreau, Alain Resnais, and G\u00e9rard Oury.[169]\nIn December 2008, Fonda was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts.[167] In November and December 2009, she received the National German Sustainability Award[170] and New York Women's Agenda Lifetime Achievement Award.  She was also selected as the 42nd recipient (2014) of the AFI Life Achievement Award.[171]\nIn 2017, she received a Goldene Kamera lifetime achievement award.[172]\nShe was one of fifteen women selected to appear on the cover of the September 2019 issue of British Vogue, by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.[173]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nMichelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama (n\u00e9e Robinson; born January 17, 1964) is an American lawyer, university administrator, and writer, who was the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. She is married to the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama, and she was the first African American First Lady of the United States. Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met Barack Obama. She subsequently worked in non-profits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago as well as the vice president for Community and External Affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters. Obama campaigned for her husband's presidential bid throughout 2007 and 2008, delivering a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She returned to speak for him at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, she delivered a speech in support of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, a former first lady. As first lady, Obama served as a role model for women and worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon.[1][2] Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935\u20131991),[3] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (b. July 30, 1937), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[4] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[5] The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[3] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Low Country region.[6] Her paternal great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[7][8] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[9][10] Her grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr. built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (n\u00e9e Johnson) returned to the Low Country from Chicago after retirement.[7] Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[11] As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[12] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Michelle Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[12] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio in the 20th century.[11] All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the U.S. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[11] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[13] Among her contemporary extended family is rabbi Capers Funnye; born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her grandfather Robinson's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. Funnye converted to Judaism after college. He is a paternal first cousin once-removed.[14][15] Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[4][16][17][18] She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\".[19] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[20] She played piano,[21] learning from her great-aunt who was a piano teacher.[22] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[16] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[16] She and her 21-month older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[4][23] Her father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound emotional effect on her as she was growing up. She was determined to stay out of trouble and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her.[24] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[25] She attended Whitney Young High School,[26] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[20] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[27] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\".[28][29] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[30] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[4] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[27] Robinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981.[31][5] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[4] Robinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\".[32][33] She believed that her brother's status as an alumnus \u2014 he graduated in 1983,[34] before being hired as a basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University[35] \u2014 may have helped her during the admission process,[36] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth.[34] She has stated that she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[37] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[38] The mother of a white roommate reportedly tried (unsuccessfully) to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race.[31] Robinson said that being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\".[39][40] There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked\", she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"[27] While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students. She ran their day care center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children.[41] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt that it should be more conversational.[42] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[43][44] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[45] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[46] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\".[45] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said that she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".[47] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[48] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[49] She is the third First Lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[50] She later said that her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[51] Robinson's father, Fraser C. Robinson III, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[52] She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[38] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm, in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[53] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[54] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[55] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[56] Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[57] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989).[58] Barack Obama has said that the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other, since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\".[59] They married on October 3, 1992.[56] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[60] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[61] The Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996, and to the US Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for US President, Michelle Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week\u00a0\u2013 to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.[62] She once requested that her then-fianc\u00e9 meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[19] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[63][64] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\"[65] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.[66] The Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[67] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[5] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[68][69] In 2008 Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children.[70] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[69] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved into the White House to assist with child care.[71] Michelle Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"[72] The Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better \u2013 no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues \u2013 they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"[73] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[4] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[74][75] In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the Mayor, and as Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became Executive Director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[26] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood 12 years after she left.[20] Obama later said that she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".[76] In 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the University's Community Service Center.[77] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as Vice President for Community and External Affairs.[78] She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008, but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[79] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[80] According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, and investments and royalties from his books.[81] Obama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:\u00a0THS),[82] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL-CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[83] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[84] During an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[85] Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[86][87] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[88] At first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[89] She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[90] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\".[63][91][92] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[42] In May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[19] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement in which she traveled to political events only two days a week and rarely traveled overnight;[93] by early February 2008 her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[64] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[94][95] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[27] During the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\"[96][97][98] and some web sites attempted to promote this image.[99] Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"[100] By the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[86] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[96] her appearance on The View was widely covered in the press.[101] The presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[91] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[81][90] New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal\u00a0\u2013 a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god\u00a0... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[91][102] On the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[103] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[104] Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\"[105] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt 'proud of her country for the first time'.[104][106][107] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[108] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[109] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[110] On an October 6, 2008 broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said that her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[111] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[112] On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas on the night that he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air and the show was cancelled.[113][114] Obama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[115] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[116][117] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[118] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[119] An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\".[120] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[118] Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said that Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[121] Prior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[122] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[123][124] The consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter 'won' the debate.[125] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the First Lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[126] Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said that the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[127] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[128][129] But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, \"...nobody votes for first lady.\"[130] During her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[131] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[131][132] Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said that she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[133] On June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[134] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker. In 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of the year.[135] In her memoir, Becoming, Obama describes her four primary initiatives as First Lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[136] Let Girls Learn,[137] and Joining Forces.[138] Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[139][140] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[140] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV).The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[141] Obama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[142] In November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[143][144][145] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\"[143] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\"[144][145] Supporters of Obama note that the First Lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[146] In May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The First Lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[147] Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".[148] Over the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[149] A potential Michelle Obama candidacy was supported by both Samuel L. Jackson and James Clyburn.[150] On April 6, 2009, CNN did a poll on whether she should run for the presidency in 2020, 83% of responders being opposed to the idea.[151] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders.[152][153] Another poll from that month found 71% of Americans believed that Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[153] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the First Lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\"[154][155] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\".[156] In the epilogue to Becoming, Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\"[157] recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"[158] Obama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[159][160][161][162] In January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[161][163] On February 9, 2010, the First Lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[164] Michelle Obama said that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\"[161] Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[165] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[166] Several Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[167] In January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican Governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the First Lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[168][169] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\"[170] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife was First Lady.[171] In the 2008 US presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democrat groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the US Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case and drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"[172][173][174] After the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[175] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[176] Michelle said \"This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.\"[177]At the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it\u00a0... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"[178] In May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[179] In August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[180][181] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the First Lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".[182][183] In March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[184] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[185][186] In July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[187] In October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[188] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[189] On April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace, Obama embracing her before attending an event with world leaders.[190] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[191][192] In April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[193] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[194][195] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places\", citing herself and her husband as examples.[196][197] Obama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Gra\u00e7a Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[198] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[199][200] In March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[201][202] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said that the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples\".[203][204] In January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[205][206] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[207] even being praised in some corners.[208] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[209] In June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[210] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[30][211][212] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school, which had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[213] In March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[214][215] Later that month, the First Couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[216] meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri.[217][218] Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[219][220] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[221][222] By the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[223] Though Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[224] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[225] She toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[226] Though viewed as essential by the White House, aides reported that she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[227] After the elections took place, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".[228] Obama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized that she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular\".[229] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[230] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\".[231][232] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[230] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[233] Obama raised her profile in October,[234][235] touring three states in four days.[233] Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".[236][237] Obama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[238] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[239] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[240] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regards to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[241][242] With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\".[243][244] In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of 'The Harvard 100'; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[243][245] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list.[246] She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.[247][248] At the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans.[249][250] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[251] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[252][253] Obama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[131][254] as she was accepted as a role model.[131] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.[255] Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\"[254] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[244] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[256] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[256][257] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[258] Obama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style,[246] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[259][260] Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\".[50] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than 50 design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14\u00a0million to a company.[261] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[262] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[263][264] Obama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[265][266] Every First Lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[265] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[267] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[268] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[269] During the 2013 Academy Awards, she became the first First Lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture which went to Argo).[270] The media have been criticized for focusing more on the First Lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[50][271] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[249][272][273] In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erb\u00e9 argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[274] and stated that Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[71][275] In May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[276] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[277] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[278] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[279] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[280] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[281] During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[282] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[283] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[284] Obama's memoir, Becoming was released in November 2018. It had sold 10 million copies by late March 2019.[285][286] Despite speculation that she would be running for president in 2020, Barack Obama stated during a campaign rally in Nevada that Michelle would not be running for president in 2020. She has previously stated that she has no passion for politics.[287]",

She is married to the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama, and she was the first African American First Lady of the United States.\nRaised on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met Barack Obama. She subsequently worked in non-profits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago as well as the vice president for Community and External Affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters.\nObama campaigned for her husband's presidential bid throughout 2007 and 2008, delivering a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She returned to speak for him at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, she delivered a speech in support of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, a former first lady.\nAs first lady, Obama served as a role model for women and worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon.[1][2]\nMichelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935\u20131991),[3] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (b. July 30, 1937), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[4] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[5]\nThe Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans  in the American South.[3] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Low Country region.[6] Her paternal great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[7][8] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[9][10] Her grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr. built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (n\u00e9e Johnson) returned to the Low Country from Chicago after retirement.[7]\nAmong her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[11]\nAs was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[12] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Michelle Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[12] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio in the 20th century.[11]\nAll four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the U.S. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[11] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[13] Among her contemporary extended family is rabbi Capers Funnye; born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her grandfather Robinson's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. Funnye converted to Judaism after college. He is a paternal first cousin once-removed.[14][15]\nRobinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[4][16][17][18] She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\".[19] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[20] She played piano,[21] learning from her great-aunt who was a piano teacher.[22] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[16] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[16] She and her 21-month older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[4][23]\nHer father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound emotional effect on her as she was growing up. She was determined to stay out of trouble and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her.[24] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[25] She attended Whitney Young High School,[26] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[20] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[27] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\".[28][29] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[30] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[4] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[27]\nRobinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981.[31][5] \nShe majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[4]\nRobinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\".[32][33] She believed that her brother's status as an alumnus \u2014 he graduated in 1983,[34] before being hired as a basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University[35] \u2014 may have helped her during the admission process,[36] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth.[34] She has stated that she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[37] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[38]\nThe mother of a white roommate reportedly tried (unsuccessfully) to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race.[31] Robinson said that being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\".[39][40] There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked\", she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"[27]\nWhile at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students. She ran their day care center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children.[41] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt that it should be more conversational.[42] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[43][44] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[45]\nRobinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[46] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\".[45] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said that she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".[47]\nAt Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[48] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[49] She is the third First Lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[50] She later said that her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[51]\nRobinson's father, Fraser C. Robinson III, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[52] She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[38] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm, in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[53]\nRobinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[54] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[55] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[56]\nBefore meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[57] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989).[58] Barack Obama has said that the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other, since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\".[59] They married on October 3, 1992.[56] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[60] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[61]\nThe Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996, and to the US Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for US President, Michelle Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week\u00a0\u2013 to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.[62]\nShe once requested that her then-fianc\u00e9 meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[19] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[63][64] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\"[65] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.[66]\nThe Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[67] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[5] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[68][69] In 2008 Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children.[70] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[69] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved into the White House to assist with child care.[71]\nMichelle Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"[72]\nThe Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better \u2013 no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues \u2013 they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"[73]\nFollowing law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley &amp; Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[4] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[74][75]\nIn 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the Mayor, and as Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became Executive Director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[26] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood 12 years after she left.[20] Obama later said that she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".[76]\nIn 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the University's Community Service Center.[77] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as Vice President for Community and External Affairs.[78]\nShe continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008, but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[79] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[80]\nAccording to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, and investments and royalties from his books.[81]\nObama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:\u00a0THS),[82] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL-CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[83] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[84]\nDuring an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[85]\nAlthough she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[86][87] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[88]\nAt first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[89] She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[90] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\".[63][91][92] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[42]\nIn May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[19] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement in which she traveled to political events only two days a week and rarely traveled overnight;[93] by early February 2008 her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[64] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[94][95] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[27]\nDuring the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\"[96][97][98] and some web sites attempted to promote this image.[99] Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"[100]\nBy the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[86] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[96] her appearance on The View was widely covered in the press.[101]\nThe presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[91] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[81][90]\nNew York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: \nI wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal\u00a0\u2013 a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god\u00a0... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[91][102]\nOn the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[103] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[104] Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\"[105] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt 'proud of her country for the first time'.[104][106][107] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[108] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[109] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[110]\nOn an October 6, 2008 broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said that her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[111] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[112] On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas on the night that he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air and the show was cancelled.[113][114]\nObama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[115] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[116][117] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[118] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[119] An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\".[120] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity.\nObama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[118] Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said that Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[121]\nPrior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[122] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[123][124] The consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter 'won' the debate.[125] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the First Lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[126]\nObama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said that the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[127] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[128][129] But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, \"...nobody votes for first lady.\"[130]\nDuring her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[131] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[131][132]\nObama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said that she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[133]\nOn June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[134] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker.\nIn 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of the year.[135]\nIn her memoir, Becoming, Obama describes her four primary initiatives as First Lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[136] Let Girls Learn,[137] and Joining Forces.[138] Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[139][140] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[140] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV).The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[141]\nObama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[142]\nIn November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[143][144][145] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\"[143] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\"[144][145] Supporters of Obama note that the First Lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[146]\nIn May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The First Lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[147] Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".[148]\nOver the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[149] A potential Michelle Obama candidacy was supported by both Samuel L. Jackson and James Clyburn.[150] On April 6, 2009, CNN did a poll on whether she should run for the presidency in 2020, 83% of responders being opposed to the idea.[151] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders.[152][153] Another poll from that month found 71% of Americans believed that Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[153] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the First Lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\"[154][155] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\".[156] In the epilogue to Becoming, Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\"[157] recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"[158]\nObama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[159][160][161][162]\nIn January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[161][163] On February 9, 2010, the First Lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[164]\nMichelle Obama said that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\"[161] Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[165] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[166]\nSeveral Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[167]\nIn January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican Governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the First Lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[168][169] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\"[170] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife was First Lady.[171]\nIn the 2008 US presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democrat groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the US Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case and drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"[172][173][174]\nAfter the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[175] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[176] Michelle said \n\"This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.\"[177]At the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it\u00a0... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"[178]\nIn May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[179]\nIn August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[180][181] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the First Lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".[182][183]\nIn March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[184] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[185][186]\nIn July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[187]\nIn October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[188] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[189]\nOn April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace, Obama embracing her before attending an event with world leaders.[190] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[191][192]\nIn April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[193] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[194][195] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places\", citing herself and her husband as examples.[196][197]\nObama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Gra\u00e7a Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[198] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[199][200]\nIn March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[201][202] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said that the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples\".[203][204]\nIn January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[205][206] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[207] even being praised in some corners.[208] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[209]\nIn June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[210] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[30][211][212] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school, which had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[213]\nIn March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[214][215] Later that month, the First Couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[216] meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri.[217][218]\nObama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[219][220] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[221][222]\nBy the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[223]\nThough Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[224] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[225]\nShe toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[226] Though viewed as essential by the White House, aides reported that she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[227] After the elections took place, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".[228]\nObama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized that she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular\".[229] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[230] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\".[231][232] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[230] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[233] Obama raised her profile in October,[234][235] touring three states in four days.[233] Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".[236][237]\nObama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[238] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[239] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[240] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regards to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[241][242]\nWith the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\".[243][244] In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of 'The Harvard 100'; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[243][245] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list.[246] She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.[247][248]\nAt the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans.[249][250] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[251] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[252][253]\nObama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[131][254] as she was accepted as a role model.[131] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.[255] Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\"[254] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[244] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[256] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[256][257] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[258]\nObama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style,[246] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[259][260] Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\".[50] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than 50 design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14\u00a0million to a company.[261] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[262] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[263][264]\nObama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[265][266] Every First Lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[265] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[267] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[268] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[269] During the 2013 Academy Awards, she became the first First Lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture which went to Argo).[270]\nThe media have been criticized for focusing more on the First Lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[50][271] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[249][272][273] In 2008 U.S. News &amp; World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erb\u00e9 argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[274] and stated that Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[71][275]\nIn May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[276] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[277] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[278] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[279] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[280] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[281] During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[282] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[283] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[284]\nObama's memoir, Becoming was released in November 2018. It had sold 10 million copies by late March 2019.[285][286]\nDespite speculation that she would be running for president in 2020, Barack Obama stated during a campaign rally in Nevada that Michelle would not be running for president in 2020. She has previously stated that she has no passion for politics.[287]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nKristoffer Kristofferson (born June 22, 1936) is an American singer-songwriter and actor. Among his songwriting credits are the songs \"Me and Bobby McGee\", \"For the Good Times\", \"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\", and \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\", all of which were hits for other artists. Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with Nashville songwriters such as Shel Silverstein.[1] In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash in forming the country music supergroup The Highwaymen, and formed a key creative force in the outlaw country music movement that eschewed the Nashville music machine in favor of independent songwriting and producing. In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He is also known for his starring roles in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Heaven's Gate, Blade and A Star Is Born, the last of which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Kristoffer Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, to Mary Ann (n\u00e9e Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a U.S. Army Air Corps officer (later a U.S. Air Force major general).[2] His paternal grandparents emigrated from Sweden, while his mother had English, Scots-Irish, German, Swiss-German, and Dutch ancestry. Kristofferson's paternal grandfather was an officer in the Swedish Army. When Kristofferson was a child, his father pushed him towards a military career.[3] At the age of 17, Kristofferson took a summer job with a dredging contractor on Wake Island. He called it \"the hardest job I ever had.\"[4] Like most \"military brats\", Kristofferson moved around frequently as a youth, finally settling down in San Mateo, California, where he graduated from San Mateo High School in 1954. An aspiring writer, Kristofferson enrolled in Pomona College that same year. Kris Kristofferson's early writing included essays which won him prizes, and \"The Rock\" and \"Gone Are the Days\" were published in The Atlantic Monthly. These early stories reveal the roots of Kris' passions and concerns. \"The Rock\" is about a geographical feature that resembled the form of a woman. while the latter was about a racial incident.[5] He experienced his first dose of fame in 1958 when he appeared in Sports Illustrated's \"Faces in the Crowd\" on March 31 for his achievements in collegiate Rugby Union, American football, and track and field.[6] He and his classmates revived the Claremont Colleges Rugby Club in 1958, which has remained a Southern California rugby institution. Kristofferson graduated in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, summa cum laude, in literature. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year. In a 2004 interview with Pomona College Magazine, Kristofferson mentioned philosophy professor Frederick Sontag as an important influence in his life.[7] Kristofferson earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, where he studied at Merton College.[8] While at Oxford, he was awarded his Blue for boxing,[8] played rugby for his college, and began writing songs. At Oxford, he was also acquainted with fellow Rhodes scholar, art critic, and poet Michael Fried. With the help of his manager, Larry Parnes, Kristofferson recorded for Top Rank Records under the name Kris Carson. Parnes was working to sell Kristofferson as \"a Yank at Oxford\" to the British public; Kristofferson was willing to accept that promotional approach if it helped his singing career, which he hoped would enable him to progress towards his goal of becoming a novelist.[9] This early phase of his music career was unsuccessful.[10] In 1960, Kristofferson graduated with a B.Phil. degree in English literature.[8][11][12] The following year he married his longtime girlfriend, Frances Mavia Beer.[8] Kristofferson, under pressure from his family, joined the U.S. Army, was commissioned as a second lieutenant and attained the rank of captain. He became a helicopter pilot after receiving flight training at Fort Rucker, Alabama. He also completed Ranger School. During the early-1960s, he was stationed in West Germany as a member of the 8th Infantry Division.[13] During this time, he resumed his music career and formed a band. In 1965, when his tour in Germany ended, Kristofferson was given an assignment to teach English literature at West Point.[14] Instead, he decided to leave the Army and pursue songwriting. His family disowned him because of his career decision, and sources are unclear on whether or not they reconciled.[15][16][17] They saw it as a rejection of everything they stood for, in spite of the fact that Kristofferson has said he is proud of his time in the military, and received the Veteran of the Year Award at the 2003 American Veterans Awards ceremony.[18][19] After leaving the army in 1965, Kristofferson moved to Nashville. He worked at a variety of odd jobs while struggling for success in music while burdened with medical expenses resulting from his son's defective esophagus. He and his wife soon divorced. He got a job sweeping floors at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville. He met June Carter there and asked her to give Johnny Cash a tape of his. She did, but Cash put it on a large pile with others. He also worked as a commercial helicopter pilot for south Louisiana firm Petroleum Helicopters International (PHI), based in Lafayette, Louisiana. Kristofferson recalled of his days as a pilot, \"That was about the last three years before I started performing, before people started cutting my songs. I would work a week down here [in south Louisiana] for PHI, sitting on an oil platform and flying helicopters. Then I'd go back to Nashville at the end of the week and spend a week up there trying to pitch the songs, then come back down and write songs for another week. I can remember \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" I wrote sitting on top of an oil platform. I wrote \"Bobby McGee\" down here, and a lot of them [in south Louisiana].\"[20] Weeks after giving Carter his tapes, Kristofferson landed a helicopter in Cash's front yard, gaining his full attention.[21] A story about Kristofferson having a beer in one hand and some songs in the other upon arrival was reputed, but has been disproven, with Kristofferson saying that, \"It was still kind of an invasion of privacy that I wouldn't recommend. To be honest, I don't think he was there... John had a pretty creative memory\".[22] But upon hearing Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\", Cash decided to record it, and that year Kristofferson won Songwriter of the Year at the Country Music Awards. In 1966, Dave Dudley released a successful Kristofferson single, \"Viet Nam Blues\". In 1967, Kristofferson signed to Epic Records and released a single, \"Golden Idol/Killing Time\", but the song was not successful. Within the next few years, more Kristofferson originals hit the charts, performed by Roy Drusky (\"Jody and the Kid\"); Billy Walker & the Tennessee Walkers (\"From the Bottle to the Bottom\"); Ray Stevens (\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\"); Jerry Lee Lewis (\"Once More with Feeling\"); Faron Young (\"Your Time's Comin'\"); and Roger Miller (\"Me and Bobby McGee\", \"Best of all Possible Worlds\", and \"Darby's Castle\"). He achieved some success as a performer himself, following Johnny Cash's introduction of him at the Newport Folk Festival. Kristofferson signed with Monument Records as a recording artist. In addition to running that label, Fred Foster also served as manager of Combine Music, Kristofferson's songwriting label. His debut album for Monument in 1970 was Kristofferson, which included a few new songs, as well as many of his previous hits. Sales were poor, although this debut album would become a success the following year when it was re-released under the title Me & Bobby McGee. Kristofferson's compositions were still in demand. Ray Price (\"For the Good Times\"), Gladys Knight & The Pips (\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\"), Waylon Jennings (\"The Taker\"), Bobby Bare (\"Come Sundown\"), Johnny Cash (\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\"), and Sammi Smith (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\") all recorded successful versions of his songs in the early-1970s. \"For the Good Times\" (Ray Price) won \"Song of the Year\" in 1970 from the Academy of Country Music, while \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" (Johnny Cash) won the same award from the Academy's rival, the Country Music Association, in the same year. This is the only time an individual received the same award from these two organizations in the same year for different songs. In 1971, Janis Joplin, who dated Kristofferson for some time until her death, had a number one hit with \"Me and Bobby McGee\" from her posthumous album Pearl. When released, it stayed on the number-one spot on the charts for weeks. More hits followed from others: Ray Price (\"I'd Rather Be Sorry\"); Joe Simon (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\"); Bobby Bare (\"Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends\"); O.C. Smith (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\"); Jerry Lee Lewis (\"Me and Bobby McGee\"); Patti Page (\"I'd Rather Be Sorry\"); and Peggy Little (\"I've Got to Have You\"). Country music performer Kenny Rogers has also recorded some of Kristofferson's compositions, including a version of \"Me and Bobby McGee\" in 1969 with The First Edition for the Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town album. Kristofferson released his second album, The Silver Tongued Devil and I in 1971. It included \"Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)\". It was a success and established Kristofferson's career as a recording artist in his own right. Soon after, Kristofferson made his acting debut in The Last Movie (directed by Dennis Hopper) and appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival. A portion of his Isle of Wight performance is featured on the three disc compilation, The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies. In 1971, he acted in Cisco Pike and released his third album, Border Lord. The album was all-new material and sales were sluggish. He also swept the Grammy Awards that year with numerous songs nominated, winning country song of the year for \"Help Me Make It Through the Night.\" Kristofferson's 1972 fourth album, Jesus Was a Capricorn, initially had slow sales, but the third single, \"Why Me,\" was a success and significantly increased album sales. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on November 8, 1973.[23] In 1972, Kristofferson appeared with Rita Coolidge on British TV on BBC's \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\", performing a physically intimate version of \"Help Me Make It Through The Night\". For the next several years, Kristofferson focused on acting. He appeared in Blume in Love (1973) directed by Paul Mazursky, and three Sam Peckinpah films: Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974), and Convoy (1978). He continued acting in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), Vigilante Force (1976), and The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea (film) (1976), the romantic drama A Star Is Born (1976) with Barbra Streisand, for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor soon followed. At the peak of his box office power, Kristofferson turned down William Friedkin's Sorcerer (1977) and the romantic war film Hanover Street (1979). Despite his success with Streisand, Kristofferson's solo musical career headed downward with his non-charting ninth album, Shake Hands with the Devil. His next film, the two-part 1979 NBC-TV movie Freedom Road, did not get good ratings. Kristofferson was next cast in the lead role as the enigmatic Sheriff James Averill in Michael Cimino's bleak and sprawling 1980 anti-Western Heaven's Gate. Despite being a scandalous studio-bankrupting and industry-changing failure at the time (it cost Kristofferson his Hollywood A-list status), the film gained critical recognition in subsequent years. In 1986, he starred in The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James with Johnny Cash and Flashpoint in 1984, directed by William Tannen. In 1987, Kristofferson starred in the seven-episode TV series Amerika with Robert Urich and Christine Lahti. In 1989, he was the male lead in the film Millennium with Cheryl Ladd. In 1996, he earned a supporting role as Charlie Wade, a corrupt South Texas sheriff in John Sayles's Lone Star, a film nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay. In 1997, he co-starred in the film Fire Down Below with Steven Seagal. In 1998, he took a role in the film Blade, alongside Wesley Snipes, as Blade's mentor Abraham Whistler. He reprised the role in Blade II (2002) and again in Blade: Trinity (2004). In 1998 he starred in Dance with Me along with Vanessa Williams and Chayanne. In 1999, he co-starred with Mel Gibson in Payback. He was then in the 2001 Tim Burton version of Planet of the Apes. He has also played the title character \"Yohan\" as an old man in the Norwegian film Yohan\u2014the Children Wanderer. He co-starred in the 2011 film Dolphin Tale and its 2014 sequel, Dolphin Tale 2. In 2012, Kristofferson was in Joyful Noise with longtime friend, Dolly Parton. In 2013, Kristofferson co-starred in The Motel Life, as well as Angels Sing with Willie Nelson and Lyle Lovett. In 2006, Kristofferson starred with Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold in the film Disappearances about whiskey running from Quebec to the US during the Great Depression. After his singing success in the early-1970s, Kristofferson met singer Rita Coolidge. They married in 1973 and released an album titled Full Moon, another success buoyed by numerous hit singles and Grammy nominations. However, his fifth album, Spooky Lady's Sideshow, released in 1974, was a commercial failure, setting the trend for most of the rest of his musical career. Artists such as Ronnie Milsap and Johnny Duncan continued to record Kristofferson's material with success, but his distinctively rough voice and anti-pop sound kept his own audience to a minimum. Meanwhile, more artists took his songs to the top of the charts, including Willie Nelson, whose 1979 LP release of (Willie Nelson) Sings Kristofferson reached nummber five on the U.S. Country Music chart and certified Platinum in the U.S. In 1979, Kris Kristofferson traveled to Havana, Cuba, to participate in the historic Havana Jam festival that took place on March 2\u20134, alongside Rita Coolidge, Stephen Stills, the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the Trio of Doom, Fania All-Stars, Billy Swan, Bonnie Bramlett, Mike Finnegan, Weather Report, and Billy Joel, plus an array of Cuban artists such as Irakere, Pacho Alonso, Tata G\u00fcines, and Orquesta Arag\u00f3n. His performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary Havana Jam '79. On November 18, 1979, Kristofferson and Coolidge appeared on The Muppet Show, where Kristofferson sang \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" with Miss Piggy, Coolidge sang \"We're All Alone\" with forest animals, and the pair sang \"Song I'd Like to Sing\" with the Muppet monsters. In 1982, Kristofferson participated (with Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, and Brenda Lee) on The Winning Hand, a double album consisting of remastered and updated performances of recordings the four artists had made for the Monument label during the mid-1960s; the album reached the top-ten on the U.S. country album charts. He married again, to Lisa Meyers, and concentrated on films for a time, appearing in The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck, Flashpoint, and Songwriter, the last of which also starred Willie Nelson. Kristofferson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. Music from Songwriter (an album of Nelson-Kristofferson duets) was a massive country success. Nelson and Kristofferson continued their partnership, and added Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash to form the supergroup The Highwaymen. Their first album, Highwayman, was a success, and the supergroup continued working together for a time. The single from the album, also entitled \"Highwayman\", and especially written for them by Jimmy Webb, was awarded the ACM's single of the year in 1985.[24] In 1985, Kristofferson starred in Trouble in Mind and released Repossessed, a politically aware album that was a country success, particularly \"They Killed Him\" (also performed by Bob Dylan), a tribute to his heroes, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Jesus, and Mahatma Gandhi. Kristofferson also appeared in Amerika at about the same time, a miniseries that attempted to depict life in America under Soviet control. In spite of the success of Highwayman 2 in 1990, Kristofferson's solo recording career slipped significantly in the early-1990s, though he continued to record successfully with the Highwaymen. Lone Star (1996 film by John Sayles) reinvigorated Kristofferson's acting career, and he soon appeared in Blade, Blade II, Blade: Trinity, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, Fire Down Below, Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, Chelsea Walls, Payback, The Jacket, and Fast Food Nation. The Songwriters Hall of Fame inducted Kristofferson in 1985, as had the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame earlier, in 1977. In 1999, The Austin Sessions, was released, an album on which Kristofferson reworked some of his favorite songs with the help of artists such as Mark Knopfler, Steve Earle, and Jackson Browne. In 2003, Broken Freedom Song was released, a live album recorded in San Francisco. In 2003, he received the \"Spirit of Americana\" free speech award from The Americana Music Association.[25] In 2004, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2006, he received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and released his first album full of new material in 11 years; This Old Road. On April 21, 2007, Kristofferson won CMT's Johnny Cash Visionary Award. Rosanne Cash, Cash's daughter, presented the honor during the April 16 awards show in Nashville. Previous recipients include Cash, Hank Williams, Jr., Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire, and the Dixie Chicks. \"John was my hero before he was my friend, and anything with his name on it is really an honor in my eyes,\" Kristofferson said during a phone interview. \"I was thinking back to when I first met him, and if I ever thought that I'd be getting an award with his name on it, it would have carried me through a lot of hard times.\"[26] In July 2007, Kristofferson was featured on CMT's \"Studio 330 Sessions\" where he played many of his hits. On June 13, 2008, Kristofferson performed an acoustic in the round set with Patty Griffin and Randy Owen (Alabama) for a special taping of a PBS songwriters series aired in December. Each performer played five songs. Kristofferson's set included \"The Best of All Possible Worlds\", \"Darby's Castle\", \"Casey's Last Ride\", \"Me and Bobby McGee\", and \"Here Comes that Rainbow Again\". Taping was done in Nashville. Kristofferson released a new album of original songs entitled Closer to the Bone on September 29, 2009. It is produced by Don Was on the New West label. Prior to the release, Kristofferson remarked: \"I like the intimacy of the new album. It has a general mood of reflecting on where we all are at this time of life.\"[27] On November 10, 2009, Kristofferson was honored as a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI Country Awards. Throughout his career, Kristofferson's songwriting has garnered 48 BMI Country and Pop Awards.[28] He later remarked, \"The great thing about being a songwriter is you can hear your baby interpreted by so many people that have creative talents vocally that I don't have.\"[29] Kristofferson had always denied having a good voice, and has said that as he's aged, what quality it might once have had commenced to decay.[30] In December 2009, it was announced that Kristofferson would be portraying Joe in the upcoming album Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, a collaboration between rock singer John Mellencamp and novelist Stephen King.[31] On May 11, 2010, Light in the Attic Records released demos that were recorded during Kristofferson's janitorial stint at Columbia. Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends: The Publishing Demos is the first time these recordings have been released and includes material that would later be featured on other Kristofferson recordings and on the recordings of other prominent artists, such as the original recording of \"Me and Bobby McGee\". On June 4, 2011, Kristofferson performed a solo acoustic show at the Maui Arts and Cultural Center, showcasing both some of his original hits made famous by other artists, and newer songs. In early-2013, Kristofferson released a new album of original songs called Feeling Mortal. A live album titled An Evening With Kris Kristofferson was released in September 2014. Kris Kristofferson voiced the character Chief Hanlon of the NCR Rangers in the hit 2010 video game Fallout: New Vegas. In an interview for Las Vegas magazine Q&A by Matt Kelemen on October 23, 2015, he revealed that a new album, The Cedar Creek Sessions, recorded in Austin, would include some old and some new songs.[32] In December 2016, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Americana Album.[33] Kristofferson covered Brandi Carlile's \"Turpentine\" on the 2017 album Cover Stories.[34] Kristofferson performed, with assistance from Brandi Carlile, the Joni Mitchell composition A Case of You, from the 1971 Mitchell album Blue, on November 7, 2018 at the Both Sides Now - Joni 75 A Birthday Celebration to celebrate the 75th birthday of Joni Mitchell.[35] Kristofferson was announced on June 28 as being one of the supporting artists, alongside Bryan Ferry, for a Barbra Streisand \"exclusive European concert\" on July 7, 2019 in London's Hyde Park as part of the Barclay's Summertime Concert series. Kristofferson married Lisa Meyers in 1983. They own a home in Los Flores Canyon in Malibu, California,[36] and maintain a residence in Hana on the island of Maui. Kristofferson has encountered a few serious medical issues in the past few decades. He had successful bypass surgery in 1999, but from 2004 to 2015 suffered from what was finally diagnosed as Lyme disease, although it was initially and incorrectly thought to be early onset Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear how Kristofferson contracted Lyme disease but it is suspected that he caught it while filming a movie in the woods of Vermont in 2002. His wife credits the successful diagnosis and recovery to getting second opinions when dealing with auto-immune and Alzheimer-type diagnoses. Kristofferson is currently being treated by a specialist in California \"who added antibiotic intramuscular injections to Kris's protocol and is continuing to treat Kris\", his wife reported.[36][37] Kristofferson has eight children from three marriages: daughter Tracy (b. 1962) and son Kris (b. 1968) from his first marriage to Fran Beer; daughter Casey (b. 1974) from his second marriage, to Rita Coolidge; and Jesse (b. 1983), Jody (b. 1985), Johnny (b. 1988), Kelly Marie (b. 1990), and Blake (b. 1994) from his marriage to his current wife, Lisa (Meyers) Kristofferson.[38] Kristofferson has said that he would like the first three lines of Leonard Cohen's \"Bird on the Wire\" on his tombstone:[39] Like a bird on the wire Like a drunk in a midnight choir I have tried in my way to be free",

Among his songwriting credits are the songs \"Me and Bobby McGee\", \"For the Good Times\", \"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\", and \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\", all of which were hits for other artists. Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with Nashville songwriters such as Shel Silverstein.[1] In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash in forming the country music supergroup The Highwaymen, and formed a key creative force in the outlaw country music movement that eschewed the Nashville music machine in favor of independent songwriting and producing.\nIn 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He is also known for his starring roles in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Heaven's Gate, Blade and A Star Is Born, the last of which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.\nKristoffer Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, to Mary Ann (n\u00e9e Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a U.S. Army Air Corps officer (later a U.S. Air Force major general).[2] His paternal grandparents emigrated from Sweden, while his mother had English, Scots-Irish, German, Swiss-German, and Dutch ancestry. Kristofferson's paternal grandfather was an officer in the Swedish Army. When Kristofferson was a child, his father pushed him towards a military career.[3]\nAt the age of 17, Kristofferson took a summer job with a dredging contractor on Wake Island. He called it \"the hardest job I ever had.\"[4]\nLike most \"military brats\", Kristofferson moved around frequently as a youth, finally settling down in San Mateo, California, where he graduated from San Mateo High School in 1954. An aspiring writer, Kristofferson enrolled in Pomona College that same year. Kris Kristofferson's early writing included essays which won him prizes, and \"The Rock\" and \"Gone Are the Days\" were published in The Atlantic Monthly. These early stories reveal the roots of Kris' passions and concerns. \"The Rock\" is about a geographical feature that resembled the form of a woman. while the latter was about a racial incident.[5]\nHe experienced his first dose of fame in 1958 when he appeared in Sports Illustrated's \"Faces in the Crowd\" on March 31 for his achievements in collegiate Rugby Union, American football, and track and field.[6] He and his classmates revived the Claremont Colleges Rugby Club in 1958, which has remained a Southern California rugby institution. Kristofferson graduated in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, summa cum laude, in literature. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year. In a 2004 interview with Pomona College Magazine, Kristofferson mentioned philosophy professor Frederick Sontag as an important influence in his life.[7]\nKristofferson earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, where he studied at Merton College.[8] While at Oxford, he was awarded his Blue for boxing,[8] played rugby for his college, and began writing songs. At Oxford, he was also acquainted with fellow Rhodes scholar, art critic, and poet  Michael Fried. With the help of his manager, Larry Parnes, Kristofferson recorded for Top Rank Records under the name Kris Carson. Parnes was working to sell Kristofferson as \"a Yank at Oxford\" to the British public; Kristofferson was willing to accept that promotional approach if it helped his singing career, which he hoped would enable him to progress towards his goal of becoming a novelist.[9] This early phase of his music career was unsuccessful.[10]\nIn 1960, Kristofferson graduated with a B.Phil. degree in English literature.[8][11][12] The following year he married his longtime girlfriend, Frances Mavia Beer.[8]\nKristofferson, under pressure from his family, joined the U.S. Army, was commissioned as a second lieutenant and attained the rank of captain. He became a helicopter pilot after receiving flight training at Fort Rucker, Alabama. He also completed Ranger School. During the early-1960s, he was stationed in West Germany as a member of the 8th Infantry Division.[13] During this time, he resumed his music career and formed a band. In 1965, when his tour in Germany ended, Kristofferson was given an assignment to teach English literature at West Point.[14] Instead, he decided to leave the Army and pursue songwriting. His family disowned him because of his career decision, and sources are unclear on whether or not they reconciled.[15][16][17] They saw it as a rejection of everything they stood for, in spite of the fact that Kristofferson has said he is proud of his time in the military, and received the Veteran of the Year Award at the 2003 American Veterans Awards ceremony.[18][19]\nAfter leaving the army in 1965, Kristofferson moved to Nashville. He worked at a variety of odd jobs while struggling for success in music while burdened with medical expenses resulting from his son's defective esophagus. He and his wife soon divorced.\nHe got a job sweeping floors at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville. He met June Carter there and asked her to give Johnny Cash a tape of his. She did, but Cash put it on a large pile with others. He also worked as a commercial helicopter pilot for south Louisiana firm Petroleum Helicopters International (PHI), based in Lafayette, Louisiana. Kristofferson recalled of his days as a pilot, \"That was about the last three years before I started performing, before people started cutting my songs. I would work a week down here [in south Louisiana] for PHI, sitting on an oil platform and flying helicopters. Then I'd go back to Nashville at the end of the week and spend a week up there trying to pitch the songs, then come back down and write songs for another week. I can remember \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" I wrote sitting on top of an oil platform. I wrote \"Bobby McGee\" down here, and a lot of them [in south Louisiana].\"[20]\nWeeks after giving Carter his tapes, Kristofferson landed a helicopter in Cash's front yard, gaining his full attention.[21] A story about Kristofferson having a beer in one hand and some songs in the other upon arrival was reputed, but has been disproven, with Kristofferson saying that, \"It was still kind of an invasion of privacy that I wouldn't recommend. To be honest, I don't think he was there... John had a pretty creative memory\".[22] But upon hearing Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\", Cash decided to record it, and that year Kristofferson won Songwriter of the Year at the Country Music Awards.\nIn 1966, Dave Dudley released a successful Kristofferson single, \"Viet Nam Blues\". In 1967, Kristofferson signed to Epic Records and released a single, \"Golden Idol/Killing Time\", but the song was not successful. Within the next few years, more Kristofferson originals hit the charts, performed by Roy Drusky (\"Jody and the Kid\"); Billy Walker &amp; the Tennessee Walkers (\"From the Bottle to the Bottom\"); Ray Stevens (\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\"); Jerry Lee Lewis (\"Once More with Feeling\"); Faron Young (\"Your Time's Comin'\"); and Roger Miller (\"Me and Bobby McGee\", \"Best of all Possible Worlds\", and \"Darby's Castle\"). He achieved some success as a performer himself, following Johnny Cash's introduction of him at the Newport Folk Festival.\nKristofferson signed with Monument Records as a recording artist. In addition to running that label, Fred Foster also served as manager of Combine Music, Kristofferson's songwriting label. His debut album for Monument in 1970 was Kristofferson, which included a few new songs, as well as many of his previous hits. Sales were poor, although this debut album would become a success the following year when it was re-released under the title Me &amp; Bobby McGee. Kristofferson's compositions were still in demand. Ray Price (\"For the Good Times\"), Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips (\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\"), Waylon Jennings (\"The Taker\"), Bobby Bare (\"Come Sundown\"), Johnny Cash (\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\"), and Sammi Smith (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\") all recorded successful versions of his songs in the early-1970s. \"For the Good Times\" (Ray Price) won \"Song of the Year\" in 1970 from the Academy of Country Music, while \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" (Johnny Cash) won the same award from the Academy's rival, the Country Music Association, in the same year. This is the only time an individual received the same award from these two organizations in the same year for different songs.\nIn 1971, Janis Joplin, who dated Kristofferson for some time until her death, had a number one hit with \"Me and Bobby McGee\" from her posthumous album Pearl. When released, it stayed on the number-one spot on the charts for weeks. More hits followed from others: Ray Price (\"I'd Rather Be Sorry\"); Joe Simon (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\"); Bobby Bare (\"Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends\"); O.C. Smith (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\"); Jerry Lee Lewis (\"Me and Bobby McGee\"); Patti Page (\"I'd Rather Be Sorry\"); and Peggy Little (\"I've Got to Have You\"). Country music performer Kenny Rogers has also recorded some of Kristofferson's compositions, including a version of \"Me and Bobby McGee\" in 1969 with The First Edition for the Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town album.\nKristofferson released his second album, The Silver Tongued Devil and I in 1971. It included \"Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)\". It was a success and established Kristofferson's career as a recording artist in his own right. Soon after, Kristofferson made his acting debut in The Last Movie (directed by Dennis Hopper) and appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival. A portion of his Isle of Wight performance is featured on the three disc compilation,  The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies. In 1971, he acted in Cisco Pike and released his third album, Border Lord. The album was all-new material and sales were sluggish. He also swept the Grammy Awards that year with numerous songs nominated, winning country song of the year for \"Help Me Make It Through the Night.\" Kristofferson's 1972 fourth album, Jesus Was a Capricorn, initially had slow sales, but the third single, \"Why Me,\" was a success and significantly increased album sales. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on November 8, 1973.[23]\nIn 1972, Kristofferson appeared with Rita Coolidge on British TV on BBC's \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\", performing a physically intimate version of \"Help Me Make It Through The Night\".\nFor the next several years, Kristofferson focused on acting. He appeared in Blume in Love (1973) directed by Paul Mazursky, and three Sam Peckinpah films: Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974), and Convoy (1978). He continued acting in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), Vigilante Force (1976), and The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea (film) (1976), the romantic drama A Star Is Born (1976) with Barbra Streisand, for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor soon followed. At the peak of his box office power, Kristofferson turned down William Friedkin's Sorcerer (1977) and the romantic war film Hanover Street (1979). Despite his success with Streisand, Kristofferson's solo musical career headed downward with his non-charting ninth album, Shake Hands with the Devil. His next film, the two-part 1979 NBC-TV movie Freedom Road, did not get good ratings.\nKristofferson was next cast in the lead role as the enigmatic Sheriff James Averill in Michael Cimino's bleak and sprawling 1980 anti-Western Heaven's Gate. Despite being a scandalous studio-bankrupting and industry-changing failure at the time (it cost Kristofferson his Hollywood A-list status), the film gained critical recognition in subsequent years. In 1986, he starred in The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James with Johnny Cash and Flashpoint in 1984, directed by William Tannen.  In 1987, Kristofferson starred in the seven-episode TV series Amerika with Robert Urich and Christine Lahti. In 1989, he was the male lead in the film Millennium with Cheryl Ladd. In 1996, he earned a supporting role as Charlie Wade, a corrupt South Texas sheriff in John Sayles's Lone Star, a film nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay. In 1997, he co-starred in the film Fire Down Below with Steven Seagal.\nIn 1998, he took a role in the film Blade, alongside Wesley Snipes, as Blade's mentor Abraham Whistler. He reprised the role in Blade II (2002) and again in Blade: Trinity (2004). In 1998 he starred in Dance with Me along with Vanessa Williams and Chayanne. In 1999, he co-starred with Mel Gibson in Payback. He was then in the 2001 Tim Burton version of Planet of the Apes. He has also played the title character \"Yohan\" as an old man in the Norwegian film Yohan\u2014the Children Wanderer.  He co-starred in the 2011 film Dolphin Tale and its 2014 sequel, Dolphin Tale 2. In 2012, Kristofferson was in Joyful Noise with longtime friend, Dolly Parton. In 2013, Kristofferson co-starred in The Motel Life, as well as Angels Sing with Willie Nelson and Lyle Lovett. In 2006, Kristofferson starred with Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold in the film Disappearances about whiskey running from Quebec to the US during the Great Depression.\nAfter his singing success in the early-1970s, Kristofferson met singer Rita Coolidge. They married in 1973 and released an album titled Full Moon, another success buoyed by numerous hit singles and Grammy nominations. However, his fifth album, Spooky Lady's Sideshow, released in 1974, was a commercial failure, setting the trend for most of the rest of his musical career. Artists such as Ronnie Milsap and Johnny Duncan continued to record Kristofferson's material with success, but his distinctively rough voice and anti-pop sound kept his own audience to a minimum. Meanwhile, more artists took his songs to the top of the charts, including Willie Nelson, whose 1979 LP release of (Willie Nelson) Sings Kristofferson reached nummber five on the U.S. Country Music chart and certified Platinum in the U.S.\nIn 1979, Kris Kristofferson traveled to Havana, Cuba, to participate in the historic Havana Jam festival that took place on March 2\u20134, alongside Rita Coolidge, Stephen Stills, the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the Trio of Doom, Fania All-Stars, Billy Swan, Bonnie Bramlett, Mike Finnegan, Weather Report, and Billy Joel, plus an array of Cuban artists such as Irakere, Pacho Alonso, Tata G\u00fcines, and Orquesta Arag\u00f3n. His performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary Havana Jam '79.\nOn November 18, 1979, Kristofferson and Coolidge appeared on The Muppet Show, where Kristofferson sang \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" with Miss Piggy, Coolidge sang \"We're All Alone\" with forest animals, and the pair sang \"Song I'd Like to Sing\" with the Muppet monsters.\nIn 1982, Kristofferson participated (with Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, and Brenda Lee) on The Winning Hand, a double album consisting of remastered and updated performances of recordings the four artists had made for the Monument label during the mid-1960s; the album reached the top-ten on the U.S. country album charts. He married again, to Lisa Meyers, and concentrated on films for a time, appearing in The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck, Flashpoint, and Songwriter, the last of which also starred Willie Nelson. Kristofferson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. Music from Songwriter (an album of Nelson-Kristofferson duets) was a massive country success.\nNelson and Kristofferson continued their partnership, and added Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash to form the supergroup The Highwaymen. Their first album, Highwayman, was a success, and the supergroup continued working together for a time. The single from the album, also entitled \"Highwayman\", and especially written for them by Jimmy Webb, was awarded the ACM's single of the year in 1985.[24] In 1985, Kristofferson starred in Trouble in Mind and released Repossessed, a politically aware album that was a country success, particularly \"They Killed Him\" (also performed by Bob Dylan), a tribute to his heroes, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Jesus, and Mahatma Gandhi. Kristofferson also appeared in Amerika at about the same time, a miniseries that attempted to depict life in America under Soviet control.\nIn spite of the success of Highwayman 2 in 1990, Kristofferson's solo recording career slipped significantly in the early-1990s, though he continued to record successfully with the Highwaymen. Lone Star (1996 film by John Sayles) reinvigorated Kristofferson's acting career, and he soon appeared in Blade, Blade II, Blade: Trinity, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, Fire Down Below, Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, Chelsea Walls, Payback, The Jacket, and Fast Food Nation.\nThe Songwriters Hall of Fame inducted Kristofferson in 1985, as had the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame earlier, in 1977. In 1999, The Austin Sessions, was released, an album on which Kristofferson reworked some of his favorite songs with the help of artists such as Mark Knopfler, Steve Earle, and Jackson Browne. In 2003, Broken Freedom Song was released, a live album recorded in San Francisco.\nIn 2003, he received the \"Spirit of Americana\" free speech award from The Americana Music Association.[25] In 2004, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2006, he received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and released his first album full of new material in 11 years; This Old Road. On April 21, 2007, Kristofferson won CMT's Johnny Cash Visionary Award. Rosanne Cash, Cash's daughter, presented the honor during the April 16 awards show in Nashville. Previous recipients include Cash, Hank Williams, Jr., Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire, and the Dixie Chicks. \"John was my hero before he was my friend, and anything with his name on it is really an honor in my eyes,\" Kristofferson said during a phone interview. \"I was thinking back to when I first met him, and if I ever thought that I'd be getting an award with his name on it, it would have carried me through a lot of hard times.\"[26]\nIn July 2007, Kristofferson was featured on CMT's \"Studio 330 Sessions\" where he played many of his hits.\nOn June 13, 2008, Kristofferson performed an acoustic in the round set with Patty Griffin and Randy Owen (Alabama) for a special taping of a PBS songwriters series aired in December. Each performer played five songs. Kristofferson's set included \"The Best of All Possible Worlds\", \"Darby's Castle\", \"Casey's Last Ride\", \"Me and Bobby McGee\", and \"Here Comes that Rainbow Again\". Taping was done in Nashville.\nKristofferson released a new album of original songs entitled Closer to the Bone on September 29, 2009. It is produced by Don Was on the New West label. Prior to the release, Kristofferson remarked: \"I like the intimacy of the new album. It has a general mood of reflecting on where we all are at this time of life.\"[27]\nOn November 10, 2009, Kristofferson was honored as a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI Country Awards. Throughout his career, Kristofferson's songwriting has garnered 48 BMI Country and Pop Awards.[28] He later remarked, \"The great thing about being a songwriter is you can hear your baby interpreted by so many people that have creative talents vocally that I don't have.\"[29] Kristofferson had always denied having a good voice, and has said that as he's aged, what quality it might once have had commenced to decay.[30]\nIn December 2009, it was announced that Kristofferson would be portraying Joe in the upcoming album Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, a collaboration between rock singer John Mellencamp and novelist Stephen King.[31]\nOn May 11, 2010, Light in the Attic Records released demos that were recorded during Kristofferson's janitorial stint at Columbia. Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends: The Publishing Demos is the first time these recordings have been released and includes material that would later be featured on other Kristofferson recordings and on the recordings of other prominent artists, such as the original recording of \"Me and Bobby McGee\".\nOn June 4, 2011, Kristofferson performed a solo acoustic show at the Maui Arts and Cultural Center, showcasing both some of his original hits made famous by other artists, and newer songs.\nIn early-2013, Kristofferson released a new album of original songs called Feeling Mortal. A live album titled An Evening With Kris Kristofferson was released in September 2014.\nKris Kristofferson voiced the character Chief Hanlon of the NCR Rangers in the hit 2010 video game Fallout: New Vegas.\nIn an interview for Las Vegas magazine Q&amp;A by Matt Kelemen on October 23, 2015, he revealed that a new album, The Cedar Creek Sessions, recorded in Austin, would include some old and some new songs.[32] In December 2016, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Americana Album.[33]\nKristofferson covered Brandi Carlile's \"Turpentine\" on the 2017 album Cover Stories.[34]\nKristofferson performed, with assistance from Brandi Carlile, the Joni Mitchell composition A Case of You, from the 1971 Mitchell album Blue, on November 7, 2018 at the Both Sides Now - Joni 75 A Birthday Celebration to celebrate the 75th birthday of Joni Mitchell.[35]\nKristofferson was announced on June 28 as being one of the supporting artists, alongside Bryan Ferry, for a Barbra Streisand \"exclusive European concert\" on July 7, 2019 in London's Hyde Park as part of the Barclay's Summertime Concert series.\nKristofferson married Lisa Meyers in 1983. They own a home in Los Flores Canyon in Malibu, California,[36] and maintain a residence in Hana on the island of Maui.\nKristofferson has encountered a few serious medical issues in the past few decades. He had successful bypass surgery in 1999, but from 2004 to 2015 suffered from what was finally diagnosed as Lyme disease, although it was initially and incorrectly thought to be early onset Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear how Kristofferson contracted Lyme disease but it is suspected that he caught it while filming a movie in the woods of Vermont in 2002. His wife credits the successful diagnosis and recovery to getting second opinions when dealing with auto-immune and Alzheimer-type diagnoses. Kristofferson is currently being treated by a specialist in California \"who added antibiotic intramuscular injections to Kris's protocol and is continuing to treat Kris\", his wife reported.[36][37]\nKristofferson has eight children from three marriages: daughter Tracy (b. 1962) and son Kris (b. 1968) from his first marriage to Fran Beer; \ndaughter Casey (b. 1974) from his second marriage, to Rita Coolidge; and Jesse (b. 1983), Jody (b. 1985), Johnny (b. 1988), Kelly Marie (b. 1990), and Blake (b. 1994) from his marriage to his current wife, Lisa (Meyers) Kristofferson.[38]\nKristofferson has said that he would like the first three lines of Leonard Cohen's \"Bird on the Wire\" on his tombstone:[39]\nLike a bird on the wire\nLike a drunk in a midnight choir\nI have tried in my way to be free\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRobert Barisford Brown (born February 5, 1969)[3] is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, dancer and actor. Brown, alongside frequent collaborator Teddy Riley, is noted as a pioneer of new jack swing; a fusion of hip hop and R&B. Brown started his career in the R&B and pop group New Edition, from its inception in 1981[2] until his exit from the group in December 1985.[4] Starting a solo career, Brown enjoyed commercial and critical success with his second album Don't Be Cruel (1988) which spawned five Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles including the number one hit \"My Prerogative\", and the Grammy Award-winning \"Every Little Step\".[5] In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Ghostbusters II. In 1992, Brown married singer Whitney Houston, with whom he had a daughter named Bobbi Kristina Brown. The couple's drug abuse and domestic disputes made them tabloid fodder.[6] Brown's next album Bobby (1992) spawned several hit singles including \"Humpin' Around\", \"Get Away,\" and \"Good Enough.\" However, sales of Bobby did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood. Brown also starred in films such as A Thin Line Between Love and Hate and Two Can Play That Game. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005. Brown and Houston starred in the 2005 reality show Being Bobby Brown, and divorced two years later in 2007. Brown was born in Boston, Massachusetts,[3] as one of eight children of Carole Elizabeth (born Williams), a substitute teacher, and Herbert James Brown, a construction worker.[7][8] Brown grew up in Roxbury's Orchard Park Projects.[9][10][11] Brown's first taste of being onstage occurred when he was three and one of his childhood idols, James Brown, performed in Boston. This performance sparked a dream of becoming a singer. Brown joined the church choir, where he recognized and developed his singing abilities. Brown's musical influences also include Rick James, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, and Prince.[12] New Edition was founded in 1981 by 12-year-old Brown and childhood friends Michael Bivins and Ricky Bell.[13] Ralph Tresvant joined the group at the suggestion of Bell who sang with Tresvant as a duo. Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew Ronnie DeVoe, to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1982, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian Arthur Baker's Streetwise Records, who released their debut album Candy Girl. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl,\" which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their self-titled second release. The album included the crossover hits \"Cool It Now\" and \"Mr. Telephone Man,\" which Brown also co-led. Despite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.[14] Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition.\" Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a VH-1 Behind the Music documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members\u2014most prominently Tresvant\u2014against the decision. Following his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, MCA (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album King of Stage in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the ballad \"Girlfriend,\" but the album otherwise failed to perform well. Brown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&B producers and songwriters of the time, including Babyface, Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid and Teddy Riley. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, Don't Be Cruel. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100,[5] including the number-one single, the self-penned \"My Prerogative\", which became, along with \"Every Little Step\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step.\"[15] Don't Be Cruel also garnered Brown two American Music Awards, a Soul Train Music Award and a People's Choice Award. In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Ghostbusters II, and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"On Our Own\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, Dance!...Ya Know It!, was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the Don't Be Cruel project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement. In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 MTV Awards, and Brown was set to release the album Mystical Magic, but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day. In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"She Ain't Worth It\" by Glenn Medeiros, making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend Ralph Tresvant on the latter's single \"Stone Cold Gentleman\", which was a top-five R&B hit. Brown's next album Bobby wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era\u2014one that Brown had dominated\u2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"Humpin' Around\", \"Get Away,\" and \"Good Enough.\" He received his second Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance nomination for \"Humpin' Around.\"[15] He received his third American Music Award in January 1993. However, sales of Bobby did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Whitney Houston, and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood. In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"Something in Common,\" which was released as a single from the Bobby album. Four years later he would release his fourth solo album Forever, in 1997. Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful. Prior to the release of Forever, Brown had been in negotiations with rapper Tupac Shakur to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label Death Row East. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following Forever, Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from The Benzino Project, and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper Ja Rule on the song \"Thug Lovin'.\" Brown was signed to Murder Inc. Records, but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to Damian Marley's song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, Welcome to Jamrock. In 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But, written by author Derrick Handspike.[16] When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.[17][16] Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.[18] In 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer Macy Gray on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album The Sellout. About this project, Gray explained to Essence,[19] \"Actually, he came to the studio, since he doesn't live far, and knocked out his recording in two hours. We're friends, and his one-year-old son is my godson. His fianc\u00e9e is one of my best friends in the whole world. I met Bobby a long time ago, but we really got to know each other through her.\"[20] On June 5, 2012, Brown released his fifth album, The Masterpiece, which debuted at number 41 on the Billboard R&B album chart.[5] On February 14, 2017, Brown performed at the Valentine's Day Music Festival with Keith Sweat, Avant and El DeBarge.[21] On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Bobby Brown among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[22] Brown made his first reunited appearance with New Edition at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. Their performance later sparked the recording of Bell Biv DeVoe's \"Word to the Mutha!\" in 1991; on which Brown, Ralph Tresvant and later NE member Johnny Gill were included. A full-fledged reunion occurred with the 1996 release of the album, Home Again.[23] Brown contributed lead vocals on two hit singles, \"Hit Me Off\" and \"You Don't Have to Worry\". However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour. In 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with Bell Biv DeVoe. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the death of the group's idol Michael Jackson, all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of Jackson 5 hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year. As of 2016, Brown and New Edition continue to perform together. Brown made his acting debut with a cameo appearance in the 1989 film, Ghostbusters II, playing the Mayor's doorman. The following year, he appeared in the HBO kids show, Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme playing all three characters of Three Blind Mice. In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, Panther, and had a major role in the Martin Lawrence film, A Thin Line Between Love and Hate. Brown made other guest appearances in the films, Two Can Play That Game, Gang of Roses, Nora's Hair Salon and Go for Broke. In 2005, Brown signed a deal with Bravo to overlook the direction of the reality series, Being Bobby Brown, but it was said[by whom?] that he had to convince producers that his then-wife Whitney Houston would appear on the show. Houston later told Oprah Winfrey that she agreed to do it because she \"loved him\" and \"did whatever he asked because I was his wife.\" The Hollywood Reporter said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\".[24] Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot.[25] The show lasted one season but received bad reviews in the duration of its run, leading to a fallout in both singers' careers; it ended in 2006 after Houston refused to appear in a second season. The couple divorced soon after. In June 2007, Brown took part in the ITV television series \"24 hours with...\", a chat show format as celebrity and interviewer spend an intense 24 hours locked in a room together. The show's host, Jamie Campbell, asked Brown questions about his career and private life, and infamously joked about making \"sexual moves\" towards the singer. Brown was furious and threatened to beat Campbell up live on air.[26] Brown's later tenures in reality shows included appearances on Real Husbands of Hollywood, Celebrity Fit Club and Gone Country. In 1995, Brown was with Steven Sealy when Sealy was targeted in a drive-by shooting. Sealy, Brown's sister's boyfriend, was killed and Brown was unharmed.[27][28] The shooter, John Tibbs, took a plea agreement in 2001.[29] Brown's parents, Carole and Herbert Brown, died within a year of each other, Carole in 2011 and Herbert \"Pops\" in January 2012, a month before his ex-wife Whitney Houston's death.[30][31] Brown claimed to have dated Madonna and Janet Jackson, in addition to sleeping with \"thousands of women.\"[17] Brown first met Whitney Houston at the Soul Train Music Awards in 1989. They began a close friendship after Houston invited 20-year-old Brown to her 26th birthday party in August 1989. Their friendship developed into a romance by 1991. In April 1992, Brown proposed marriage to Houston and the couple married at Houston's estate on July 18, 1992. Their daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was born the following year.[32] Houston and Brown later collaborated on the hit single \"Something in Common\", which included their daughter at the end of the video. Throughout their marriage, Houston and Brown went through periods of infidelity, domestic violence,[33] and drug use. Their personal issues became comedy fodder for talk shows and sketch comedy shows, most notably MadTV, where they were satirized as dysfunctional drug addicts. Aries Spears portrayed Brown as a jealous and volatile has-been who is insecure about his wife's (Debra Wilson) icon status. In 2003, Brown was charged with battery after an altercation with Houston.[33] In 2005, the couple participated in the reality show Being Bobby Brown, which scrutinized their personal life even more thoroughly.[34] In September 2006, Houston filed for legal separation; their divorce was finalized on April 24, 2007, with Houston receiving custody of their 14-year-old daughter.[35][36] In a September 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston admitted to using drugs with Brown, stating that Brown had \"laced marijuana with rock cocaine.\"[37] Houston also told Winfrey that Brown had been emotionally abusive during their marriage and had even spat on her on one occasion.[38] Following the death of Houston on February 11, 2012, six days after his 43rd birthday, he struggled to perform at a New Edition show, shouting \"I love you, Whitney\" in tears.[39] Brown then excused himself from the stage and New Edition finished the remainder of the show. Brown was invited to appear at Houston's memorial service in New Jersey but was asked to leave by Houston's family security. In an interview given to The Today Show in May 2012, Brown said security was the reason he and his family left Houston's service; Brown stated that he loved Houston's family and told Matt Lauer that he had spent \"14 beautiful years\" with Houston as his wife. He also denied rumors that he introduced Houston to drugs.[40] Along with Clive Davis, Ray J, and others, Brown has been accused of contributing to the singer's death.[41] In 2009, Brown had a son Cassius with his partner of two years, manager Alicia Etheredge.[42] Brown and Etheredge became engaged in May 2010, when Brown proposed during a performance at the Funk Fest in Jacksonville, Florida.[43] The couple married in June 2012 in Hawaii and have since added two daughters to their family.[44] Brown has fathered seven children. His eldest child, Landon, was born circa 1986 to Melika Williams.[44][45] With girlfriend Kim Ward, whom he met circa 1980, he had daughter La'Princia[46] (born 1989) and son Bobby Jr. (born c. 1992). Brown and Ward's on-and-off 11-year relationship ended in 1991, after two-months-pregnant Ward found out Brown was engaged to Whitney Houston.[47] His daughter with Houston, Bobbi Kristina Brown, was born on March 4, 1993.[32] Brown has three children with Alicia Etheredge: son Cassius (born May 31, 2009), daughters Bodhi Jameson Rein Brown (born July 9, 2015) and Hendrix Estelle Sheba Brown (born July 21, 2016).[48][49] In January 2015, Brown's daughter Bobbi Kristina was found unconscious in her bathtub at her residence in Roswell, Georgia. The 21-year-old was rushed into North Fulton Hospital where she was placed on a ventilator in a medically-induced coma to stop the swelling of her brain. It was later reported her brain activity was \"low\". Brown rushed to his daughter's side and released a statement to the press requesting them to respect the family's privacy. She was later transferred to Emory University Hospital.[50] After doctors concluded that significant brain function was unlikely to occur, Bobbi Kristina was removed from the ventilator and put in the care of Hospice in Duluth, Georgia. She died there on July 26, 2015 at age 22.[51] As a child, Brown was diagnosed with ADD and was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of thirty-two.[52] Brown said that his drug of choice was marijuana and that he had developed alcoholism at an early age. Brown claimed Houston introduced him to cocaine shortly before their wedding in 1992.[53] \"I never used cocaine until after I met Whitney. Before then, I had experimented with other drugs, but marijuana was my drug of choice,\" he said.[17] Throughout the 1990s his drug addiction worsened and at one point he was cooking cocaine and using heroin.[17] Brown has been arrested multiple times for various violations: 1992",

Brown, alongside frequent collaborator Teddy Riley, is noted as a pioneer of new jack swing; a fusion of hip hop and R&amp;B. Brown started his career in the R&amp;B and pop group New Edition, from its inception in 1981[2] until his exit from the group in December 1985.[4]\nStarting a solo career, Brown enjoyed commercial and critical success with his second album Don't Be Cruel (1988) which spawned five Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles including the number one hit \"My Prerogative\", and the Grammy Award-winning \"Every Little Step\".[5] In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Ghostbusters II. In 1992, Brown married singer Whitney Houston, with whom he had a daughter named Bobbi Kristina Brown. The couple's drug abuse and domestic disputes made them tabloid fodder.[6]\nBrown's next album Bobby (1992) spawned several hit singles including \"Humpin' Around\", \"Get Away,\" and \"Good Enough.\" However, sales of Bobby did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.\nBrown also starred in films such as A Thin Line Between Love and Hate and Two Can Play That Game. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005. Brown and Houston starred in the 2005 reality show Being Bobby Brown, and divorced two years later in 2007.\nBrown was born in Boston, Massachusetts,[3] as one of eight children of Carole Elizabeth (born Williams), a substitute teacher, and Herbert James Brown, a construction worker.[7][8] Brown grew up in Roxbury's Orchard Park Projects.[9][10][11] Brown's first taste of being onstage occurred when he was three and one of his childhood idols, James Brown, performed in Boston. This performance sparked a dream of becoming a singer. Brown joined the church choir, where he recognized and developed his singing abilities. Brown's musical influences also include Rick James, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, and Prince.[12]\nNew Edition was founded in 1981 by 12-year-old Brown and childhood friends Michael Bivins and Ricky Bell.[13] Ralph Tresvant joined the group at the suggestion of Bell who sang with Tresvant as a duo. Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew Ronnie DeVoe, to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1982, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian Arthur Baker's Streetwise Records, who released their debut album Candy Girl. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&amp;B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl,\" which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their self-titled second release. The album included the crossover hits \"Cool It Now\" and \"Mr. Telephone Man,\" which Brown also co-led.\nDespite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.[14] Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition.\" Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a VH-1 Behind the Music documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members\u2014most prominently Tresvant\u2014against the decision.\nFollowing his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, MCA (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album King of Stage in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&amp;B hit with the ballad \"Girlfriend,\" but the album otherwise failed to perform well.\nBrown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&amp;B producers and songwriters of the time, including Babyface, Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid and Teddy Riley. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, Don't Be Cruel. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100,[5] including the number-one single, the self-penned \"My Prerogative\", which became, along with \"Every Little Step\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&amp;B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step.\"[15] Don't Be Cruel also garnered Brown two American Music Awards, a Soul Train Music Award and a People's Choice Award.\nIn 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Ghostbusters II, and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"On Our Own\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, Dance!...Ya Know It!, was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the Don't Be Cruel project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement. In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 MTV Awards, and Brown was set to release the album Mystical Magic, but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day.  In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"She Ain't Worth It\" by Glenn Medeiros, making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend Ralph Tresvant on the latter's single \"Stone Cold Gentleman\", which was a top-five R&amp;B hit.\nBrown's next album Bobby wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era\u2014one that Brown had dominated\u2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"Humpin' Around\", \"Get Away,\" and \"Good Enough.\" He received his second Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance nomination for \"Humpin' Around.\"[15] He received his third American Music Award in January 1993. However, sales of Bobby did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Whitney Houston, and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.  In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"Something in Common,\" which was released as a single from the Bobby album.  Four years later he would release his fourth solo album Forever, in 1997.  Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful.\nPrior to the release of Forever, Brown had been in negotiations with rapper Tupac Shakur to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label Death Row East. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following Forever, Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from The Benzino Project, and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper Ja Rule on the song \"Thug Lovin'.\" Brown was signed to Murder Inc. Records, but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to Damian Marley's song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, Welcome to Jamrock. \nIn 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But, written by author Derrick Handspike.[16] When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.[17][16] Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.[18]\nIn 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer Macy Gray on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album The Sellout. About this project, Gray explained to Essence,[19] \"Actually, he came to the studio, since he doesn't live far, and knocked out his recording in two hours. We're friends, and his one-year-old son is my godson. His fianc\u00e9e is one of my best friends in the whole world. I met Bobby a long time ago, but we really got to know each other through her.\"[20]\nOn June 5, 2012, Brown released his fifth album, The Masterpiece, which debuted at number 41 on the Billboard R&amp;B album chart.[5]\nOn February 14, 2017, Brown performed at the Valentine's Day Music Festival with Keith Sweat, Avant and El DeBarge.[21]\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Bobby Brown among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[22]\nBrown made his first reunited appearance with New Edition at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. Their performance later sparked the recording of Bell Biv DeVoe's \"Word to the Mutha!\" in 1991; on which Brown, Ralph Tresvant and later NE member Johnny Gill were included. A full-fledged reunion occurred with the 1996 release of the album, Home Again.[23] Brown contributed lead vocals on two hit singles, \"Hit Me Off\" and \"You Don't Have to Worry\". However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.\nIn 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with Bell Biv DeVoe. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the death of the group's idol Michael Jackson, all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of Jackson 5 hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year. As of 2016, Brown and New Edition continue to perform together.\nBrown made his acting debut with a cameo appearance in the 1989 film, Ghostbusters II, playing the Mayor's doorman. The following year, he appeared in the HBO kids show, Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme playing all three characters of Three Blind Mice. In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, Panther, and had a major role in the Martin Lawrence film, A Thin Line Between Love and Hate. Brown made other guest appearances in the films, Two Can Play That Game, Gang of Roses, Nora's Hair Salon and Go for Broke.\nIn 2005, Brown signed a deal with Bravo to overlook the direction of the reality series, Being Bobby Brown, but it was said[by whom?] that he had to convince producers that his then-wife Whitney Houston would appear on the show. Houston later told Oprah Winfrey that she agreed to do it because she \"loved him\" and \"did whatever he asked because I was his wife.\" The Hollywood Reporter said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\".[24] Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot.[25] The show lasted one season but received bad reviews in the duration of its run, leading to a fallout in both singers' careers; it ended in 2006 after Houston refused to appear in a second season. The couple divorced soon after.\nIn June 2007, Brown took part in the ITV television series \"24 hours with...\", a chat show format as celebrity and interviewer spend an intense 24 hours locked in a room together. The show's host, Jamie Campbell, asked Brown questions about his career and private life, and infamously joked about making \"sexual moves\" towards the singer. Brown was furious and threatened to beat Campbell up live on air.[26] Brown's later tenures in reality shows included appearances on Real Husbands of Hollywood,  Celebrity Fit Club and Gone Country.\nIn 1995, Brown was with Steven Sealy when Sealy was targeted in a drive-by shooting. Sealy, Brown's sister's boyfriend, was killed and Brown was unharmed.[27][28] The shooter, John Tibbs, took a plea agreement in 2001.[29]\nBrown's parents, Carole and Herbert Brown, died within a year of each other, Carole in 2011 and Herbert \"Pops\" in January 2012, a month before his ex-wife Whitney Houston's death.[30][31]\nBrown claimed to have dated Madonna and Janet Jackson, in addition to sleeping with \"thousands of women.\"[17]\nBrown first met Whitney Houston at the Soul Train Music Awards in 1989. They began a close friendship after Houston invited 20-year-old Brown to her 26th birthday party in August 1989. Their friendship developed into a romance by 1991. In April 1992, Brown proposed marriage to Houston and the couple married at Houston's estate on July 18, 1992. Their daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was born the following year.[32] Houston and Brown later collaborated on the hit single \"Something in Common\", which included their daughter at the end of the video.\nThroughout their marriage, Houston and Brown went through periods of infidelity, domestic violence,[33] and drug use. Their personal issues became comedy fodder for talk shows and sketch comedy shows, most notably MadTV, where they were satirized as dysfunctional drug addicts. Aries Spears portrayed Brown as a jealous and volatile has-been who is insecure about his wife's (Debra Wilson) icon status. In 2003, Brown was charged with battery after an altercation with Houston.[33] In 2005, the couple participated in the reality show Being Bobby Brown, which scrutinized their personal life even more thoroughly.[34] In September 2006, Houston filed for legal separation; their divorce was finalized on April 24, 2007, with Houston receiving custody of their 14-year-old daughter.[35][36] In a September 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston admitted to using drugs with Brown, stating that Brown had \"laced marijuana with rock cocaine.\"[37] Houston also told Winfrey that Brown had been emotionally abusive during their marriage and had even spat on her on one occasion.[38]\nFollowing the death of Houston on February 11, 2012, six days after his 43rd birthday, he struggled to perform at a New Edition show, shouting \"I love you, Whitney\" in tears.[39] Brown then excused himself from the stage and New Edition finished the remainder of the show. Brown was invited to appear at Houston's memorial service in New Jersey but was asked to leave by Houston's family security. In an interview given to The Today Show in May 2012, Brown said security was the reason he and his family left Houston's service;  Brown stated that he loved Houston's family and told Matt Lauer that he had spent \"14 beautiful years\" with Houston as his wife. He also denied rumors that he introduced Houston to drugs.[40] Along with Clive Davis, Ray J, and others, Brown has been accused of contributing to the singer's death.[41]\nIn 2009, Brown had a son Cassius with his partner of two years, manager Alicia Etheredge.[42] Brown and Etheredge became engaged in May 2010, when Brown proposed during a performance at the Funk Fest in Jacksonville, Florida.[43] The couple married in June 2012 in Hawaii and have since added two daughters to their family.[44]\nBrown has fathered seven children. His eldest child, Landon, was born circa 1986 to Melika Williams.[44][45] With girlfriend Kim Ward, whom he met circa 1980, he had daughter La'Princia[46] (born 1989) and son Bobby Jr. (born c. 1992). Brown and Ward's on-and-off 11-year relationship ended in 1991, after two-months-pregnant Ward found out Brown was engaged to Whitney Houston.[47] His daughter with Houston, Bobbi Kristina Brown, was born on March 4, 1993.[32] Brown has three children with Alicia Etheredge: son Cassius (born May 31, 2009), daughters Bodhi Jameson Rein Brown (born July 9, 2015) and Hendrix Estelle Sheba Brown (born July 21, 2016).[48][49]\nIn January 2015, Brown's daughter Bobbi Kristina was found unconscious in her bathtub at her residence in Roswell, Georgia. The 21-year-old was rushed into North Fulton Hospital where she was placed on a ventilator in a medically-induced coma to stop the swelling of her brain. It was later reported her brain activity was \"low\". Brown rushed to his daughter's side and released a statement to the press requesting them to respect the family's privacy. She was later transferred to Emory University Hospital.[50] After doctors concluded that significant brain function was unlikely to occur, Bobbi Kristina was removed from the ventilator and put in the care of Hospice in Duluth, Georgia. She died there on July 26, 2015 at age 22.[51]\nAs a child, Brown was diagnosed with ADD and was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of thirty-two.[52] Brown said that his drug of choice was marijuana and that he had developed alcoholism at an early age. Brown claimed Houston introduced him to cocaine shortly before their wedding in 1992.[53] \"I never used cocaine until after I met Whitney. Before then, I had experimented with other drugs, but marijuana was my drug of choice,\" he said.[17] Throughout the 1990s his drug addiction worsened and at one point he was cooking cocaine and using heroin.[17]\nBrown has been arrested multiple times for various violations:\n1992\n</body></html>"

After embarking on a music career in the 1960s, he moved to Los Angeles, where he formed Buffalo Springfield with Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and others. Young released two solo albums and three as a member of Buffalo Springfield by the time he joined Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1969. From his early solo albums and those with his backing band Crazy Horse, Young has recorded a steady stream of studio and live albums, sometimes warring with his recording company along the way. Young has received several Grammy and Juno awards. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him twice: as a solo artist in 1995 and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.[5] In 2000, Rolling Stone named Young the 34th greatest rock 'n roll artist. His guitar work, deeply personal lyrics[6][7][8] and signature tenor singing voice[9][10] define his long career. He also plays piano and harmonica on many albums, which frequently combine folk, rock, country and other musical styles. His often distorted electric guitar playing, especially with Crazy Horse, earned him the nickname \"Godfather of Grunge\"[11] and led to his 1995 album Mirror Ball with Pearl Jam. More recently he has been backed by Promise of the Real. Young directed (or co-directed) films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (2008). He also contributed to the soundtracks of the films Philadelphia (1993) and Dead Man (1995). Young has lived in California since the 1960s but retains Canadian citizenship.[12] He was awarded the Order of Manitoba on July 14, 2006,[4] and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 30, 2009.[3] He became a United States citizen, taking dual citizenship[13][14] on January 22, 2020.[15] Neil Young[16] was born on November 12, 1945, in Toronto, Ontario.[17][18] His father, Scott Alexander Young (1918\u20132005), was a journalist and sportswriter who also wrote fiction.[19] His mother, Edna Blow Ragland \"Rassy\" Young (1918\u20131990) was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.[20] Although Canadian, his mother had American and French ancestry.[21] Young's parents married in 1940 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and their first son, Robert \"Bob\" Young, was born in 1942. Shortly after Young's birth in 1945, his family moved to rural Omemee, Ontario, which Young later described fondly as a \"sleepy little place\".[22] Young suffered from polio in 1951 during the last major outbreak of the disease in Ontario[23] (the Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, then aged nine, also contracted the virus during this epidemic).[24] After his recovery, the Young family vacationed in Florida. During that period, Young briefly attended Faulkner Elementary School in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. In 1952, upon returning to Canada, Young moved from Omemee to Winnipeg for a year, before relocating to Toronto and Pickering. Young became interested in popular music he heard on the radio.[25] When Young was twelve, his father, who had had several extramarital affairs, left his mother. His mother asked for a divorce, which was granted in 1960.[26] Young went to live with his mother, who moved back to Winnipeg, while his brother Bob stayed with his father in Toronto.[27] \u2014 Comrie Smith, Young's teenage friend[28] During the mid-1950s, Young listened to rock 'n roll, rockabilly, doo-wop, R&B, country, and western pop. He idolized Elvis Presley and later referred to him in a number of his songs.[29] Other early musical influences included Link Wray,[30] Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs, The Ventures, Cliff Richard and the Shadows,[31] Chuck Berry, Hank Marvin, Little Richard, Fats Domino, The Chantels, The Monotones, Ronnie Self, the Fleetwoods, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Gogi Grant.[32] Young first began to play music himself on a plastic ukulele, before, as he would later relate, going on to \"a better ukulele to a banjo ukulele to a baritone ukulele \u2013 everything but a guitar.\"[33] Young and his mother settled into the working-class area of Fort Rouge, Winnipeg, where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band, the Jades, and met Ken Koblun. While attending Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands, eventually dropping out of school in favour of a musical career.[34] Young's first stable band was the Squires, with Ken Koblun, Jeff Wuckert and Bill Edmondson on drums, who had a local hit called \"The Sultan\". The band played in Fort William (now part of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer, Ray Dee, who Young called \"the original Briggs\".[35] While playing at The Flamingo, Young met Stephen Stills, whose band the Company were playing the same venue, and they became friends.[36] The Squires played in several dance halls and clubs in Winnipeg and Ontario.[37] After leaving the Squires, Young worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met Joni Mitchell.[38] Mitchell recalls Young as having been highly influenced by Bob Dylan at the time.[39] Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as \"Sugar Mountain\", about lost youth. Mitchell wrote \"The Circle Game\" in response.[40] The Winnipeg band The Guess Who (with Randy Bachman as lead guitarist) had a Canadian Top 40 hit with Young's \"Flying on the Ground is Wrong\", which was Young's first major success as a songwriter.[41] In 1965, Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, while in Toronto, he joined the Rick James-fronted Mynah Birds. The band managed to secure a record deal with the Motown label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being AWOL from the Navy Reserve.[42] After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and the bass player Bruce Palmer decided to pawn the group's musical equipment and buy a Pontiac hearse, which they used to relocate to Los Angeles.[43] Young admitted in a 2009 interview that he was in the United States illegally until he received a \"green card\" (permanent residency permit) in 1970.[44] Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay after a chance encounter in traffic on Sunset Boulevard.[43] Along with Dewey Martin, they formed Buffalo Springfield. A mixture of folk, country, psychedelia, and rock, lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young, made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record Buffalo Springfield (1966) sold well after Stills' topical song \"For What It's Worth\" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar. According to Rolling Stone, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and other sources, Buffalo Springfield helped create the genres of folk rock and country rock.[45] Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, worsened the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album, Buffalo Springfield Again, was released in late 1967, but two of Young's three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group. From that album, \"Mr. Soul\" was the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group performed together. \"Broken Arrow\" features snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a soundbite of Dewey Martin singing \"Mr. Soul\" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. \"Expecting to Fly\" featured a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track, Jack Nitzsche, dubbed \"symphonic pop\".[citation needed] In May 1968, the band split up for good, but to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final studio album, Last Time Around, was released. The album was primarily composed of recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs \"On the Way Home\" and \"I Am a Child\", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony. The three surviving members, Furay, Stills, and Young, appeared together as Buffalo Springfield at Young's annual Bridge School Benefit on October 23\u201324, 2010, and at Bonnaroo in the summer of 2011. Young also played as a studio session guitarist for some 1968 recordings by The Monkees which appeared on the Head and Instant Replay albums.[46] After the break-up of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with Reprise Records, home of his colleague and friend Joni Mitchell, with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who managed Young until his death in 2019. Young and Roberts immediately began work on Young's first solo record, Neil Young (January 22, 1969),[47] which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview,[48] Young deprecated the album as being \"overdubbed rather than played.\" The album contains songs that remain a staple of his live shows including \"The Loner.\" For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets: Danny Whitten on guitar, Billy Talbot on bass guitar, and Ralph Molina on drums. These three took the name Crazy Horse (after the historical figure of the same name), and Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (May 1969), is credited to \"Neil Young with Crazy Horse.\" Recorded in just two weeks, the album includes \"Cinnamon Girl\", \"Cowgirl in the Sand\", and \"Down by the River.\" Young reportedly wrote all three songs in bed on the same day while nursing a high fever of 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C).[49] Shortly after the release of Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining Crosby, Stills & Nash, who had already released one album Crosby, Stills & Nash as a trio in May 1969. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group \u2013 winners of the 1969 \"Best New Artist\" Grammy Award \u2013 was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.[50] The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous Woodstock Festival, during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: \"One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar\".[51] During the making of their first album, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he \"wanted to play folk music in a rock band.\"[52] Despite the tension, Young's tenure with CSN&Y coincided with the band's most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist. Young wrote \"Ohio\" following the Kent State massacre on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSN&Y and immediately released as a single, even though CSN&Y's \"Teach Your Children\" was still climbing the singles charts. Later in the year, Young released his third solo album, After the Gold Rush (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, Nils Lofgren, Stephen Stills, and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, with a wider range of sounds. Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Don't Let It Bring You Down\", the country-influenced singles \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and \"When You Dance I Can Really Love\", and the title track, \"After the Gold Rush\", played on piano, with dream-like lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns. Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"Southern Man\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting Lynyrd Skynyrd to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man Ronnie Van Zant was later photographed wearing a Tonight's the Night T-shirt on the cover of an album. In the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like \"Journey through the Past\", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like \"See the Sky About to Rain\", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young's tour, now entitled \"Journey Through the Past\", continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at Carnegie Hall and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto's Massey Hall, which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young's Archive series. Near the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the Johnny Cash TV show. \"The Needle and the Damage Done\", a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction, had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who eventually died while battling his drug problems.[53][54] While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of Quadrafonic Sound Studios owner Elliot Mazer to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them The Stray Gators, and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals. Against the advice of his producer David Briggs, he scrapped plans for the imminent release[55] of the live acoustic recording in favour of a studio album consisting of the Nashville sessions, electric-guitar oriented sessions recorded later in his barn, and two recordings made with the London Symphony Orchestra at Barking (credited as Barking Town Hall and now the Broadway Theatre) during March 1971.[56] The result was Young's fourth album, Harvest (February 14, 1972). The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album's live acoustic performance of \"Needle and the Damage Done.\" After his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California (\"Broken Arrow Ranch\", where he lived until his divorce in 2014.[57]). He wrote the song \"Old Man\" in honor of the land's longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song \"A Man Needs a Maid\" was inspired by his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress. \"Heart of Gold\" was released as the first single from Harvest, the only No.\u00a01 hit in his career. \"Old Man\" was also popular. The album's recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the Decade (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described \"Heart of Gold\" as the song that \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\" Although a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of Harvest, it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent alcohol/diazepam overdose. Young described the incident to Rolling Stone's Cameron Crowe in 1975:[58] \"[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd OD'd. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.\" On the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer Kenny Buttrey, a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the hard rock milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer Johnny Barbata, while David Crosby and Graham Nash contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, Time Fades Away (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as \"[his] least favorite record\", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's Official Release Series). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. Time Fades Away, for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. Time was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the \"Ditch Trilogy\", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of Harvest (1972).[59] These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time. In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar and piano and Harvest/Time Fades Away veteran Ben Keith on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry, Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, Tonight's the Night (June 20, 1975). The album's dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so.[60] While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, On the Beach (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song \"See the Sky About to Rain\", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like Time Fades Away, it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young's most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of On the Beach described the music as \"mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary\".[61] After completing On the Beach, Young reunited with Harvest producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, Homegrown. Most of the songs were written after Young's break-up with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though Homegrown was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, Tonight's the Night, at the suggestion of Band bassist Rick Danko.[62] Young further explained his move by saying: \"It was a little too personal ... it scared me\".[62] Most of the songs from Homegrown were later incorporated into other Young albums, but the original album never surfaced. Tonight's the Night when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the \"ditch\" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.[63] Young reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour which was recorded and released in 2014 as CSNY 1974. It was one of the first ever stadium tours, and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.[64] In 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with Frank Sampedro on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, Zuma (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; \"Cortez the Killer\", a retelling of the Spanish conquest of Mexico from the viewpoint of the Aztecs, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. Zuma's closing track, \"Through My Sails\", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album. In 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album Long May You Run (September 20, 1976), credited to The Stills-Young Band; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a telegram that read: \"Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil.\"[65] In 1976, Young performed with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and numerous other rock musicians in the high-profile all-star concert The Last Waltz, the final performance by The Band. The release of Martin Scorsese's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of \"Helpless\".[66] American Stars 'n Bars (June 13, 1977) contained two songs originally recorded for the Homegrown album, \"Homegrown\" and \"Star of Bethlehem\", as well as newer material, including the future concert staple \"Like a Hurricane\". Performers on the record included Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and Young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nicolette Larson along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation Decade, a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits. Comes a Time (October 2, 1978), Young's first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, also featured Larson and Crazy Horse. The album became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time and marked a return to his folk roots, including a cover of Ian Tyson's \"Four Strong Winds\", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada. Another of the album's songs, \"Lotta Love\", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979. In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young's film Human Highway, which took its name from a song featured on Comes a Time. Over four years, Young would spend $3,000,000 of his own money on production (US$11,759,694 in 2019 dollars[67]). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the post-punk band Devo, whose members appeared in the film.[68] Young set out in 1978 on the lengthy \"Rust Never Sleeps\" tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an aggressive style of playing, were later seen as a response to punk rock.[citation needed] Two new songs, the acoustic \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\" and electric \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" were the centerpiece of the new material. Their lyrics have been among Young's most widely quoted.[citation needed] The album has also widely been considered a precursor of grunge music and many grunge artists have said they were inspired by Young's distorted guitars on the B side to this album. Young also compared the rise of Johnny Rotten with that of the recently deceased \"King\" Elvis Presley, who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an icon. Rotten returned the favour by playing one of Young's songs, \"Revolution Blues\" from On the Beach, on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians.[69] Young's two accompanying albums Rust Never Sleeps (July 2, 1979; new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and Live Rust (November 19, 1979) (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called Rust Never Sleeps (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\". Young worked with rock artist Jim Evans to create the poster art for the film, using the Star Wars Jawas as a theme. Young's work since Harvest (1972) had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of Rolling Stone voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected Rust Never Sleeps as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well. The Village Voice named Rust Never Sleeps as the year's winner in the Pazz & Jop Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade. The Warner Music Vision release on VHS of Rust Never Sleeps in 1987 had a running time of 116 minutes, and although fully manufactured in Germany, was initially imported from there by the markets throughout Europe. At the start of the decade, distracted by medical concerns relating to the cerebral palsy of his son, Ben, Young had little time to spend on writing and recording.[70] After providing the incidental music to a 1980 biographical film of Hunter S. Thompson entitled Where the Buffalo Roam, Young released Hawks & Doves (November 3, 1980)', a short record pieced together from sessions going back to 1974.[70] 1981's Re\u00b7ac\u00b7tor, an electric album recorded with Crazy Horse, also included material from the 1970s.[71] Young did not tour in support of either album; in total, he played only one show, a set at the 1980 Bread and Roses Festival in Berkeley,[72] between the end of his 1978 tour with Crazy Horse and the start of his tour with the Trans Band in mid-1982.[citation needed] \u2014 Neil Young[73] The 1982 album Trans, which incorporated vocoders, synthesizers, and electronic beats, was Young's first for the new label Geffen Records (distributed at the time by Warner Bros. Records, whose parent Warner Music Group owns most of Young's solo and band catalogue) and represented a distinct stylistic departure. Young later revealed that an inspiration for the album was the theme of technology and communication with his son Ben, who has severe cerebral palsy and cannot speak.[74] An extensive tour preceded the release of the album, and was documented by the video Neil Young in Berlin, which saw release in 1986. MTV played the video for \"Sample and Hold\" in light rotation. The entire song contained \"robot vocals\" by Young and Nils Lofgren.[citation needed]. The song \"After Berlin\" as seen in that video, was the only time Neil Young has ever performed the song. Young's next album, 1983's Everybody's Rockin', included several rockabilly covers and clocked in at less than twenty-five minutes in length. Young was backed by the Shocking Pinks for the supporting US tour. Trans (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head David Geffen for its lack of commercial appeal, and with Everybody's Rockin' following only seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music \"unrepresentative\" of himself.[75] The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos \u2013 Tim Pope directed the videos for \"Wonderin'\" and \"Cry, Cry, Cry\". Also premiered in 1983, though little seen, was Human Highway. Co-directed and co-written by Young, the long-gestating eclectic comedy starred Young, Dean Stockwell, Russ Tamblyn, Dennis Hopper, David Blue, Sally Kirkland, Charlotte Stewart and members of Devo.[citation needed] The first year without a Neil Young album since the start of Young's musical career with Buffalo Springfield in 1966 was in 1984. Young's lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1982 country album Old Ways.[76] It was also the year when Young's third child was born, a girl named Amber Jean. Later diagnosed with inherited epilepsy, Amber Jean was Neil and Pegi's second child together.[citation needed] Young spent most of 1984 and all of 1985 touring for Old Ways (August 12, 1985) with his country band, the International Harvesters. The album was finally released in an altered form midway through 1985. Young also appeared at that year's Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, collaborating with Crosby, Stills and Nash for the quartet's first performance for a paying audience in over ten years.[citation needed] Young's last two albums for Geffen were more conventional in the genre, although they incorporated production techniques like synthesizers and echoing drums that were previously uncommon in Young's music. Young recorded 1986's Landing on Water without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, Life, which emerged in 1987. Young's album sales dwindled steadily throughout the eighties; today Life remains his all-time-least successful studio album, with an estimated four hundred thousand sales worldwide.[77] Switching back to his old label Reprise Records, Young continued to tour relentlessly, assembling a new blues band called The Bluenotes in mid-1987 (a legal dispute with musician Harold Melvin forced the eventual rechristening of the band as Ten Men Working midway through the tour). The addition of a brass section provided a new jazzier sound, and the title track of 1988's This Note's For You became Young's first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and Michael Jackson, the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, \"What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?\" Despite this, the video was eventually named best video of the year by the network in 1989.[78] By comparison, the major music cable network of Young's home nation, Muchmusic, ran the video immediately.[citation needed] Young reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album American Dream and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour. The album was only the second-ever studio record for the quartet.[citation needed] Young's 1989 single \"Rockin' in the Free World\", which hit No.\u00a02 on the US mainstream-rock charts, and accompanying the album, Freedom, rocketed him back into the popular consciousness after a decade of sometimes-difficult genre experiments. The album's lyrics were often overtly political; \"Rockin' in the Free World\" deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President George H.W. Bush.[79] The use of heavy feedback and distortion on several Freedom tracks was reminiscent of the Rust Never Sleeps (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of grunge. The rising stars of the genre, including Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, frequently cited Young as a major influence, contributing to his popular revival. A tribute album called The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young was released in 1989, featuring covers by alternative and grunge acts including Sonic Youth, Nick Cave, Soul Asylum, Dinosaur Jr, and the Pixies. Young's 1990 album Ragged Glory, recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his Northern California ranch, continued this distortion-heavy esthetic. Young toured for the album with Orange County, California country-punk band Social Distortion and alternative rock pioneers Sonic Youth as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans.[80] Weld, a two-disc live album documenting the tour, was released in 1991.[80] Sonic Youth's influence was most evident on Arc, a 35-minute collage of feedback and distortion spliced together at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and originally packaged with some versions of Weld.[80] 1992's Harvest Moon marked an abrupt return to the country and folk-rock stylings of Harvest (1972) and reunited him with some of the musicians from that album, including singers Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor. The title track was a minor hit and the record was well received by critics, winning the Juno Award for Album of the Year in 1994. Young also contributed to Randy Bachman's nostalgic 1992 tune \"Prairie Town\", and garnered a 1993 Academy Award nomination for his song \"Philadelphia\", from the soundtrack of the Jonathan Demme movie of the same name. An MTV Unplugged performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with Booker T. and the M.G.s for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with Blues Traveler, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of \"Rockin' in the Free World\" played with Pearl Jam, foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later. In 1994 Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for Sleeps with Angels, a record whose dark, somber mood was influenced by Kurt Cobain's death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain's life and death, without mentioning him by name. Cobain had quoted Young's lyric \"It's better to burn out than fade away\" (a line from \"My My, Hey Hey\") in his suicide note. Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to his death.[81] Young and Pearl Jam performed \"Act of Love\" at an abortion rights benefit along with Crazy Horse, and were present at a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner, sparking interest in a collaboration between the two.[82] Still enamored with the grunge scene, Young reconnected with Pearl Jam in 1995 for the live-in-the-studio album Mirror Ball and a tour of Europe with the band and producer Brendan O'Brien backing Young. 1995 also marked Young's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where he was inducted by Eddie Vedder. Young has consistently demonstrated the unbridled passion of an artist who understands that self-renewal is the only way to avoid burning out. For this reason, he has remained one of the most significant artists of the rock and roll era. In 1995, Young and his manager Elliot Roberts founded a record label, Vapor Records.[85] It has released recordings by Tegan and Sara, Spoon, Jonathan Richman, Vic Chesnutt, Everest, Pegi Young, Jets Overhead, and Young himself, among others.[85] Young's next collaborative partner was filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, who asked Young to compose a soundtrack to his 1995 black and white western film Dead Man. Young's instrumental soundtrack was improvised while he watched the film alone in a studio. The death of longtime mentor, friend, and producer David Briggs in late 1995 prompted Young to reconnect with Crazy Horse the following year for the album and tour Broken Arrow. A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, Year of the Horse, emerged in 1997. From 1996\u201397 Young and Crazy Horse toured extensively throughout Europe and North America, including a stint as part of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival's sixth annual tour. In 1998, Young renewed his collaboration with the rock band Phish, sharing the stage at the annual Farm Aid concert and then at Young's Bridge School Benefit, where he joined headliners Phish for renditions of \"Helpless\" and \"I Shall Be Released\".[86] Phish declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on his 1999 North American tour. The decade ended with the release in late 1999 of Looking Forward, another reunion with Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet earned US$42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000. Neil Young continued to release new material at a rapid pace through the first decade of the new millennium. The studio album Silver & Gold and live album Road Rock Vol. 1 were released in 2000 and were both accompanied by live concert films. His 2001 single \"Let's Roll\" was a tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks, and the effective action taken by the passengers and crew on Flight 93 in particular.[87] At the \"America: A Tribute to Heroes\" benefit concert for the victims of the attacks, Young performed John Lennon's \"Imagine\" and accompanied Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready on \"Long Road\", a Pearl Jam song that was written with Young during the Mirrorball sessions. \"Let's Roll\" was included on 2002's Are You Passionate?, an album mostly composed of mellow love songs dedicated to Young's wife, Pegi, backed by Booker T. & the M.G.s.[citation needed] In 2003, Young released Greendale, a concept album recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. The songs loosely revolved around the murder of a police officer in a small town in California and its effects on the town's inhabitants.[88] Under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\", Young directed an accompanying film of the same name, featuring actors lip-synching to the music from the album. He toured extensively with the Greendale material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America, Japan, and Australia. Young began using biodiesel on the 2004 Greendale tour, powering his trucks and tour buses with the fuel. \"Our Greendale tour is now ozone friendly\", he said. \"I plan to continue to use this government approved and regulated fuel exclusively from now on to prove that it is possible to deliver the goods anywhere in North America without using foreign oil, while being environmentally responsible.\"[89] Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.[citation needed] In March 2005, while working on the Prairie Wind album in Nashville, Young was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. He was treated successfully with a minimally invasive neuroradiological procedure, performed in a New York hospital on March 29,[90] but two days afterwards he passed out on a New York street from bleeding from the femoral artery, which radiologists had used to access the aneurysm.[91] The complication forced Young to cancel his scheduled appearance at the Juno Awards telecast in Winnipeg, but within months he was back on stage, appearing at the close of the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario, on July 2. During the performance, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called \"When God Made Me\". Young's brush with death influenced Prairie Wind's themes of retrospection and mortality.[92] The album's live premiere in Nashville was recorded by filmmaker Jonathan Demme in the 2006 film Neil Young: Heart of Gold.[citation needed] Young's renewed activism manifested itself in the 2006 album Living with War, which like the much earlier song \"Ohio\", was recorded and released in less than a month as a direct result of current events.[93] In early 2006, three years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the sectarian war and casualties there were escalating. While doing errands on a visit to his daughter, Young had seen a newspaper photo of wounded U.S. veterans on a transport plane to Germany, and noticing that the same paper devoted little actual coverage to the story, he was unable to get the image out of his head, realizing the suffering caused to families by the war had not truly registered to him and most Americans who were not directly affected by it. Young cried, and immediately got his guitar out and began to write multiple songs at once. Within a few days he had completed work and assembled a band. He later said he had restrained himself for a long time from writing any protest songs, waiting for someone younger, with a different perspective, but no one seemed to be saying anything.[citation needed] Most of the album's songs rebuked the Bush administration's policy of war by examining its human costs to soldiers, their loved ones, and civilians, but Young also included a few songs on other themes, and an outright protest titled, \"Let's Impeach the President\",[94] in which he stated that Bush had lied to lead the country into war. Young's lyrics in another song named Illinois Senator Barack Obama, who had not declared any intention to run for president at the time and was widely unexpected to be able to win either the Democratic Party nomination or a general election, as potentially a replacement for Bush. That summer, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young reunited for the supporting \"Freedom of Speech Tour '06\", in which they played Young's new protest songs alongside the group's older material, meeting with both enthusiasm and anger from different fans, some of whom were supportive of Bush politically. CSNY D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, a concert film of the tour directed by Young himself, was released in 2008, along with an accompanying live album.[citation needed] While Young had never been a stranger to eco-friendly lyrics, themes of environmentalist spirituality and activism became increasingly prominent in his work throughout the 1990s and 2000s, especially on Greendale (2003)[95] and Living with War (2006).[96] The trend continued on 2007's Chrome Dreams II, with lyrics exploring Young's personal eco-spirituality.[97] Also in 2007, Young accepted an invitation to participate in Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino, contributing his version of \"Walking to New Orleans\".[citation needed] Young remains on the board of directors of Farm Aid, an organization he co-founded with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp in 1985. According to its website, it is the longest running concert benefit series in the U.S. and it has raised $43 million since its first benefit concert in 1985. Each year, Young co-hosts and performs with well-known guest performers who include Dave Matthews and producers who include Evelyn Shriver and Mark Rothbaum, at the Farm Aid annual benefit concerts to raise funds and provide grants to family farms and prevent foreclosures, provide a crisis hotline, and create and promote home grown farm food in the United States.[98] In 2008, Young revealed his latest project, the production of a hybrid-engine 1959 Lincoln called LincVolt.[99] A new album loosely based on the Lincvolt project, Fork in the Road, was released on April 7, 2009.[100] The album, partly composed of love songs to the car, also commented on the economic crisis, with one narrator attacking the Wall Street bailouts enacted in late 2008. Unfortunately, the car caught fire in November 2010, in a California warehouse, and along the way it burned an estimated US$850,000 worth of Young's rock and roll memorabilia collection. Initial reports suggest the fire might have been triggered by an error in the vehicle's plug-in charging system. Young blamed the fire on human error and said he and his team were committed to rebuilding the car. \"The wall charging system was not completely tested and had never been left unattended. A mistake was made. It was not the fault of the car\", he said.[citation needed] A Jonathan Demme concert film from a 2007 concert at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, called the Neil Young Trunk Show premiered on March 21, 2009, at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival in Austin, Texas. It was featured at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2009 and was released in the U.S. on March 19, 2010[101] to critical acclaim.[102][103][104] Young's guested on the album Potato Hole, released on April 21, 2009 by Memphis organ player Booker T. Jones, of Booker T. & the MGs fame. Young plays guitar on nine of the album's ten instrumental tracks, alongside Drive-By Truckers, who already had three guitar players, giving some songs on the album a total of five guitar tracks. Jones contributed guitars on a couple of tracks.[citation needed] In 2009, Young headlined the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, England,[105] at Hard Rock Calling in London (where he was joined onstage by Paul McCartney for a rendition of \"A Day in the Life\") and, after years of unsuccessful booking attempts, the Isle of Wight Festival[106] in addition to performances at the Big Day Out festival in New Zealand and Australia and the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona.[citation needed] Young has been a vocal opponent of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas. When discussing the environmental impact on the oilsands of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Young asserted that the area now resembles the Japanese city of Hiroshima in the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack of World War II.[107] Young has referred to issues surrounding the proposed use of oil pipelines as \"scabs on our lives\".[107] In an effort to become more involved, Young has worked directly with the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to draw attention to this issue, performing benefit concerts and speaking publicly on the subject. In 2014, he played four shows in Canada dedicated to the Honor the Treaties[108] movement, raising money for the Athabasca Chipewyan legal defence fund.[109] In 2015, he and Willie Nelson held a festival in Neligh, Nebraska, called Harvest the Hope, raising awareness of the impact of tar sands and oil pipelines on Native Americans and family farmers. Both received honours from leaders of the Rosebud, Oglala Lakota, Ponca and Omaha nations, and were invested with sacred buffalo robes.[110] Young participated in the Blue Dot Tour, which was organized and fronted by environmental activist David Suzuki, and toured all 10 Canadian provinces alongside other Canadian artists including the Barenaked Ladies, Feist, and Robert Bateman. The intent of Young's participation in this tour was to raise awareness of the environmental damage caused by the exploitation of tar sands. Young has argued that the amount of CO2 released as a byproduct of tar-sand oil extraction is equivalent to the amount released by the total number of cars in Canada each day.[111] Young has faced criticism by representatives from within the Canadian petroleum industry, who have argued that his statements are irresponsible.[107] Young's opposition to the construction of oil pipelines has influenced his music as well. His song, \"Who's Going to Stand Up?\" was written to protest this issue, and features the lyric \"Ban fossil fuel and draw the line / Before we build one more pipeline\".[107] In addition to directly criticizing members of the oil industry, Young has also focused blame on the actions of the Canadian government for ignoring the environmental impacts of climate change. He referred to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper as \"an embarrassment to many Canadians ...[and] a very poor imitation of the George Bush administration in the United States\".[111] Young has also been critical of Barack Obama's government for failing to uphold the promises made regarding environmental policies during his election campaign.[111] Young recorded \"A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop\" in response to Starbucks' possible involvement with Monsanto and use of genetically-modified food.[112][113] The song was included on his concept album called The Monsanto Years.[114] On January 22, 2010, Young performed \"Long May You Run\" on the final episode of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. On the same night, he and Dave Matthews performed the Hank Williams song \"Alone and Forsaken\", for the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief charity telethon, in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Young also performed \"Long May You Run\" at the closing ceremony of the 2010 Olympic winter games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In May 2010, it was revealed Young had begun working on a new studio album produced by Daniel Lanois. This was announced by David Crosby, who said that the album \"will be a very heartfelt record. I expect it will be a very special record.\"[115] On May 18, 2010, Young embarked upon a North American solo tour to promote his then upcoming album, Le Noise, playing a mix of older songs and new material. Although billed as a solo acoustic tour, Young also played some songs on electric guitars, including Old Black.[116] Young continued his Twisted Road tour with a short East Coast venture during spring 2011. Young also contributed vocals to the Elton John\u2013Leon Russell album The Union, singing the second stanza on the track \"Gone to Shiloh\" and providing backing vocals.[citation needed] In September 2011, Jonathan Demme's third documentary film on the singer songwriter, Neil Young Journeys, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.[117] Like Demme's earlier work with Young, most of the film consists of a simply filmed live performance, in this case, Young's homecoming show in May 2011 at Toronto's Massey Hall, four decades after he first played at the iconic venue. Playing old songs, as well as new ones from Le Noise, Young performs solo on both electric and acoustic instruments. His performance is a counterpoint to Demme's footage of Young's return to Omemee, Ontario, the small town near Toronto where he grew up, which has now become physically unrecognizable, though he vividly recalls events from his childhood there.[citation needed] On January 22, 2012, the Master Class at the Slamdance Festival featured Coffee with Neil Young & Jonathan Demme discussing their film Neil Young Journeys. Young said that he had been recording with Crazy Horse, completing one album and working on another.[118] Neil Young and Crazy Horse performed a version of the Beatles' \"I Saw Her Standing There\" for Paul McCartney's MusiCares Person of the Year dinner on February 10, 2012, in Hollywood.[119] Neil Young with Crazy Horse released the album Americana on June 5, 2012. It was Young's first collaboration with Crazy Horse since the Greendale album and tour in 2003 and 2004. The record is a tribute to unofficial national anthems that jumps from an uncensored version of \"This Land Is Your Land\" to \"Clementine\" and includes a version of \"God Save the Queen\", which Young grew up singing every day in school in Canada.[120] Americana is Neil Young's first album composed entirely of cover songs. On June 5, 2012, American Songwriter also reported that Neil Young & Crazy Horse would be launching their first tour in eight years in support of the album.[121] In 2012, Young toured with Crazy Horse prior to the release of their second album of 2012, Psychedelic Pill, which was released in late October.[citation needed] On August 25, 2012, Young was mistakenly reported dead by NBCNews.com, the day when astronaut Neil Armstrong died.[122] On September 25, 2012, Young's autobiography Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie Dream was released to critical and commercial acclaim.[123] Reviewing the book for the New York Times, Janet Maslin reported that Young chose to write his memoirs in 2012 for two reasons. For one, he needed to take a break from stage performances for health reasons but continue to generate income. For another, he feared the onset of dementia, considering his father's medical history and his own present condition. Maslin gives the book a higher than average grade, describing it as frank but quirky and without pathos as it delves into his relationships and his experience in parenting a child with disabilities as well as his artistic and commercial activities and associations.[124] In November 2013, Young performed at the annual fundraiser for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. Following the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he played an acoustic set to a crowd who had paid a minimum of $2,000 a seat to attend the benefit in the famous Paramour Mansion overlooking downtown Los Angeles.[125] The album A Letter Home was released on April 19, 2014, through Jack White's record label, and his second memoir, entitled Special Deluxe, was tentatively scheduled for a late 2014 release.[needs update] He appeared with Jack White on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on May 12, 2014.[126] The 2014 debut solo album by Chrissie Hynde, entitled Stockholm, featured Young on guitar on the track \"Down the Wrong Way\".[127] Young released his thirty-fifth studio album, Storytone on November 4, 2014. The first song released from the album, \"Who's Gonna Stand Up?\", was released in three different versions on September 25, 2014.[128] Storytone was followed in 2015 by his concept album The Monsanto Years.[129] The Monsanto Years is an album themed both in support of sustainable farming, and to protest the biotechnology company Monsanto.[130] Young achieves this protest in a series of lyrical sentiments against genetically modified food production. He created this album in collaboration with Willie Nelson's sons, Lukas and Micah, and is also backed by Lukas's fellow band members from Promise of the Real.[131] Additionally, Young released a film in tandem to the album, (also entitled \"The Monsanto Years\"), that documents the album's recording, and can be streamed online.[132] In August 2019, The Guardian reported Young, among other environmental activists, was being spied on by the firm.[133] In summer 2015, Young undertook a North America tour titled the Rebel Content Tour. The tour began on July 5, 2015 at the Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and ended on July 24, 2015 at the Wayhome Festival in Oro-Medonte, Ontario. Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real were special guests for the tour.[134][135][136][needs update] After a show on September 19, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois, the tour started over on October 1, 2015 in Missoula, Montana and ended on October 25, 2015 in Mountain View, California.[needs update] In October 2016, Young performed at Desert Trip in Indio, California,[137][138] and announced his thirty-seventh studio album, Peace Trail, recorded with drummer Jim Keltner and bass guitarist Paul Bushnell,[139] which was released that December. On September 8, 2017, Young released Hitchhiker, a studio LP recorded on August 11, 1976 at Indigo Studios in Malibu. The album features ten songs that Young recorded accompanied by acoustic guitar or piano.[140] While different versions of most of the songs have been previously released, the new album will include two never-before-released songs: \"Hawaii\" and \"Give Me Strength\", which Young has occasionally performed live.[141] On July 4, 2017, Young released the song \"Children of Destiny\" which would appear on his next album. On November 3, 2017, Young released \"Already Great\" a song from The Visitor, an album he recorded with Promise of the Real and released on December 1, 2017.[142] On December 1, 2017, Young performed live in Omemee, Ontario, Canada, a town he had lived in as a boy.[143] On March 23, 2018, Young released a soundtrack album for the Daryl Hannah film Paradox. The album is labeled as \"Special Release Series, Volume 10.\"[citation needed] On Record Store Day, April 21, 2018, Warner Records released a two-vinyl LP special edition of Roxy: Tonight's the Night Live, a double live album of a show that Young performed in September 1973 at the Roxy in West Hollywood, with the Santa Monica Flyers. The album is labeled as \"Volume 05\" in Young's Performance Series[citation needed] On October 19, 2018, Young released a live version of his song \"Campaigner\", an excerpt from a forthcoming archival live album titled Songs for Judy, which features solo performances recorded during a November 1976 tour with Crazy Horse. It will be the first release from his new label Shakey Pictures Records.[144][145][146] In November 2018, shortly after his home had been destroyed by the California wildfire, Young criticised President Donald Trump's stance on climate change.[147] In December 2018, Young criticised the promoters of a London show for selecting Barclays Bank as a sponsor. Young objected to the bank's association with fossil fuels. Young explained that he was trying to rectify the situation by finding a different sponsor.[148] Young revived Crazy Horse for a series of low-profile theater gigs beginning May 1, 2018 in Fresno, California. In April 2019, the band began recording \"at least 11 new songs, all written recently\" for a new album titled Colorado. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Neil Young among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[149] On August 19, 2019, Neil Young and Crazy Horse announced the forthcoming release later in August 2019 of the new song \"Rainbow of Colors\", the first single from the forthcoming 10-track studio LP Colorado, Young's first new record with the band in seven years, since 2012's Psychedelic Pill. Young, multi-instrumentalist Nils Lofgren, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina recorded the new album with Neil's co-producer, John Hanlon, in spring 2019. The 10 new songs are ranging from around 3 minutes to over 13 minutes. Colorado is due to be released in October 2019[150][151] on Reprise Records. On August 30, 2019, Young unveiled \"Milky Way\", the first song from Colorado, a love ballad Young had performed several times at concerts over the past few months \u2013 both solo acoustic and with Promise of the Real.[152] As far back as 1988, Young spoke in interviews of his efforts to compile his unreleased material and to remaster his existing catalogue. The collection was eventually titled the Neil Young Archives Series. The first installment, titled The Archives Vol. 1 1963\u20131972, was originally planned for a 2007 release but was delayed, and released on June 2, 2009.[citation needed] Three performances from the Performance Series of the archives were released individually before The Archives Vol. 1. Live at the Fillmore East, a selection of songs from a 1970 gig with Crazy Horse, was released in 2006. Live at Massey Hall 1971, a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, saw release in 2007. Sugar Mountain \u2013 Live at Canterbury House 1968, an early solo performance and, chronologically, the first disc in the performance series, emerged late in 2008.[citation needed] In an interview in 2008, Young discussed Toast, an album originally recorded with Crazy Horse in San Francisco in 2000 but never released.[153] The album will be part of the Special Edition Series of the Archives. No release date currently exists for Toast. The album A Treasure, with live tracks from a 1984\u201385 tour with the International Harvesters, during a time when he was being sued by Geffen Records, was released in June 2011.[citation needed] On July 14, 2009, Young's first four solo albums were reissued as remastered HDCD discs and digital downloads as discs 1\u20134 of the Original Release Series of the Archives.[citation needed] As of 2019, Neil Young has launched a subscription website and application where all of his music is available to stream in high resolution audio. The Neil Young Archives also include his newspaper, The Times-Contrarian, The Hearse Theater, and photos and memorabilia throughout his career.[154] Young lives in Malibu, California, where his house burned to the ground in the 2018 Woolsey Fire.[155] Prior to his move to Santa Monica, he lived on Broken Arrow Ranch, a property of about 1,000 acres[156] near La Honda, California, that he purchased in 1970 for US$350,000 cash (US$2,304,242 in 2019 dollars[67]); the property was subsequently expanded to thousands of acres.[157][158] Young married his first wife, restaurant owner Susan Acevedo, in December 1968. They were together until October 1970, when she filed for divorce.[159] From late 1970 to 1975, Young was in a relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress. The song \"A Man Needs a Maid\" from Harvest is inspired by his seeing her in the film Diary of a Mad Housewife. They met soon afterward and she moved in with him on his ranch in northern California. They have a son, Zeke, who was born September 8, 1972.[160] Young met future wife Pegi Young (n\u00e9e Morton) in 1974 when she was working as a waitress at a diner near his ranch, a story he tells in the 1992 song \"Unknown Legend\". They married in August 1978[161] and had two children together, Ben and Amber. Both Ben and Zeke are diagnosed with cerebral palsy,[162] and Amber with epilepsy.[162] The couple were musical collaborators and co-founded the Bridge School in 1986.[163][164] On July 29, 2014, Young filed for divorce after 36 years of marriage.[57] He has been in a relationship with actress and director Daryl Hannah since 2014.[165] Young and Hannah were reported to have wed on August 25, 2018 in Atascadero, California.[166] Young confirmed his marriage to Hannah in a video released on October 31, 2018.[167] Pegi died on January 1, 2019.[168] Young has been widely reported to be the godfather of actress Amber Tamblyn;[169] in a 2009 interview with Parade, Tamblyn explained that \"godfather\" was \"just a loose term\" for Young, Dennis Hopper, and Dean Stockwell, three famous friends of her father, who were always around the house when she was growing up, and who were important influences on her life.[170] Young is an environmentalist[171] and outspoken advocate for the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled LincVolt. The project involves his 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology as an environmentalist statement.[172][173] In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School,[174] an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his former wife Pegi Young.[175] The last concerts were held in October 2016. On June 14, 2017, Neil and Pegi Young announced that the Bridge School Concerts would no longer continue. Young is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.[176] Young was part owner of Lionel, LLC, a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories.[177] In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains,[177] and remains on the board of directors of Lionel.[2] He has been named as co-inventor on seven US patents related to model trains.[178] Young has long held that the digital audio formats in which most people download music are deeply flawed, and do not provide the rich, warm sound of analog recordings. He is acutely aware of the difference and compares it with taking a shower in tiny ice cubes versus ordinary water.[179] Young and his company PonoMusic developed Pono, a music download service and dedicated music player focusing on \"high-quality\" uncompressed digital audio.[180] It is designed to compete against MP3 and other formats. Pono promised to present songs \"as they first sound during studio recording\".[181][182][183] The service and the selling of the player launched in October 2014.[184][185] In April 2017 it was announced that Pono was discontinued after the company that was running the store, Omnifone, was purchased by Apple in 2016 and almost immediately shut down. Alternative plans were later abandoned (although the Ponomusic website has remained \"under construction\" as of 2018.) In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young as eighty-third in its ranking of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" (although in a more recent version of the list, he has been moved up to seventeenth place), describing him as a \"restless experimenter\u00a0... who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory\".[186] Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he uses frequently just a few instruments, as is explained by his longtime guitar technician Larry Cragg in the film Neil Young: Heart of Gold. They include: Other notable (or odd) instruments played by Young include: Young plays Hohner Marine Band harmonicas and is often seen using a harmonica holder[citation needed].[188] Young owns a restored Estey reed organ, serial number 167272, dating from 1885, which he frequently plays in concert.[189] Young owns a glass harmonica which is used in the recording of \"I do\" on the 2019 album Colorado.[190] Young uses various vintage Fender Tweed Deluxe amplifiers. His preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. He purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for US$50 (US$383 in 2019 dollars[67]) from Sol Betnun Music on Larchmont in Hollywood and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it is the original model that sounds superior and is crucial to his trademark sound.[191] The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950s Magnatone 280 (similar to the amplifier used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on \"See the Sky About to Rain\". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an effects pedal. Tom Wheeler's book Soul of Tone highlights the device on page 182/183.[192] As one of the original founders of Farm Aid (1985\u2013), he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in Mountain View, California, Young and his ex-wife have hosted the Bridge School Concerts, which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, The Who, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Tom Waits, Thom Yorke of Radiohead, R.E.M., Foo Fighters, Metallica, Pearl Jam, Sonic Youth, The Smashing Pumpkins, Paul McCartney and Dave Matthews. He announced in June 2017, however, that he would no longer host the concerts.[194] The concerts are a benefit for the Bridge School, which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stemmed at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have cerebral palsy and his daughter, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young was nominated for an Oscar in 1994 for his song \"Philadelphia\" from the film Philadelphia. Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song \"Streets of Philadelphia\" from the same film. In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that \"the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song\". That same night, Tom Hanks, when accepting the Oscar for Best Actor, gave credit for his inspiration to Young's song. Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an honorary doctorate of music from Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, in 1992, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from San Francisco State University in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School. In 2006, Young was given Manitoba's highest civilian honour when he was appointed to the Order of Manitoba. In 2009, he was appointed to Canada's second highest civilian order, the Order of Canada. Rolling Stone magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time,[195] and in 2003, included five of his albums in its list of 500 greatest albums of all time.[196] In 2000, Young was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.[197] In 2006, when Paste magazine compiled a \"Greatest Living Songwriters\" list, Young was ranked second behind Bob Dylan. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other's records.) He ranked thirty-ninth on VH1's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has \"avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young's peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.\"[83] Young's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as Blind Melon, Phish, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. Young is referred to as \"the Godfather of Grunge\" because of the influence he had on Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the experimental rock group Sonic Youth, and Thom Yorke of Radiohead. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favourably compared his singing voice to Young's. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought After the Gold Rush (1970), and \"immediately fell in love\" with his work, calling it \"extraordinary\".[198] Yorke later covered the title track in concert. Dave Matthews lists Young as one of his favourite songwriters and most important inspirations and covers his songs on occasion. The British indie band The Bluetones named their number one debut album after the song \"Expecting to Fly\" (written by Young when still with Buffalo Springfield) and have covered the song while touring. Young also inspired the singer-songwriter Noel Gallagher of Oasis, who covered \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" on the live album Familiar to Millions (2000). The Australian rock group Powderfinger named themselves after Young's song \"Powderfinger\" from Rust Never Sleeps (1979). The members of the Constantines have occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze.[199] While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008, during the Canadian leg of his tour, Bob Dylan visited Young's former home in River Heights, where Young spent his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Young's first songs were composed. Jason Bond, an East Carolina University biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after Young,[200] his favourite singer.[201] In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award by the civil liberties group People for the American Way. Young was honoured as the MusiCares Person of the Year on January 29, 2010, two nights prior to the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. He was also nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for \"Fork in the Road\" and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package for Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 (1963\u20131972). Young won the latter Grammy Award. In 2010, he was ranked No.\u00a026 in Gibson.com's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.[202]",

After embarking on a music career in the 1960s, he moved to Los Angeles, where he formed Buffalo Springfield with Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and others. Young released two solo albums and three as a member of Buffalo Springfield by the time he joined Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash in 1969. From his early solo albums and those with his backing band Crazy Horse, Young has recorded a steady stream of studio and live albums, sometimes warring with his recording company along the way.\nYoung has received several Grammy and Juno awards. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him twice: as a solo artist in 1995 and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.[5] In 2000, Rolling Stone named Young the 34th greatest rock 'n roll artist. His guitar work, deeply personal lyrics[6][7][8] and signature tenor singing voice[9][10] define his long career. He also plays piano and harmonica on many albums, which frequently combine folk, rock, country and other musical styles. His often distorted electric guitar playing, especially with Crazy Horse, earned him the nickname \"Godfather of Grunge\"[11] and led to his 1995 album Mirror Ball with Pearl Jam. More recently he has been backed by Promise of the Real.\nYoung directed (or co-directed) films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (2008). He also contributed to the soundtracks of the films  Philadelphia (1993) and Dead Man (1995).\nYoung has lived in California since the 1960s but retains Canadian citizenship.[12] He was awarded the Order of Manitoba on July 14, 2006,[4] and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 30, 2009.[3] He became a United States citizen, taking dual citizenship[13][14] on January 22, 2020.[15]\nNeil Young[16] was born on November 12, 1945, in Toronto, Ontario.[17][18] His father, Scott Alexander Young (1918\u20132005), was a journalist and sportswriter who also wrote fiction.[19] His mother, Edna Blow Ragland \"Rassy\" Young (1918\u20131990) was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.[20] Although Canadian, his mother had American and French ancestry.[21] Young's parents married in 1940 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and their first son, Robert \"Bob\" Young, was born in 1942. Shortly after Young's birth in 1945, his family moved to rural Omemee, Ontario, which Young later described fondly as a \"sleepy little place\".[22] Young suffered from polio in 1951 during the last major outbreak of the disease in Ontario[23] (the Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, then aged nine, also contracted the virus during this epidemic).[24] After his recovery, the Young family vacationed in Florida. During that period, Young briefly attended Faulkner Elementary School in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. In 1952, upon returning to Canada, Young moved from Omemee to Winnipeg for a year, before relocating to Toronto and Pickering. Young became interested in popular music he heard on the radio.[25] When Young was twelve, his father, who had had several extramarital affairs, left his mother. His mother asked for a divorce, which was granted in 1960.[26] Young went to live with his mother, who moved back to Winnipeg, while his brother Bob stayed with his father in Toronto.[27]\n\u2014 Comrie Smith, Young's teenage friend[28]\nDuring the mid-1950s, Young listened to rock 'n roll, rockabilly, doo-wop, R&amp;B, country, and western pop. He idolized Elvis Presley and later referred to him in a number of his songs.[29] Other early musical influences included Link Wray,[30] Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs, The Ventures, Cliff Richard and the Shadows,[31] Chuck Berry, Hank Marvin, Little Richard, Fats Domino, The Chantels, The Monotones, Ronnie Self, the Fleetwoods, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Gogi Grant.[32] Young first began to play music himself on a plastic ukulele, before, as he would later relate, going on to \"a better ukulele to a banjo ukulele to a baritone ukulele \u2013 everything but a guitar.\"[33]\nYoung and his mother settled into the working-class area of Fort Rouge, Winnipeg, where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band, the Jades, and met Ken Koblun. While attending Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands, eventually dropping out of school in favour of a musical career.[34] Young's first stable band was the Squires, with Ken Koblun, Jeff Wuckert and Bill Edmondson on drums, who had a local hit called \"The Sultan\".  The band played in Fort William (now part of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer, Ray Dee, who Young called \"the original Briggs\".[35] While playing at The Flamingo, Young met Stephen Stills, whose band the Company were playing the same venue, and they became friends.[36] The Squires played in several dance halls and clubs in Winnipeg and Ontario.[37]\nAfter leaving the Squires, Young worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met Joni Mitchell.[38] Mitchell recalls Young as having been highly influenced by Bob Dylan at the time.[39] Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as \"Sugar Mountain\", about lost youth. Mitchell wrote \"The Circle Game\" in response.[40] The Winnipeg band The Guess Who (with Randy Bachman as lead guitarist) had a Canadian Top 40 hit with Young's \"Flying on the Ground is Wrong\", which was Young's first major success as a songwriter.[41]\nIn 1965, Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, while in Toronto, he joined the Rick James-fronted Mynah Birds. The band managed to secure a record deal with the Motown label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being AWOL from the Navy Reserve.[42] After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and the bass player Bruce Palmer decided to pawn the group's musical equipment and buy a Pontiac hearse, which they used to relocate to Los Angeles.[43] Young admitted in a 2009 interview that he was in the United States illegally until he received a \"green card\" (permanent residency permit) in 1970.[44]\nOnce they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay after a chance encounter in traffic on Sunset Boulevard.[43] Along with Dewey Martin, they formed Buffalo Springfield. A mixture of folk, country, psychedelia, and rock, lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young, made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record Buffalo Springfield (1966) sold well after Stills' topical song \"For What It's Worth\" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar. According to Rolling Stone, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and other sources, Buffalo Springfield helped create the genres of folk rock and country rock.[45]\nDistrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, worsened the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album, Buffalo Springfield Again, was released in late 1967, but two of Young's three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.\nFrom that album, \"Mr. Soul\" was the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group performed together. \"Broken Arrow\" features snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a soundbite of Dewey Martin singing \"Mr. Soul\" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. \"Expecting to Fly\" featured a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track, Jack Nitzsche, dubbed \"symphonic pop\".[citation needed]\nIn May 1968, the band split up for good, but to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final studio album, Last Time Around, was released. The album was primarily composed of recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs \"On the Way Home\" and \"I Am a Child\", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony. The three surviving members, Furay, Stills, and Young, appeared together as Buffalo Springfield at Young's annual Bridge School Benefit on October 23\u201324, 2010, and at Bonnaroo in the summer of 2011. Young also played as a studio session guitarist for some 1968 recordings by The Monkees which appeared on the Head and Instant Replay albums.[46]\nAfter the break-up of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with Reprise Records, home of his colleague and friend Joni Mitchell, with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who managed Young until his death in 2019. Young and Roberts immediately began work on Young's first solo record, Neil Young (January 22, 1969),[47] which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview,[48] Young deprecated the album as being \"overdubbed rather than played.\" The album contains songs that remain a staple of his live shows including \"The Loner.\"\nFor his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets: Danny Whitten on guitar, Billy Talbot on bass guitar, and Ralph Molina on drums. These three took the name Crazy Horse (after the historical figure of the same name), and Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (May 1969), is credited to \"Neil Young with Crazy Horse.\" Recorded in just two weeks, the album includes \"Cinnamon Girl\", \"Cowgirl in the Sand\", and \"Down by the River.\" Young reportedly wrote all three songs in bed on the same day while nursing a high fever of 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C).[49]\nShortly after the release of Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, who had already released one album Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash as a trio in May 1969. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group \u2013 winners of the 1969 \"Best New Artist\" Grammy Award \u2013 was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.[50] The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous Woodstock Festival, during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: \"One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar\".[51] During the making of their first album, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he \"wanted to play folk music in a rock band.\"[52] Despite the tension, Young's tenure with CSN&amp;Y coincided with the band's most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.\nYoung wrote \"Ohio\" following the Kent State massacre on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSN&amp;Y and immediately released as a single, even though CSN&amp;Y's \"Teach Your Children\" was still climbing the singles charts.\nLater in the year, Young released his third solo album, After the Gold Rush (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, Nils Lofgren, Stephen Stills, and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, with a wider range of sounds. Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Don't Let It Bring You Down\", the country-influenced singles \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and \"When You Dance I Can Really Love\", and the title track, \"After the Gold Rush\", played on piano, with dream-like lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns. Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"Southern Man\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting Lynyrd Skynyrd to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man Ronnie Van Zant was later photographed wearing a Tonight's the Night T-shirt on the cover of an album.\nIn the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like \"Journey through the Past\", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like \"See the Sky About to Rain\", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young's tour, now entitled \"Journey Through the Past\", continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at Carnegie Hall and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto's Massey Hall, which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young's Archive series.\nNear the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the Johnny Cash TV show. \"The Needle and the Damage Done\", a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction, had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who eventually died while battling his drug problems.[53][54] While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of Quadrafonic Sound Studios owner Elliot Mazer to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them The Stray Gators, and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals. Against the advice of his producer David Briggs, he scrapped plans for the imminent release[55] of the live acoustic recording in favour of a studio album consisting of the Nashville sessions, electric-guitar oriented sessions recorded later in his barn, and two recordings made with the London Symphony Orchestra at Barking (credited as Barking Town Hall and now the Broadway Theatre) during March 1971.[56] The result was Young's fourth album, Harvest (February 14, 1972). The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album's live acoustic performance of \"Needle and the Damage Done.\"\nAfter his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California (\"Broken Arrow Ranch\", where he lived until his divorce in 2014.[57]). He wrote the song \"Old Man\" in honor of the land's longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song \"A Man Needs a Maid\" was inspired by his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress. \"Heart of Gold\" was released as the first single from Harvest, the only No.\u00a01 hit in his career. \"Old Man\" was also popular.\nThe album's recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the Decade (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described \"Heart of Gold\" as the song that \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\"\nAlthough a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of Harvest, it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent alcohol/diazepam overdose. Young described the incident to Rolling Stone's Cameron Crowe in 1975:[58] \"[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd OD'd. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.\"\nOn the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer Kenny Buttrey, a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the hard rock milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer Johnny Barbata, while David Crosby and Graham Nash contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, Time Fades Away (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as \"[his] least favorite record\", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's Official Release Series). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. Time Fades Away, for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. Time was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the \"Ditch Trilogy\", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of Harvest (1972).[59] These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time.\nIn the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar and piano and Harvest/Time Fades Away veteran Ben Keith on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry, Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, Tonight's the Night (June 20, 1975). The album's dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so.[60] While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, On the Beach (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song \"See the Sky About to Rain\", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like Time Fades Away, it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young's most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of On the Beach described the music as \"mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary\".[61]\nAfter completing On the Beach, Young reunited with Harvest producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, Homegrown. Most of the songs were written after Young's break-up with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though Homegrown was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, Tonight's the Night, at the suggestion of Band bassist Rick Danko.[62] Young further explained his move by saying: \"It was a little too personal ... it scared me\".[62] Most of the songs from Homegrown were later incorporated into other Young albums, but the original album never surfaced. Tonight's the Night when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the \"ditch\" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.[63]\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour which was recorded and released in 2014 as CSNY 1974. It was one of the first ever stadium tours, and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.[64]\nIn 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with Frank Sampedro on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, Zuma (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; \"Cortez the Killer\", a retelling of the Spanish conquest of Mexico from the viewpoint of the Aztecs, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. Zuma's closing track, \"Through My Sails\", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.\nIn 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album Long May You Run (September 20, 1976), credited to The Stills-Young Band; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a telegram that read: \"Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil.\"[65]\nIn 1976, Young performed with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and numerous other rock musicians in the high-profile all-star concert The Last Waltz, the final performance by The Band. The release of Martin Scorsese's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of \"Helpless\".[66] American Stars 'n Bars (June 13, 1977) contained two songs originally recorded for the Homegrown album, \"Homegrown\" and \"Star of Bethlehem\", as well as newer material, including the future concert staple \"Like a Hurricane\". Performers on the record included Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and Young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nicolette Larson along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation Decade, a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.\nComes a Time (October 2, 1978), Young's first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, also featured Larson and Crazy Horse.  The album became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time and marked a return to his folk roots, including a cover of Ian Tyson's \"Four Strong Winds\", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada.  Another of the album's songs, \"Lotta Love\", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979.  In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young's film Human Highway, which took its name from a song featured on Comes a Time. Over four years, Young would spend $3,000,000 of his own money on production (US$11,759,694 in 2019 dollars[67]). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the post-punk band Devo, whose members appeared in the film.[68]\nYoung set out in 1978 on the lengthy \"Rust Never Sleeps\" tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an aggressive style of playing, were later seen as a response to punk rock.[citation needed] Two new songs, the acoustic \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\" and electric \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" were the centerpiece of the new material. Their lyrics have been among Young's most widely quoted.[citation needed] The album has also widely been considered a precursor of grunge music and many grunge artists have said they were inspired by Young's distorted guitars on the B side to this album. Young also compared the rise of Johnny Rotten with that of the recently deceased \"King\" Elvis Presley, who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an icon. Rotten returned the favour by playing one of Young's songs, \"Revolution Blues\" from On the Beach, on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians.[69]\nYoung's two accompanying albums Rust Never Sleeps (July 2, 1979; new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and Live Rust (November 19, 1979) (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B.  A movie version of the concerts, also called Rust Never Sleeps (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\". Young worked with rock artist Jim Evans to create the poster art for the film, using the Star Wars Jawas as a theme. Young's work since Harvest (1972) had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of Rolling Stone voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected Rust Never Sleeps as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well. The Village Voice named Rust Never Sleeps as the year's winner in the Pazz &amp; Jop Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade. The Warner Music Vision release on VHS of Rust Never Sleeps in 1987 had a running time of 116 minutes, and although fully manufactured in Germany, was initially imported from there by the markets throughout Europe.\nAt the start of the decade, distracted by medical concerns relating to the cerebral palsy of his son, Ben, Young had little time to spend on writing and recording.[70] After providing the incidental music to a 1980 biographical film of Hunter S. Thompson entitled Where the Buffalo Roam, Young released Hawks &amp; Doves (November 3, 1980)', a short record pieced together from sessions going back to 1974.[70]\n1981's Re\u00b7ac\u00b7tor, an electric album recorded with Crazy Horse, also included material from the 1970s.[71] Young did not tour in support of either album; in total, he played only one show, a set at the 1980 Bread and Roses Festival in Berkeley,[72] between the end of his 1978 tour with Crazy Horse and the start of his tour with the Trans Band in mid-1982.[citation needed]\n\u2014 Neil Young[73]\nThe 1982 album Trans, which incorporated vocoders, synthesizers, and electronic beats, was Young's first for the new label Geffen Records (distributed at the time by Warner Bros. Records, whose parent Warner Music Group owns most of Young's solo and band catalogue) and represented a distinct stylistic departure. Young later revealed that an inspiration for the album was the theme of technology and communication with his son Ben, who has severe cerebral palsy and cannot speak.[74] An extensive tour preceded the release of the album, and was documented by the video Neil Young in Berlin, which saw release in 1986. MTV played the video for \"Sample and Hold\" in light rotation. The entire song contained \"robot vocals\" by Young and Nils Lofgren.[citation needed]. The song \"After Berlin\" as seen in that video, was the only time Neil Young has ever performed the song.\nYoung's next album, 1983's Everybody's Rockin', included several rockabilly covers and clocked in at less than twenty-five minutes in length. Young was backed by the Shocking Pinks for the supporting US tour. Trans (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head David Geffen for its lack of commercial appeal, and with Everybody's Rockin' following only seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music \"unrepresentative\" of himself.[75] The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos \u2013 Tim Pope directed the videos for \"Wonderin'\" and \"Cry, Cry, Cry\". Also premiered in 1983, though little seen, was Human Highway. Co-directed and co-written by Young, the long-gestating eclectic comedy starred Young, Dean Stockwell, Russ Tamblyn, Dennis Hopper, David Blue, Sally Kirkland, Charlotte Stewart and members of Devo.[citation needed]\nThe first year without a Neil Young album since the start of Young's musical career with Buffalo Springfield in 1966 was in 1984. Young's lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1982 country album Old Ways.[76] It was also the year when Young's third child was born, a girl named Amber Jean. Later diagnosed with inherited epilepsy, Amber Jean was Neil and Pegi's second child together.[citation needed]\nYoung spent most of 1984 and all of 1985 touring for Old Ways (August 12, 1985) with his country band, the International Harvesters. The album was finally released in an altered form midway through 1985. Young also appeared at that year's Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, collaborating with Crosby, Stills and Nash for the quartet's first performance for a paying audience in over ten years.[citation needed]\nYoung's last two albums for Geffen were more conventional in the genre, although they incorporated production techniques like synthesizers and echoing drums that were previously uncommon in Young's music. Young recorded 1986's Landing on Water without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, Life, which emerged in 1987. Young's album sales dwindled steadily throughout the eighties; today Life remains his all-time-least successful studio album, with an estimated four hundred thousand sales worldwide.[77]\nSwitching back to his old label Reprise Records, Young continued to tour relentlessly, assembling a new blues band called The Bluenotes in mid-1987 (a legal dispute with musician Harold Melvin forced the eventual rechristening of the band as Ten Men Working midway through the tour). The addition of a brass section provided a new jazzier sound, and the title track of 1988's This Note's For You became Young's first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and Michael Jackson, the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, \"What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?\" Despite this, the video was eventually named best video of the year by the network in 1989.[78] By comparison, the major music cable network of Young's home nation, Muchmusic, ran the video immediately.[citation needed]\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album American Dream and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour. The album was only the second-ever studio record for the quartet.[citation needed]\nYoung's 1989 single \"Rockin' in the Free World\", which hit No.\u00a02 on the US mainstream-rock charts, and accompanying the album, Freedom, rocketed him back into the popular consciousness after a decade of sometimes-difficult genre experiments. The album's lyrics were often overtly political; \"Rockin' in the Free World\" deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President George H.W. Bush.[79]\nThe use of heavy feedback and distortion on several Freedom tracks was reminiscent of the Rust Never Sleeps (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of grunge. The rising stars of the genre, including Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, frequently cited Young as a major influence, contributing to his popular revival. A tribute album called The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young was released in 1989, featuring covers by alternative and grunge acts including Sonic Youth, Nick Cave, Soul Asylum, Dinosaur Jr, and the Pixies.\nYoung's 1990 album Ragged Glory, recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his Northern California ranch, continued this distortion-heavy esthetic. Young toured for the album with Orange County, California country-punk band Social Distortion and alternative rock pioneers Sonic Youth as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans.[80] Weld, a two-disc live album documenting the tour, was released in 1991.[80] Sonic Youth's influence was most evident on Arc, a 35-minute collage of feedback and distortion spliced together at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and originally packaged with some versions of Weld.[80]\n1992's Harvest Moon marked an abrupt return to the country and folk-rock stylings of Harvest (1972) and reunited him with some of the musicians from that album, including singers Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor. The title track was a minor hit and the record was well received by critics, winning the Juno Award for Album of the Year in 1994. Young also contributed to Randy Bachman's nostalgic 1992 tune \"Prairie Town\", and garnered a 1993 Academy Award nomination for his song \"Philadelphia\", from the soundtrack of the Jonathan Demme movie of the same name. An MTV Unplugged performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with Booker T. and the M.G.s for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with Blues Traveler, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of \"Rockin' in the Free World\" played with Pearl Jam, foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later.\nIn 1994 Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for Sleeps with Angels, a record whose dark, somber mood was influenced by Kurt Cobain's death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain's life and death, without mentioning him by name. Cobain had quoted Young's lyric \"It's better to burn out than fade away\" (a line from \"My My, Hey Hey\") in his suicide note. Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to his death.[81] Young and Pearl Jam performed \"Act of Love\" at an abortion rights benefit along with Crazy Horse, and were present at a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner, sparking interest in a collaboration between the two.[82] Still enamored with the grunge scene, Young reconnected with Pearl Jam in 1995 for the live-in-the-studio album Mirror Ball and a tour of Europe with the band and producer Brendan O'Brien backing Young. 1995 also marked Young's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where he was inducted by Eddie Vedder.\nYoung has consistently demonstrated the unbridled passion of an artist who understands that self-renewal is the only way to avoid burning out. For this reason, he has remained one of the most significant artists of the rock and roll era.\nIn 1995, Young and his manager Elliot Roberts founded a record label, Vapor Records.[85] It has released recordings by Tegan and Sara, Spoon, Jonathan Richman, Vic Chesnutt, Everest, Pegi Young, Jets Overhead, and Young himself, among others.[85]\nYoung's next collaborative partner was filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, who asked Young to compose a soundtrack to his 1995 black and white western film Dead Man. Young's instrumental soundtrack was improvised while he watched the film alone in a studio. The death of longtime mentor, friend, and producer David Briggs in late 1995 prompted Young to reconnect with Crazy Horse the following year for the album and tour Broken Arrow. A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, Year of the Horse, emerged in 1997. From 1996\u201397 Young and Crazy Horse toured extensively throughout Europe and North America, including a stint as part of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival's sixth annual tour.\nIn 1998, Young renewed his collaboration with the rock band Phish, sharing the stage at the annual Farm Aid concert and then at Young's Bridge School Benefit, where he joined headliners Phish for renditions of \"Helpless\" and \"I Shall Be Released\".[86] Phish declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on his 1999 North American tour.\nThe decade ended with the release in late 1999 of Looking Forward, another reunion with Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet earned US$42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.\nNeil Young continued to release new material at a rapid pace through the first decade of the new millennium. The studio album Silver &amp; Gold and live album Road Rock Vol. 1 were released in 2000 and were both accompanied by live concert films. His 2001 single \"Let's Roll\" was a tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks, and the effective action taken by the passengers and crew on Flight 93 in particular.[87] At the \"America: A Tribute to Heroes\" benefit concert for the victims of the attacks, Young performed John Lennon's \"Imagine\" and accompanied Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready on \"Long Road\", a Pearl Jam song that was written with Young during the Mirrorball sessions. \"Let's Roll\" was included on 2002's Are You Passionate?, an album mostly composed of mellow love songs dedicated to Young's wife, Pegi, backed by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s.[citation needed]\nIn 2003, Young released Greendale, a concept album recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. The songs loosely revolved around the murder of a police officer in a small town in California and its effects on the town's inhabitants.[88] Under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\", Young directed an accompanying film of the same name, featuring actors lip-synching to the music from the album. He toured extensively with the Greendale material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America, Japan, and Australia. Young began using biodiesel on the 2004 Greendale tour, powering his trucks and tour buses with the fuel. \"Our Greendale tour is now ozone friendly\", he said. \"I plan to continue to use this government approved and regulated fuel exclusively from now on to prove that it is possible to deliver the goods anywhere in North America without using foreign oil, while being environmentally responsible.\"[89] Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.[citation needed]\nIn March 2005, while working on the Prairie Wind album in Nashville, Young was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. He was treated successfully with a minimally invasive neuroradiological procedure, performed in a New York hospital on March 29,[90] but two days afterwards he passed out on a New York street from bleeding from the femoral artery, which radiologists had used to access the aneurysm.[91] The complication forced Young to cancel his scheduled appearance at the Juno Awards telecast in Winnipeg, but within months he was back on stage, appearing at the close of the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario, on July 2. During the performance, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called \"When God Made Me\". Young's brush with death influenced Prairie Wind's themes of retrospection and mortality.[92] The album's live premiere in Nashville was recorded by filmmaker Jonathan Demme in the 2006 film Neil Young: Heart of Gold.[citation needed]\nYoung's renewed activism manifested itself in the 2006 album Living with War, which like the much earlier song \"Ohio\", was recorded and released in less than a month as a direct result of current events.[93] In early 2006, three years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the sectarian war and casualties there were escalating. While doing errands on a visit to his daughter, Young had seen a newspaper photo of wounded U.S. veterans on a transport plane to Germany, and noticing that the same paper devoted little actual coverage to the story, he was unable to get the image out of his head, realizing the suffering caused to families by the war had not truly registered to him and most Americans who were not directly affected by it. Young cried, and immediately got his guitar out and began to write multiple songs at once. Within a few days he had completed work and assembled a band. He later said he had restrained himself for a long time from writing any protest songs, waiting for someone younger, with a different perspective, but no one seemed to be saying anything.[citation needed]\nMost of the album's songs rebuked the Bush administration's policy of war by examining its human costs to soldiers, their loved ones, and civilians, but Young also included a few songs on other themes, and an outright protest titled, \"Let's Impeach the President\",[94] in which he stated that Bush had lied to lead the country into war. Young's lyrics in another song named Illinois Senator Barack Obama, who had not declared any intention to run for president at the time and was widely unexpected to be able to win either the Democratic Party nomination or a general election, as potentially a replacement for Bush. That summer, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young reunited for the supporting \"Freedom of Speech Tour '06\", in which they played Young's new protest songs alongside the group's older material, meeting with both enthusiasm and anger from different fans, some of whom were supportive of Bush politically. CSNY D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, a concert film of the tour directed by Young himself, was released in 2008, along with an accompanying live album.[citation needed]\nWhile Young had never been a stranger to eco-friendly lyrics, themes of environmentalist spirituality and activism became increasingly prominent in his work throughout the 1990s and 2000s, especially on Greendale (2003)[95] and Living with War (2006).[96] The trend continued on 2007's Chrome Dreams II, with lyrics exploring Young's personal eco-spirituality.[97] Also in 2007, Young accepted an invitation to participate in Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino, contributing his version of \"Walking to New Orleans\".[citation needed]\nYoung remains on the board of directors of Farm Aid, an organization he co-founded with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp in 1985. According to its website, it is the longest running concert benefit series in the U.S. and it has raised $43 million since its first benefit concert in 1985. Each year, Young co-hosts and performs with well-known guest performers who include Dave Matthews and producers who include Evelyn Shriver and Mark Rothbaum, at the Farm Aid annual benefit concerts to raise funds and provide grants to family farms and prevent foreclosures, provide a crisis hotline, and create and promote home grown farm food in the United States.[98]\nIn 2008, Young revealed his latest project, the production of a hybrid-engine 1959 Lincoln called LincVolt.[99] A new album loosely based on the Lincvolt project, Fork in the Road, was released on April 7, 2009.[100] The album, partly composed of love songs to the car, also commented on the economic crisis, with one narrator attacking the Wall Street bailouts enacted in late 2008. Unfortunately, the car caught fire in November 2010, in a California warehouse, and along the way it burned an estimated US$850,000 worth of Young's rock and roll memorabilia collection. Initial reports suggest the fire might have been triggered by an error in the vehicle's plug-in charging system. Young blamed the fire on human error and said he and his team were committed to rebuilding the car. \"The wall charging system was not completely tested and had never been left unattended. A mistake was made. It was not the fault of the car\", he said.[citation needed]\nA Jonathan Demme concert film from a 2007 concert at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, called the Neil Young Trunk Show premiered on March 21, 2009, at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival in Austin, Texas. It was featured at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2009 and was released in the U.S. on March 19, 2010[101] to critical acclaim.[102][103][104]\nYoung's guested on the album Potato Hole, released on April 21, 2009 by Memphis organ player Booker T. Jones, of Booker T. &amp; the MGs fame. Young plays guitar on nine of the album's ten instrumental tracks, alongside Drive-By Truckers, who already had three guitar players, giving some songs on the album a total of five guitar tracks. Jones contributed guitars on a couple of tracks.[citation needed]\nIn 2009, Young headlined the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, England,[105] at Hard Rock Calling in London (where he was joined onstage by Paul McCartney for a rendition of \"A Day in the Life\") and, after years of unsuccessful booking attempts, the Isle of Wight Festival[106] in addition to performances at the Big Day Out festival in New Zealand and Australia and the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona.[citation needed]\nYoung has been a vocal opponent of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas. When discussing the environmental impact on the oilsands of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Young asserted that the area now resembles the Japanese city of Hiroshima in the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack of World War II.[107] Young has referred to issues surrounding the proposed use of oil pipelines as \"scabs on our lives\".[107] In an effort to become more involved, Young has worked directly with the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to draw attention to this issue, performing benefit concerts and speaking publicly on the subject. In 2014, he played four shows in Canada dedicated to the Honor the Treaties[108] movement, raising money for the Athabasca Chipewyan legal defence fund.[109] In 2015, he and Willie Nelson held a festival in Neligh, Nebraska, called Harvest the Hope, raising awareness of the impact of tar sands and oil pipelines on Native Americans and family farmers. Both received honours from leaders of the Rosebud, Oglala Lakota, Ponca and Omaha nations, and were invested with sacred buffalo robes.[110]\nYoung participated in the Blue Dot Tour, which was organized and fronted by environmental activist David Suzuki, and toured all 10 Canadian provinces alongside other Canadian artists including the Barenaked Ladies, Feist, and Robert Bateman. The intent of Young's participation in this tour was to raise awareness of the environmental damage caused by the exploitation of tar sands. Young has argued that the amount of CO2 released as a byproduct of tar-sand oil extraction is equivalent to the amount released by the total number of cars in Canada each day.[111] Young has faced criticism by representatives from within the Canadian petroleum industry, who have argued that his statements are irresponsible.[107] Young's opposition to the construction of oil pipelines has influenced his music as well. His song, \"Who's Going to Stand Up?\" was written to protest this issue, and features the lyric \"Ban fossil fuel and draw the line / Before we build one more pipeline\".[107]\nIn addition to directly criticizing members of the oil industry, Young has also focused blame on the actions of the Canadian government for ignoring the environmental impacts of climate change. He referred to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper as \"an embarrassment to many Canadians ...[and] a very poor imitation of the George Bush administration in the United States\".[111] Young has also been critical of Barack Obama's government for failing to uphold the promises made regarding environmental policies during his election campaign.[111]\nYoung recorded \"A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop\" in response to Starbucks' possible involvement with Monsanto and use of genetically-modified food.[112][113] The song was included on his concept album called The Monsanto Years.[114]\nOn January 22, 2010, Young performed \"Long May You Run\" on the final episode of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. On the same night, he and Dave Matthews performed the Hank Williams song \"Alone and Forsaken\", for the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief charity telethon, in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Young also performed \"Long May You Run\" at the closing ceremony of the 2010 Olympic winter games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In May 2010, it was revealed Young had begun working on a new studio album produced by Daniel Lanois. This was announced by David Crosby, who said that the album \"will be a very heartfelt record. I expect it will be a very special record.\"[115] On May 18, 2010, Young embarked upon a North American solo tour to promote his then upcoming album, Le Noise, playing a mix of older songs and new material. Although billed as a solo acoustic tour, Young also played some songs on electric guitars, including Old Black.[116] Young continued his Twisted Road tour with a short East Coast venture during spring 2011. Young also contributed vocals to the Elton John\u2013Leon Russell album The Union, singing the second stanza on the track \"Gone to Shiloh\" and providing backing vocals.[citation needed]\nIn September 2011, Jonathan Demme's third documentary film on the singer songwriter, Neil Young Journeys, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.[117] Like Demme's earlier work with Young, most of the film consists of a simply filmed live performance, in this case, Young's homecoming show in May 2011 at Toronto's Massey Hall, four decades after he first played at the iconic venue. Playing old songs, as well as new ones from Le Noise, Young performs solo on both electric and acoustic instruments. His performance is a counterpoint to Demme's footage of Young's return to Omemee, Ontario, the small town near Toronto where he grew up, which has now become physically unrecognizable, though he vividly recalls events from his childhood there.[citation needed]\nOn January 22, 2012, the Master Class at the Slamdance Festival featured Coffee with Neil Young &amp; Jonathan Demme discussing their film Neil Young Journeys. Young said that he had been recording with Crazy Horse, completing one album and working on another.[118]\nNeil Young and Crazy Horse performed a version of the Beatles' \"I Saw Her Standing There\" for Paul McCartney's MusiCares Person of the Year dinner on February 10, 2012, in Hollywood.[119]\nNeil Young with Crazy Horse released the album Americana on June 5, 2012. It was Young's first collaboration with Crazy Horse since the Greendale album and tour in 2003 and 2004.  The record is a tribute to unofficial national anthems that jumps from an uncensored version of \"This Land Is Your Land\" to \"Clementine\" and includes a version of \"God Save the Queen\", which Young grew up singing every day in school in Canada.[120] Americana is Neil Young's first album composed entirely of cover songs. On June 5, 2012, American Songwriter also reported that Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse would be launching their first tour in eight years in support of the album.[121]\nIn 2012, Young toured with Crazy Horse prior to the release of their second album of 2012, Psychedelic Pill, which was released in late October.[citation needed]\nOn August 25, 2012, Young was mistakenly reported dead by NBCNews.com, the day when astronaut Neil Armstrong died.[122]\nOn September 25, 2012, Young's autobiography Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie Dream was released to critical and commercial acclaim.[123] Reviewing the book for the New York Times, Janet Maslin reported that Young chose to write his memoirs in 2012 for two reasons. For one, he needed to take a break from stage performances for health reasons but continue to generate income. For another, he feared the onset of dementia, considering his father's medical history and his own present condition. Maslin gives the book a higher than average grade, describing it as frank but quirky and without pathos as it delves into his relationships and his experience in parenting a child with disabilities as well as his artistic and commercial activities and associations.[124]\nIn November 2013, Young performed at the annual fundraiser for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. Following the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he played an acoustic set to a crowd who had paid a minimum of $2,000 a seat to attend the benefit in the famous Paramour Mansion overlooking downtown Los Angeles.[125]\nThe album A Letter Home was released on April 19, 2014, through Jack White's record label, and his second memoir, entitled Special Deluxe, was tentatively scheduled for a late 2014 release.[needs update] He appeared with Jack White on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on May 12, 2014.[126]\nThe 2014 debut solo album by Chrissie Hynde, entitled Stockholm, featured Young on guitar on the track \"Down the Wrong Way\".[127]\nYoung released his thirty-fifth studio album, Storytone on November 4, 2014. The first song released from the album, \"Who's Gonna Stand Up?\", was released in three different versions on September 25, 2014.[128]\nStorytone was followed in 2015 by his concept album The Monsanto Years.[129] The Monsanto Years is an album themed both in support of sustainable farming, and to protest the biotechnology company Monsanto.[130] Young achieves this protest in a series of lyrical sentiments against genetically modified food production. He created this album in collaboration with Willie Nelson's sons, Lukas and Micah, and is also backed by Lukas's fellow band members from Promise of the Real.[131] Additionally, Young released a film in tandem to the album, (also entitled \"The Monsanto Years\"), that documents the album's recording, and can be streamed online.[132] In August 2019, The Guardian reported Young, among other environmental activists, was being spied on by the firm.[133]\nIn summer 2015, Young undertook a North America tour titled the Rebel Content Tour. The tour began on July 5, 2015 at the Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and ended on July 24, 2015 at the Wayhome Festival in Oro-Medonte, Ontario. Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real were special guests for the tour.[134][135][136][needs update] After a show on September 19, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois, the tour started over on October 1, 2015 in Missoula, Montana and ended on October 25, 2015 in Mountain View, California.[needs update]\nIn October 2016, Young performed at Desert Trip in Indio, California,[137][138] and announced his thirty-seventh studio album, Peace Trail, recorded with drummer Jim Keltner and bass guitarist Paul Bushnell,[139] which was released that December.\nOn September 8, 2017, Young released Hitchhiker, a studio LP recorded on August 11, 1976 at Indigo Studios in Malibu. The album features ten songs that Young recorded accompanied by acoustic guitar or piano.[140] While different versions of most of the songs have been previously released, the new album will include two never-before-released songs: \"Hawaii\" and \"Give Me Strength\", which Young has occasionally performed live.[141]\nOn July 4, 2017, Young released the song \"Children of Destiny\" which would appear on his next album. On November 3, 2017, Young released \"Already Great\" a song from The Visitor, an album he recorded with Promise of the Real and released on December 1, 2017.[142]\nOn December 1, 2017, Young performed live in Omemee, Ontario, Canada, a town he had lived in as a boy.[143]\nOn March 23, 2018, Young released a soundtrack album for the Daryl Hannah film Paradox. The album is labeled as \"Special Release Series, Volume 10.\"[citation needed]\nOn Record Store Day, April 21, 2018, Warner Records released a two-vinyl LP special edition of Roxy: Tonight's the Night Live, a double live album of a show that Young performed in September 1973 at the Roxy in West Hollywood, with the Santa Monica Flyers. The album is labeled as \"Volume 05\" in Young's Performance Series[citation needed]\nOn October 19, 2018, Young released a live version of his song \"Campaigner\", an excerpt from a forthcoming archival live album titled Songs for Judy, which features solo performances recorded during a November 1976 tour with Crazy Horse. It will be the first release from his new label Shakey Pictures Records.[144][145][146]\nIn November 2018, shortly after his home had been destroyed by the California wildfire, Young criticised President Donald Trump's stance on climate change.[147]\nIn December 2018, Young criticised the promoters of a London show for selecting Barclays Bank as a sponsor. Young objected to the bank's association with fossil fuels. Young explained that he was trying to rectify the situation by finding a different sponsor.[148]\nYoung revived Crazy Horse for a series of low-profile theater gigs beginning May 1, 2018 in Fresno, California.\nIn April 2019, the band began recording \"at least 11 new songs, all written recently\" for a new album titled Colorado.\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Neil Young among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[149]\nOn August 19, 2019, Neil Young and Crazy Horse announced the forthcoming release later in August 2019 of the new song \"Rainbow of Colors\", the first single from the forthcoming 10-track studio LP Colorado, Young's first new record with the band in seven years, since 2012's Psychedelic Pill. Young, multi-instrumentalist Nils Lofgren, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina recorded the new album with Neil's co-producer, John Hanlon, in spring 2019. The 10 new songs are ranging from around 3 minutes to over 13 minutes. Colorado is due to be released in October 2019[150][151] on Reprise Records. On August 30, 2019, Young unveiled \"Milky Way\", the first song from Colorado, a love ballad Young had performed several times at concerts over the past few months \u2013 both solo acoustic and with Promise of the Real.[152]\nAs far back as 1988, Young spoke in interviews of his efforts to compile his unreleased material and to remaster his existing catalogue. The collection was eventually titled the Neil Young Archives Series. The first installment, titled The Archives Vol. 1 1963\u20131972, was originally planned for a 2007 release but was delayed, and released on June 2, 2009.[citation needed]\nThree performances from the Performance Series of the archives were released individually before The Archives Vol. 1. Live at the Fillmore East, a selection of songs from a 1970 gig with Crazy Horse, was released in 2006. Live at Massey Hall 1971, a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, saw release in 2007. Sugar Mountain \u2013 Live at Canterbury House 1968, an early solo performance and, chronologically, the first disc in the performance series, emerged late in 2008.[citation needed]\nIn an interview in 2008, Young discussed Toast, an album originally recorded with Crazy Horse in San Francisco in 2000 but never released.[153] The album will be part of the Special Edition Series of the Archives. No release date currently exists for Toast. The album  A Treasure, with live tracks from a 1984\u201385 tour with the International Harvesters, during a time when he was being sued by Geffen Records, was released in June 2011.[citation needed]\nOn July 14, 2009, Young's first four solo albums were reissued as remastered HDCD discs and digital downloads as discs 1\u20134 of the Original Release Series of the Archives.[citation needed]\nAs of 2019, Neil Young has launched a subscription website and application where all of his music is available to stream in high resolution audio. The Neil Young Archives also include his newspaper, The Times-Contrarian, The Hearse Theater, and photos and memorabilia throughout his career.[154]\nYoung lives in Malibu, California, where his house burned to the ground in the 2018 Woolsey Fire.[155]\nPrior to his move to Santa Monica, he lived on Broken Arrow Ranch, a property of about 1,000 acres[156] near La Honda, California, that he purchased in 1970 for US$350,000 cash (US$2,304,242 in 2019 dollars[67]); the property was subsequently expanded to thousands of acres.[157][158]\nYoung married his first wife, restaurant owner Susan Acevedo, in December 1968. They were together until October 1970, when she filed for divorce.[159]\nFrom late 1970 to 1975, Young was in a relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress. The song \"A Man Needs a Maid\" from Harvest is inspired by his seeing her in the film Diary of a Mad Housewife. They met soon afterward and she moved in with him on his ranch in northern California. They have a son, Zeke, who was born September 8, 1972.[160]\nYoung met future wife Pegi Young (n\u00e9e Morton) in 1974 when she was working as a waitress at a diner near his ranch, a story he tells in the 1992 song \"Unknown Legend\". They married in August 1978[161] and had two children together, Ben and Amber. Both Ben and Zeke are diagnosed with cerebral palsy,[162] and Amber with epilepsy.[162] The couple were musical collaborators and co-founded the Bridge School in 1986.[163][164]\nOn July 29, 2014, Young filed for divorce after 36 years of marriage.[57] He has been in a relationship with actress and director Daryl Hannah since 2014.[165] Young and Hannah were reported to have wed on August 25, 2018 in Atascadero, California.[166] Young confirmed his marriage to Hannah in a video released on October 31, 2018.[167] Pegi died on January 1, 2019.[168]\nYoung has been widely reported to be the godfather of actress Amber Tamblyn;[169] in a 2009 interview with Parade, Tamblyn explained that \"godfather\" was \"just a loose term\" for Young, Dennis Hopper, and Dean Stockwell, three famous friends of her father, who were always around the house when she was growing up, and who were important influences on her life.[170]\nYoung is an environmentalist[171] and outspoken advocate for the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled LincVolt. The project involves his 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology as an environmentalist statement.[172][173] In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School,[174] an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his former wife Pegi Young.[175] The last concerts were held in October 2016. On June 14, 2017, Neil and Pegi Young announced that the Bridge School Concerts would no longer continue.\nYoung is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.[176]\n\nYoung was part owner of Lionel, LLC, a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories.[177] In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains,[177] and remains on the board of directors of Lionel.[2] He has been named as co-inventor on seven US patents related to model trains.[178]\nYoung has long held that the digital audio formats in which most people download music are deeply flawed, and do not provide the rich, warm sound of analog recordings. He is acutely aware of the difference and compares it with taking a shower in tiny ice cubes versus ordinary water.[179] Young and his company PonoMusic developed Pono, a music download service and dedicated music player focusing on \"high-quality\" uncompressed digital audio.[180] It is designed to compete against MP3 and other formats. Pono promised to present songs \"as they first sound during studio recording\".[181][182][183] The service and the selling of the player launched in October 2014.[184][185] In April 2017 it was announced that Pono was discontinued after the company that was running the store, Omnifone, was purchased by Apple in 2016 and almost immediately shut down. Alternative plans were later abandoned (although the Ponomusic website has remained \"under construction\" as of 2018.)\nIn 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young as eighty-third in its ranking of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" (although in a more recent version of the list, he has been moved up to seventeenth place), describing him as a \"restless experimenter\u00a0... who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory\".[186] Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he uses frequently just a few instruments, as is explained by his longtime guitar technician Larry Cragg in the film Neil Young: Heart of Gold. They include:\nOther notable (or odd) instruments played by Young include:\nYoung plays Hohner Marine Band harmonicas and is often seen using a harmonica holder[citation needed].[188]\nYoung owns a restored Estey reed organ, serial number 167272, dating from 1885, which he frequently plays in concert.[189]\nYoung owns a glass harmonica which is used in the recording of \"I do\" on the 2019 album Colorado.[190]\nYoung uses various vintage Fender Tweed Deluxe amplifiers. His preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. He purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for US$50 (US$383 in 2019 dollars[67]) from Sol Betnun Music on Larchmont in Hollywood and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it is the original model that sounds superior and is crucial to his trademark sound.[191]\nThe Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950s Magnatone 280 (similar to the amplifier used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on \"See the Sky About to Rain\". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an effects pedal. Tom Wheeler's book Soul of Tone highlights the device on page 182/183.[192]\nAs one of the original founders of Farm Aid (1985\u2013), he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in Mountain View, California, Young and his ex-wife have hosted the Bridge School Concerts, which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, The Who, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Tom Waits, Thom Yorke of Radiohead, R.E.M., Foo Fighters, Metallica, Pearl Jam, Sonic Youth, The Smashing Pumpkins, Paul McCartney and Dave Matthews. He announced in June 2017, however, that he would no longer host the concerts.[194]  The concerts are a benefit for the Bridge School, which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stemmed at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have cerebral palsy and his daughter, like Young himself, has epilepsy.\nYoung was nominated for an Oscar in 1994 for his song \"Philadelphia\" from the film Philadelphia. Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song \"Streets of Philadelphia\" from the same film. In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that \"the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song\". That same night, Tom Hanks, when accepting the Oscar for Best Actor, gave credit for his inspiration to Young's song.\nYoung has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an honorary doctorate of music from Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, in 1992, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from San Francisco State University in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School. In 2006, Young was given Manitoba's highest civilian honour when he was appointed to the Order of Manitoba. In 2009, he was appointed to Canada's second highest civilian order, the Order of Canada.\nRolling Stone magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time,[195] and in 2003, included five of his albums in its list of 500 greatest albums of all time.[196] In 2000, Young was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.[197]\nIn 2006, when Paste magazine compiled a \"Greatest Living Songwriters\" list, Young was ranked second behind Bob Dylan. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other's records.) He ranked thirty-ninth on VH1's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has \"avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young's peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.\"[83]\nYoung's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as Blind Melon, Phish, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. Young is referred to as \"the Godfather of Grunge\" because of the influence he had on Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the experimental rock group Sonic Youth, and Thom Yorke of Radiohead. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favourably compared his singing voice to Young's. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought After the Gold Rush (1970), and \"immediately fell in love\" with his work, calling it \"extraordinary\".[198] Yorke later covered the title track in concert. Dave Matthews lists Young as one of his favourite songwriters and most important inspirations and covers his songs on occasion. The British indie band The Bluetones named their number one debut album after the song \"Expecting to Fly\" (written by Young when still with Buffalo Springfield) and have covered the song while touring. Young also inspired the singer-songwriter Noel Gallagher of Oasis, who covered \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" on the live album Familiar to Millions (2000).\nThe Australian rock group Powderfinger named themselves after Young's song \"Powderfinger\" from Rust Never Sleeps (1979). The members of the Constantines have occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze.[199] While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008, during the Canadian leg of his tour, Bob Dylan visited Young's former home in River Heights, where Young spent his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Young's first songs were composed.\nJason Bond, an East Carolina University biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after Young,[200] his favourite singer.[201]\nIn 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award by the civil liberties group People for the American Way. Young was honoured as the MusiCares Person of the Year on January 29, 2010, two nights prior to the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. He was also nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for \"Fork in the Road\" and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package for Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 (1963\u20131972). Young won the latter Grammy Award. In 2010, he was ranked No.\u00a026 in Gibson.com's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.[202]\n</body></html>"
