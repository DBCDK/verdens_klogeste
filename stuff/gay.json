                "text": "no title\n\nJussie Smollett (/\u02c8d\u0292\u028csi/ JUSS-ee, born June 21, 1982) is an American actor and singer. He began his career as a child actor in 1987 acting in films including The Mighty Ducks (1992) and Rob Reiner's North (1994). In 2015, Smollett portrayed musician Jamal Lyon in the Fox drama series Empire, a role that was hailed as groundbreaking for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television. Smollett has also appeared in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Alien: Covenant (2017) as Ricks and in Marshall (2017) as Langston Hughes. Smollett was indicted on February 20, 2019 for disorderly conduct consisting of allegedly paying two Nigerian-American brothers to stage a fake hate crime assault on him and filing a false police report.[7] Smollett's defense team reached a deal with prosecutors on March 26, 2019, in which all charges were dropped in return for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.[8] On March 27, 2019, it was announced that the FBI would be investigating why the charges were dismissed.[9] Jussie Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California, the third of six children of Janet (n\u00e9e Harris) and Joel Smollett (1956\u20132014).[10] He has three brothers and two sisters: Jake, Jocqui, Jojo, Jurnee, and Jazz, several of whom are also actors.[11] Smollett is biracial;[12] his mother is African-American and his father was a Jewish man whose family emigrated from Russia and Poland.[13] He has said that his father would \"kill you if you called him white\". His father was absent from his life for a significant portion of his childhood.[14] He graduated from Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey.[15] Smollett told his parents he was gay when he was 19.[14] Smollett began his acting career as a child, appearing in the films The Mighty Ducks (1992) and Rob Reiner's North (1994). On television, he starred alongside his five real-life siblings in the short-lived ABC sitcom On Our Own from 1994\u20131995.[16] In 2012, Smollett returned to acting with the leading role in Patrik-Ian Polk's LGBT-themed comedy-drama The Skinny.[17] Also that year, he released an EP titled The Poisoned Hearts Club.[11][18] He later guest-starred on The Mindy Project (2012) and Revenge (2014).[14] In 2014, Smollett was cast as Jamal Lyon\u2014a gay musician who struggles to gain the approval of his father\u2014opposite Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard in the Fox drama series Empire.[19][20][21] His role was hailed as \"groundbreaking\" for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television.[22] Smollett reprised his role in subsequent seasons,[23] and directed an episode of the fourth season in 2017.[24] In February 2015, Smollett confirmed that he had signed a recording contract with Columbia Records and would be releasing an album in the future.[25] Smollett co-wrote the songs \"I Wanna Love You\" and \"You're So Beautiful\" on the Original Soundtrack from Season 1 of Empire album, which was released in March 2015.[26] In June 2015, it was announced that Smollett would guest-star alongside his younger sister, Jurnee, on Underground, which aired in 2016.[27] In March 2018, Smollett released his debut album, Sum of My Music.[28] Sum of My Music is an R&B album that features elements of electronic music and hip hop. Smollett self-released it through his own label, Music of Sound.[29] On April 30, 2019, it was announced that although Fox Entertainment had extended Smollett's contract for the sixth season of Empire, there were no plans for the character to appear during the season.[30][31] Smollett came out as gay during a televised interview with Ellen DeGeneres in March 2015.[32][33] In a 2016 interview with Out, he clarified his sexual orientation by stating, \"If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man.\" However, he stated his belief that openness to love is more important than gender, revealing that \"If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I'm going to love that woman.\"[14] When Smollett's gay character from Empire engaged in a tryst with a female character, Smollett defended the plot development by stating that he and Empire's creator Lee Daniels were trying to create a conversation about sexual fluidity in the gay community. Daniels has stated that while he and Smollett are gay, they both occasionally want to have sex with women. Daniels stated that \"We're showing life on Empire\", in that both he and Smollett were incorporating their own sexual fluidity as gay men into the show.[34] Smollett lives in Chicago.[35] According to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, Smollett pleaded no contest to providing false information to law enforcement in a 2007 misdemeanor case resulting from a DUI stop in which Smollett gave police a false name and signed his brother's name on the summons promising to appear in court.[36][37] Smollett also pleaded no contest to driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit and driving without a valid driver's license,[36] and was sentenced to a fine and two years of probation.[36] On January 29, 2019, Smollett told police that he was attacked outside his apartment building by two men in ski masks who called him racial and homophobic slurs, and said \"This is MAGA country\", referencing President Donald Trump's slogan \"Make America Great Again\"[38] and used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault.[39][40] According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the two suspects then \"poured an unknown liquid\" on Smollett and put a noose around his neck.[41] Smollett said that he fought them off. Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; not seriously injured, he was released \"in good condition\" later that morning.[38][42][43] The police were called after 2:30 am;[44] when they arrived around 2:40 am, Smollett had a white rope around his neck.[45] Smollett said that the attack may have been motivated by his criticism of the Trump administration[46] and that he believed that the alleged assault was linked to the threatening letter that was sent to him earlier that month.[37] On February 20, 2019, Smollett was charged by a grand jury with a class 4 felony for filing a false police report.[47][48][49] The next day, Smollett surrendered himself at the Chicago Police Department's Central Booking station.[50] Shortly thereafter, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi stated that Smollett \"is under arrest and in the custody of detectives\".[51] On March 26, 2019, all charges filed against Smollett were dropped, with Judge Steven Watkins ordering the public court file sealed.[8][52] First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats said the office reached a deal with Smollett's defense team in which prosecutors dropped the charges upon Smollett performing 16 hours of community service[53][54][55] and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.[56][57][58] On March 27, 2019, it was announced that the FBI would be investigating why the charges were dismissed.[9]",

He began his career as a child actor in 1987 acting in films including The Mighty Ducks (1992) and Rob Reiner's North (1994). In 2015, Smollett portrayed musician Jamal Lyon in the Fox drama series Empire, a role that was hailed as groundbreaking for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television. Smollett has also appeared in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Alien: Covenant (2017) as Ricks and in Marshall (2017) as Langston Hughes.\nSmollett was indicted on February 20, 2019 for disorderly conduct consisting of allegedly paying two Nigerian-American brothers to stage a fake hate crime assault on him and filing a false police report.[7] Smollett's defense team reached a deal with prosecutors on March 26, 2019, in which all charges were dropped in return for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.[8]  On March 27, 2019, it was announced that the FBI would be investigating why the charges were dismissed.[9]\nJussie Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California, the third of six children of Janet (n\u00e9e Harris) and Joel Smollett (1956\u20132014).[10] He has three brothers and two sisters: Jake, Jocqui, Jojo, Jurnee, and Jazz, several of whom are also actors.[11] Smollett is biracial;[12] his mother is African-American and his father was a Jewish man whose family emigrated from Russia and Poland.[13] He has said that his father would \"kill you if you called him white\". His father was absent from his life for a significant portion of his childhood.[14] He graduated from Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey.[15] Smollett told his parents he was gay when he was 19.[14]\nSmollett began his acting career as a child, appearing in the films The Mighty Ducks (1992) and Rob Reiner's North (1994). On television, he starred alongside his five real-life siblings in the short-lived ABC sitcom On Our Own from 1994\u20131995.[16] In 2012, Smollett returned to acting with the leading role in Patrik-Ian Polk's LGBT-themed comedy-drama The Skinny.[17] Also that year, he released an EP titled The Poisoned Hearts Club.[11][18] He later guest-starred on The Mindy Project (2012) and Revenge (2014).[14]\nIn 2014, Smollett was cast as Jamal Lyon\u2014a gay musician who struggles to gain the approval of his father\u2014opposite Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard in the Fox drama series Empire.[19][20][21] His role was hailed as \"groundbreaking\" for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television.[22] Smollett reprised his role in subsequent seasons,[23] and directed an episode of the fourth season in 2017.[24]\nIn February 2015, Smollett confirmed that he had signed a recording contract with Columbia Records and would be releasing an album in the future.[25] Smollett co-wrote the songs \"I Wanna Love You\" and \"You're So Beautiful\" on the Original Soundtrack from Season 1 of Empire album, which was released in March 2015.[26]\nIn June 2015, it was announced that Smollett would guest-star alongside his younger sister, Jurnee, on Underground, which aired in 2016.[27] In March 2018, Smollett released his debut album, Sum of My Music.[28] Sum of My Music is an R&amp;B album that features elements of electronic music and hip hop. Smollett self-released it through his own label, Music of Sound.[29]\nOn April 30, 2019, it was announced that although Fox Entertainment had extended Smollett's contract for the sixth season of Empire, there were no plans for the character to appear during the season.[30][31]\nSmollett came out as gay during a televised interview with Ellen DeGeneres in March 2015.[32][33]\nIn a 2016 interview with Out, he clarified his sexual orientation by stating, \"If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man.\" However, he stated his belief that openness to love is more important than gender, revealing that \"If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I'm going to love that woman.\"[14] When Smollett's gay character from Empire engaged in a tryst with a female character, Smollett defended the plot development by stating that he and Empire's creator Lee Daniels were trying to create a conversation about sexual fluidity in the gay community. Daniels has stated that while he and Smollett are gay, they both occasionally want to have sex with women. Daniels stated that \"We're showing life on Empire\", in that both he and Smollett were incorporating their own sexual fluidity as gay men into the show.[34]\nSmollett lives in Chicago.[35]\nAccording to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, Smollett pleaded no contest to providing false information to law enforcement in a 2007 misdemeanor case resulting from a DUI stop in which Smollett gave police a false name and signed his brother's name on the summons promising to appear in court.[36][37] Smollett also pleaded no contest to driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit and driving without a valid driver's license,[36] and was sentenced to a fine and two years of probation.[36]\nOn January 29, 2019, Smollett told police that he was attacked outside his apartment building by two men in ski masks who called him racial and homophobic slurs, and said \"This is MAGA country\", referencing President Donald Trump's slogan \"Make America Great Again\"[38] and used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault.[39][40] According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the two suspects then \"poured an unknown liquid\" on Smollett and put a noose around his neck.[41] Smollett said that he fought them off. Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; not seriously injured, he was released \"in good condition\" later that morning.[38][42][43] The police were called after 2:30 am;[44] when they arrived around 2:40 am, Smollett had a white rope around his neck.[45] Smollett said that the attack may have been motivated by his criticism of the Trump administration[46] and that he believed that the alleged assault was linked to the threatening letter that was sent to him earlier that month.[37]\nOn February 20, 2019, Smollett was charged by a grand jury with a class 4 felony for filing a false police report.[47][48][49] The next day, Smollett surrendered himself at the Chicago Police Department's Central Booking station.[50] Shortly thereafter, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi stated that Smollett \"is under arrest and in the custody of detectives\".[51] On March 26, 2019, all charges filed against Smollett were dropped, with Judge Steven Watkins ordering the public court file sealed.[8][52] First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats said the office reached a deal with Smollett's defense team in which prosecutors dropped the charges upon Smollett performing 16 hours of community service[53][54][55] and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.[56][57][58] On March 27, 2019, it was announced that the FBI would be investigating why the charges were dismissed.[9]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nSir Ian Murray McKellen CH CBE (born 25 May 1939) is an English actor. His career spans genres ranging from Shakespearean and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction. He is the recipient of six Laurence Olivier Awards, a Tony Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BIF Award, two Saturn Awards, four Drama Desk Awards, and two Critics' Choice Awards. He has also received nominations for two Academy Awards, five Primetime Emmy Awards, and four BAFTAs. He achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in Richard III (1995), James Whale in Gods and Monsters (1998), Magneto in the X-Men films, and Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. The BBC states that his \"performances have guaranteed him a place in the canon of English stage and film actors\".[2][3] A recipient of every major theatrical award in the UK, McKellen is regarded as a British cultural icon.[4][5] He started his professional career in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of their highly regarded repertory company. In 1965, McKellen made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's Richard II and Marlowe's Edward II, and he firmly established himself as one of the country's foremost classical actors. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain. McKellen was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1979 Birthday Honours, was knighted in the 1991 New Year Honours for services to the performing arts, and made a Companion of Honour for services to drama and to equality in the 2008 New Year Honours.[6][7][8][9] He has been openly gay since 1988, and continues to be a champion for LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded Freedom of the City of London in October 2014.[10] McKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire,[11][12] the son of Margery Lois (n\u00e9e Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.[13] Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951, after his father had been promoted.[13][14] The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that \"only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal.\"[14] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: \"Well, darling, you forget\u2014I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old.\u201d[15] McKellen's father was a civil engineer[16] and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent.[17] Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a \"strict, evangelical Protestant minister\" in Ballymena, County Antrim.[18] His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. \"My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met.\"[19] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 24. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a member of the Religious Society of Friends, he said, \"Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore.\"[20] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a \"grandfather of the modern weekend\".[21] McKellen attended Bolton School (Boys' Division),[22] of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron.[23] An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.[13] When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.[13] His sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, Twelfth Night,[24] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their Macbeth and Wigan High School for Girls' production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[25] In 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.[26] He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the College. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in Henry IV alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), Cymbeline (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and Doctor Faustus.[27][28][29] During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a huge impact on McKellen's future career. McKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre, as Roper in A Man for All Seasons, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's Cymbeline had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[27][29] After four years in regional repertory theatres he made his first West End appearance, in A Scent of Flowers, regarded as a \"notable success\".[27] In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Richard II (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Marlowe's Edward II (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.[30] In the 1970s and 1980s McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles, including the title role in Macbeth (which he had first played for Trevor Nunn in a \"gripping...out of the ordinary\" production, with Judi Dench, at Stratford in 1976), and Iago in Othello, in award-winning productions directed by Nunn.[27] Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn. In 2007 he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of King Lear and The Seagull, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he appeared in a very popular revival of Waiting for Godot at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart.[31][32] He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.[33] In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from The Tempest.[34] In October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his \"last big Shakespearean part\".[35] He performed the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End during the summer of 2018.[36][37] McKellen had taken film roles throughout his career\u2014beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in A Touch of Love, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in Priest of Love,[38] but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films.[26] In 1993, he had a supporting role as a South African tycoon in the critically acclaimed[39] Six Degrees of Separation, in which he starred with Stockard Channing, Donald Sutherland, and Will Smith. In the same year, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries Tales of the City, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin, and the film Last Action Hero, in which he briefly played Death opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger and Charles Dance. Later in 1993, McKellen appeared in the television film And the Band Played On about the discovery of the AIDS virus for which McKellen won a CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.[40] In 1995, he played the title role in Richard III,[41] which transported the setting into an alternative 1930s in which England is ruled by fascists. The film was a critical success.[42] McKellen co-produced and co-wrote the film, adapting the play for the screen based on a stage production of Shakespeare's play directed by Richard Eyre for the Royal National Theatre in which McKellen had appeared.[26][42] As executive producer he returned his \u00a350,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle.[43] In his review of the film, The Washington Post film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen's performance a \"lethally flamboyant incarnation\" and said his \"florid mastery ... dominates everything\".[44] His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He appeared in the modestly acclaimed film[45] Apt Pupil, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King. McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. He was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the 1998 film Gods and Monsters, wherein he played James Whale, the director of Show Boat (1936) and Frankenstein.[26] In 1999 McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film X-Men and its sequels X2: X-Men United (2003) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).[26] He later made a short appearance as an older Magneto in 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011's X-Men: First Class.[46] While filming the first X-Men film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson's three-film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings (consisting of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003) ). He received honors from the Screen Actors Guild for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in The Fellowship of the Ring and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the Lord of the Rings films,[47] then reprised the role on screen in Jackson's film adaptation of The Hobbit, which was released in three parts from 2012 to 2014.[48] On 16 March 2002, he hosted Saturday Night Live. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show The Simpsons in a special British-themed episode entitled \"The Regina Monologues\", along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television's long running British soap opera, Coronation Street, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. He narrated Richard Bell's film Eighteen as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson. McKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot),[49] Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.[50] McKellen responded, \"I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie\u2014not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story.\" He continued, \"And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it\".[50] McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor \u2013 Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner.[51] In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. On 23 August 2013 the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015.[52][53] In November 2013, McKellen appeared in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary comedy homage The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot.[54] In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins' Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's The Dresser, alongside Edward Fox and Emily Watson.[55] In 2017, McKellen portrayed Cogsworth in the live-action adaptation of Disney's Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after Gods and Monsters and Mr. Holmes) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens.[56] Also that year, McKellen appeared in the documentary McKellen: Playing the Part, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen's life and career as an actor. In 2019, McKellen starred in The Good Liar with Helen Mirren,[57] and additionally played Gus the Theatre Cat in Cats, an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, directed by Tom Hooper, and also featuring Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench.[58] McKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964.[59] Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse.[60] In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends with Mathias later directing McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.[61] McKellen is an atheist.[62] In the late 1980s, McKellen lost his appetite for meat except for fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.[63] In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).[64] He has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien's constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the Lord of the Rings and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies, whose character was also one of the original nine companions, arranged for his stunt double to get the tattoo instead.[65] He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.[66] In 2012, McKellen stated on his blog that \"There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I've not needed any treatment.\"[67] He became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013[68] in order to preside over the marriage of his friend and X-Men co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.[69] McKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014.[70] He was made a Freeman of the city of London on Thursday 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. McKellen was nominated by London's Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was chosen as he was an \"exceptional actor\" and \"tireless campaigner for equality\".[71] He is also an Emeritus Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.[72] While McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio.[73] The context that prompted McKellen's decision\u2014overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career\u2014was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament.[26] Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality \"... as a kind of pretended family relationship\".[74] McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay.[26][75] McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin.[26] In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.[76] He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.[19] Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland. In 2003, during an appearance on Have I Got News For You, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, \"Fuck off, I'm gay.\"[77] McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Dame Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.[78] McKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented that: I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about\u2014nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.[79] McKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[80] McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month,[81] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation,[82] and FFLAG where he appears in their video \"Parents Talking\".[83] In 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, \"I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena\": This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.[19] In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade[84] and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.[81] In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.[80] In 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.[85]McKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended.[86] In December 2008, he was named in Out's annual Out 100 list.[87] In 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool's Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.[88] In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, a \"coward\" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.[89] In 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.[90] In April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.[91] A cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[92][93] McKellen is an honorary board member for the New York and Washington, DC based organization Only Make Believe.[94] Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012[95] and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013.[96] He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping down to his Lord of the Rings underwear on stage. McKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming The Hobbit in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour \"Shakespeare, Tolkien, and You!\", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (Waiting for Godot in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.[97] In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.[98] A friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to For Ian Charleson: A Tribute.[99] A recording of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum.[100][101] He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's The Tempest.[34]",

His career spans genres ranging from Shakespearean and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction.\nHe is the recipient of six Laurence Olivier Awards, a Tony Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BIF Award, two Saturn Awards, four Drama Desk Awards, and two Critics' Choice Awards. He has also received nominations for two Academy Awards, five Primetime Emmy Awards, and four BAFTAs.\nHe achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in Richard III (1995), James Whale in Gods and Monsters (1998), Magneto in the X-Men films, and Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.\nThe BBC states that his \"performances have guaranteed him a place in the canon of English stage and film actors\".[2][3] A recipient of every major theatrical award in the UK, McKellen is regarded as a British cultural icon.[4][5] He started his professional career in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of their highly regarded repertory company. In 1965, McKellen made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's Richard II and Marlowe's Edward II, and he firmly established himself as one of the country's foremost classical actors. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain.\nMcKellen was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1979 Birthday Honours, was knighted in the 1991 New Year Honours for services to the performing arts, and made a Companion of Honour for services to drama and to equality in the 2008 New Year Honours.[6][7][8][9] He has been openly gay since 1988, and continues to be a champion for LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded Freedom of the City of London in October 2014.[10]\nMcKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire,[11][12] the son of Margery Lois (n\u00e9e Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.[13] Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951, after his father had been promoted.[13][14] The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that \"only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal.\"[14] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: \"Well, darling, you forget\u2014I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old.\u201d[15]\nMcKellen's father was a civil engineer[16] and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent.[17] Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a \"strict, evangelical Protestant minister\" in Ballymena, County Antrim.[18] His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. \"My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met.\"[19] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 24. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a member of the Religious Society of Friends, he said, \"Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore.\"[20] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a \"grandfather of the modern weekend\".[21]\nMcKellen attended Bolton School (Boys' Division),[22] of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron.[23] An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.[13] When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.[13]\nHis sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, Twelfth Night,[24] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their Macbeth and Wigan High School for Girls' production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[25]\nIn 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.[26] He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the College. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in Henry IV alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), Cymbeline (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and Doctor Faustus.[27][28][29] During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a huge impact on McKellen's future career.\nMcKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre, as Roper in A Man for All Seasons, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's Cymbeline had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[27][29]\nAfter four years in regional repertory theatres he made his first West End appearance, in A Scent of Flowers, regarded as a \"notable success\".[27] In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Richard II (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Marlowe's Edward II (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.[30]\nIn the 1970s and 1980s McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles, including the title role in Macbeth (which he had first played for Trevor Nunn in a \"gripping...out of the ordinary\" production, with Judi Dench, at Stratford in 1976), and Iago in Othello, in award-winning productions directed by Nunn.[27] Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn.\nIn 2007 he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of King Lear and The Seagull, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he appeared in a very popular revival of Waiting for Godot at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart.[31][32] He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.[33] In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from The Tempest.[34]\nIn October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his \"last big Shakespearean part\".[35] He performed the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End during the summer of 2018.[36][37]\nMcKellen had taken film roles throughout his career\u2014beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in A Touch of Love, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in Priest of Love,[38] but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films.[26] In 1993, he had a supporting role as a South African tycoon in the critically acclaimed[39] Six Degrees of Separation, in which he starred with Stockard Channing, Donald Sutherland, and Will Smith. In the same year, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries Tales of the City, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin, and the film Last Action Hero, in which he briefly played Death opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger and Charles Dance.\nLater in 1993, McKellen appeared in the television film And the Band Played On about the discovery of the AIDS virus for which McKellen won a CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.[40] In 1995, he played the title role in Richard III,[41] which transported the setting into an alternative 1930s in which England is ruled by fascists. The film was a critical success.[42] McKellen co-produced and co-wrote the film, adapting the play for the screen based on a stage production of Shakespeare's play directed by Richard Eyre for the Royal National Theatre in which McKellen had appeared.[26][42] As executive producer he returned his \u00a350,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle.[43] In his review of the film, The Washington Post film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen's performance a \"lethally flamboyant incarnation\" and said his \"florid mastery ... dominates everything\".[44] His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\nHe appeared in the modestly acclaimed film[45] Apt Pupil, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King. McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. He was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the 1998 film Gods and Monsters, wherein he played James Whale, the director of Show Boat (1936) and Frankenstein.[26]\nIn 1999 McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film X-Men and its sequels X2: X-Men United (2003) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).[26] He later made a short appearance as an older Magneto in 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011's X-Men: First Class.[46]\nWhile filming the first X-Men film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson's three-film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings (consisting of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003) ). He received honors from the Screen Actors Guild for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in The Fellowship of the Ring and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the Lord of the Rings films,[47] then reprised the role on screen in Jackson's film adaptation of The Hobbit, which was released in three parts from 2012 to 2014.[48]\nOn 16 March 2002, he hosted Saturday Night Live. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show The Simpsons in a special British-themed episode entitled \"The Regina Monologues\", along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television's long running British soap opera, Coronation Street, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. He narrated Richard Bell's film Eighteen as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson.\nMcKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot),[49] Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.[50] McKellen responded, \"I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie\u2014not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story.\" He continued, \"And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it\".[50] McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor \u2013 Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner.[51] In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. On 23 August 2013 the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015.[52][53]\nIn November 2013, McKellen appeared in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary comedy homage The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot.[54] In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins' Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's The Dresser, alongside Edward Fox and Emily Watson.[55] In 2017, McKellen portrayed Cogsworth in the live-action adaptation of Disney's Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after Gods and Monsters and Mr. Holmes) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens.[56] Also that year, McKellen appeared in the documentary McKellen: Playing the Part, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen's life and career as an actor.\nIn 2019, McKellen starred in The Good Liar with Helen Mirren,[57] and additionally played Gus the Theatre Cat in Cats, an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, directed by Tom Hooper, and also featuring Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench.[58]\nMcKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964.[59] Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse.[60] In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends with Mathias later directing McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.[61]\nMcKellen is an atheist.[62] In the late 1980s, McKellen lost his appetite for meat except for fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.[63] In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).[64]\nHe has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien's constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the Lord of the Rings and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies, whose character was also one of the original nine companions, arranged for his stunt double to get the tattoo instead.[65]\nHe was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.[66] In 2012, McKellen stated on his blog that \"There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I've not needed any treatment.\"[67]\nHe became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013[68] in order to preside over the marriage of his friend and X-Men co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.[69]\nMcKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014.[70] He was made a Freeman of the city of London on Thursday 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. McKellen was nominated by London's Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was chosen as he was an \"exceptional actor\" and \"tireless campaigner for equality\".[71] He is also an Emeritus Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.[72]\n\nWhile McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio.[73] The context that prompted McKellen's decision\u2014overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career\u2014was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament.[26] Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality \"... as a kind of pretended family relationship\".[74] McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay.[26][75] McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin.[26] In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.[76] He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.[19] Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.\nIn 2003, during an appearance on Have I Got News For You, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, \"Fuck off, I'm gay.\"[77] McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Dame Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.[78]\nMcKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented that:\nI have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about\u2014nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.[79]\nMcKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[80] McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month,[81] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation,[82] and FFLAG where he appears in their video \"Parents Talking\".[83]\nIn 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, \"I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena\": This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.[19] In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade[84] and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.[81] In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.[80]\n\nIn 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.[85]McKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended.[86] In December 2008, he was named in Out's annual Out 100 list.[87]\nIn 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool's Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.[88] In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, a \"coward\" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.[89]\nIn 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.[90]\nIn April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.[91]\nA cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[92][93]\nMcKellen is an honorary board member for the New York and Washington, DC based organization Only Make Believe.[94] Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012[95] and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013.[96] He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping down to his Lord of the Rings underwear on stage.\nMcKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming The Hobbit in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour \"Shakespeare, Tolkien, and You!\", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (Waiting for Godot in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.[97] In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.[98]\nA friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to For Ian Charleson: A Tribute.[99] A recording of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum.[100][101] He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's The Tempest.[34]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRuby Rose Langenheim (born 20 March 1986) is an Australian model, actress, and television presenter. Rose came to attention as a presenter on MTV Australia (2007\u20132011), followed by several high-profile modelling gigs, notably as the face of Maybelline New York in Australia. In addition, she has co-hosted various television shows, most notably Australia's Next Top Model (2009) and The Project on Network Ten (2009\u20132011). Rose pursued a career in acting from 2008 onwards. She had a small role in the drama Around the Block (2013), and came to global attention for her role in season three of the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black (2015\u201316). She also had large roles in the action films Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016), XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and co-starred in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) and the monster film The Meg (2018). She currently stars in the Arrowverse television series Batwoman as Kate Kane / Batwoman. Rose was born in Melbourne,[1] the daughter of Katia Langenheim,[2] a 20-year-old single mother and artist, whom she describes as one of her role models.[3] As a young child, she travelled frequently, living in rural Victoria, Tasmania, and Surfers Paradise before finally settling in Melbourne.[4] As a teenager, she attended University High School and Footscray City College.[5] Rose is the goddaughter of Indigenous Australian boxer Lionel Rose and the great-granddaughter of Alec Campbell, who was the last surviving Australian Battle of Gallipoli soldier.[6] Rose first joined the Girlfriend model search in 2002, for which she came in second to Catherine McNeil.[6] In 2010, she collaborated with the Australian fashion label Milk and Honey to design a capsule fashion line. The collection, named Milk and Honey Designed by Ruby Rose,[7] includes washed jeans, leather jackets and T-shirts. The clothing line was available in selected retailers in Australia. Rose also released a collaboration collection with street footwear brand Gallaz. In 2014, Rose began collaborating with Phoebe Dahl for their clothing range Faircloth Lane. She has featured predominantly within mainstream fashion titles, including Vogue Australia, InStyle Magazine, Marie Claire Magazine, Cleo, Cosmopolitan, Maxim, Nylon and New York's Inked Magazine.

Whether they want someone a little bit skinnier, a little bit taller, a little bit prettier, but MTV wants you to be yourself ... not censoring anything and not conforming to anything\".[6] In 2009, Rose won the ASTRA Award for Favourite Female Personality.[11] She also travelled to Kenya to \"highlight ... [the] amazing work\" done by Global Vision International.[4] She appeared in the episode \"Media Virgins\", of Australia's Next Top Model, acting as a guest judge,[12] and also worked as a correspondent for the finale of Australia's Next Top Model.[13] In July 2009, Rose along with Dave Hughes, Charlie Pickering, Carrie Bickmore and James Mathison hosted The 7pm Project, an Australian television news talk show produced by Roving Enterprises which airs weeknights on Network Ten.[14] She left the program to pursue her own hosting projects. In October 2009, it was announced that FOX8 had picked up the rights to UK format Ultimate School Musical,[15] which features ordinary teenagers from a school attempting to put on a music production to a professional standard in just six weeks. The Australian version was produced by FremantleMedia Australia with Rose as host,[16] and aired in 2010. Rose also hosted the Foxtel Mardi Gras for 3 consecutive years before becoming an official correspondent for Foxtel for the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. In October 2015, Rose hosted the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards alongside Ed Sheeran in Milan. Rose appeared on the first episode of Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation, representing Generation M alongside comedian Josh Thomas.[17] She was selected in 2008 to act in the Australian comedy film Suite for Fleur.[18][19] She also appeared alongside Christina Ricci and Jack Thompson in the 2013 film Around the Block. Rose credits her 2014 short film Break Free, which she produced herself, for the success of her acting career. In an interview with Variety, she describes how she was not able to get a manager, agent, or audition, so she decided to create short films \"as a way of being able to give myself something to do and to study my craft.\" The film went viral, getting millions of views in a short period of time.[20] In 2015, Rose joined the Orange Is the New Black cast in season 3. Rose played inmate Stella Carlin, \"whose sarcastic sense of humor and captivating looks quickly draw the attention of some of Litchfield's inmates.\"[21][22] Rose's performance was generally well-received by the public.[23] She was also cast in a guest role, as the service robot Wendy, in the science fiction series Dark Matter.[24] In 2016, Rose and Tom Felton lent their voices to the animated title Sheep & Wolves, with Rose as fianc\u00e9 Bianca. In 2016 and 2017, Rose appeared in three action film sequels, XXX: Return of Xander Cage, alongside Vin Diesel, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter as Abigail, and John Wick: Chapter 2, alongside Keanu Reeves; she also played a musical rival in the comedy Pitch Perfect 3, which was released in December 2017.[25] Rose co-starred in the Warner Bros. film The Meg, a shark epic based on the novel of the same name, alongside Jason Statham; the film was released on 10 August 2018.[26] On 7 August 2018, it was reported that Rose had been cast as Batwoman in the upcoming Arrowverse crossover.[27] Her role has been noted as the first openly lesbian lead superhero in television.[28] Batwoman is in production as a stand-alone series on The CW as well, to air in late 2019.[29][30] Rose's casting as Batwoman was met by backlash on social media and generated intense criticism.[31][32] DC Comics, which owns the rights to the longtime comic book superheroine Batwoman, reintroduced the character in 2006 as a lesbian of Jewish descent. Some online commenters criticized Rose for not being Jewish, while the main focus of the scrutiny was the assertion that the fact she identifies as genderfluid made her \"not gay enough\" for the role.[31] Much of the reaction centered around the hashtag #RecastBatwoman, with commenters insisting that actress Ashley Platz from\u00a0Big Legend was more deserving of part.[32] Ruby Rose quit Twitter and deactivated public commenting on her Instagram account following the backlash.[31] Prior to leaving Twitter, Rose released a few final tweets responding to the negative reaction.[33][31] She stated, \"Where on earth did 'Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can\u2019t be batwoman' come from \u2014 has to be the funniest most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever read.\"[33] Rose called for unity between women and minorities, imploring women and the LGBT community to be kinder and more supportive of each other.[33] Rose will also star in the action comedy Three Sisters.[34] In January 2012, Rose released her first single \"Guilty Pleasure\" with Gary Go. In November 2016, Rose released and directed The Veronicas' single \"On Your Side\".[35] She is a supporter of many charities, won a charity boxing match,[36] and has travelled to Laos and Africa to volunteer each year. Issues of concern to her include animal welfare, campaigns for anti-bullying and youth mental health, where she works as an ambassador for Headspace. Known for being extensively tattooed, she showed off her tattoos in a photo spread for Maxim Australia and PETA, as part of the campaign \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\".[37][38] Rose came out as a lesbian at the age of 12.[39] Because of her sexuality, she suffered verbal taunts and physical abuse from her schoolmates, which led to a suicide attempt.[39] She was also sexually abused as a child by a relative,[40] and has bipolar disorder and clinical depression.[39] With regard to childhood gender nonconformity, Rose said she wanted to be a boy while growing up and that she was saving up money to physically transition from female to male.[41][42] She said, \"It was in my mind as something I wanted to do and then I just... didn't. I guess I grew out of it. I even used to sleep on my front because I didn't want to get boobs ever, which I think worked actually.\"[42] She stated that modelling led her to discover androgyny, and allowed her to model with different gender expressions. She recalled, \"I remember being at a yum cha restaurant with my dad and the owner coming up and saying, 'Excuse me, we're trying to work out if you're a handsome boy or a beautiful girl.' It was a compliment and I was shocked, and when I thought about it I actually wanted to be a handsome boy.\"[43] Rose is genderfluid, saying, \"I am very gender fluid and feel more like I wake up every day sort of gender neutral.\"[44] This announcement came approximately a week after she released Break Free, in which she visually transforms from a very feminine woman to a heavily tattooed man. Rose stated, however, that she prefers to continue using feminine pronouns.[45] While if she had to choose a sex, she commented that she would choose to be male, she does not feel like she should have been born with different body parts. Seeing the desire her transgender friends had for transitioning, she asked herself if her need to transition matched theirs, and concluded that she is satisfied being gender neutral. \"I think at this stage I will stay a woman but ... who knows. I'm so comfortable right now I feel wonderful about it, but I also fluctuate a lot,\" she added.[41] In 2014, Rose announced her engagement to fashion designer Phoebe Dahl; in December 2015, they ended their romantic relationship.[46][47] Rose was in a relationship with singer Jess Origliasso of The Veronicas from October 2016 to April 2018,[48] having previously dated in 2008.[49] Rose is a vegan; she suggested that people who want to help address climate change should consider what they are eating.[50] In 2019, Rose underwent emergency back surgery for a spine issue that led to two herniated discs caused by her work on a film set doing physical stunts. She said if she did not have the surgery, she was at risk of being paralyzed.[51] Various media outlets have commented on public fascination with Rose's gender identity, gender expression, and physical appearance, including her tattoos and visual or behavioral similarities to Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber, and a younger Leonardo DiCaprio.[52][53][54] In 2008 and 2009, she was chosen as one of the \"25 Most Influential Gay and Lesbian Australians\" by SameSame, an Australian online gay and lesbian community.[55] The public and media attention increased following Rose's debut on Orange Is the New Black, significantly with regard to heterosexual women commenting on her physical appearance.[52][56] During 2015, she was the fifth most searched person on Google.[57] PETA named her one of three \"Sexiest Vegans\" of 2017.[58] Emma Teitel of Maclean's stated, \"Rose [...] resembles an androgynous Angelina Jolie; she is a rare combination of angular and soft. She is a badass with a permanently arched brow and a Justin Bieber haircut. In other words, she is the lesbian James Dean. And straight women are falling madly in love with her.\"[56] Alex Rees of Cosmopolitan said that everyone was enamored of Rose at the time of her season three appearance on Orange Is the New Black.[59] The media attention resulted in a new, open discourse about sexual fluidity and whether or not sexual orientation can change, with some of the media expressing disapproval toward heterosexual women stating that they would \"go gay for Ruby Rose.\"[56][59] Teitel wrote that many on Twitter expressed skepticism that all it takes is a pretty face to change sexual orientation, and this was accompanied by the argument that saying \"you [can] 'go gay' for Ruby Rose reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice, and is homophobic.\" She felt that it was predictable and ironic that the people most eager to admonish others for expressing their attraction to Rose were a part of the LGBT community, and cited a Jezebel article which commented that homosexuality and bisexuality are not simply identities to show off liberalism, but are rather \"built into a person's biology.\" To Teitel, this response suggested that \"one must either reject the norm (heterosexuality) or embrace it full force.\" She felt the discussion was a wasted opportunity for sexual exploration, which she believes is \"a lot less daunting when labels are malleable,\" and emphasized the idea of \"letting everyone define their sexuality on their own terms.\"[56] Rose acknowledged the public discourse concerning her physical appearance and subsequent debate on sexual fluidity, commenting that, while she thought it was brilliant and was not expecting it, some of her friends found the public affection toward her inappropriate: \"They personally are offended by it, [and are] saying like, 'You can't just choose to be gay. You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.[59] In Entertainment Weekly's 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series Batwoman.[60] She stated that the opportunity to audition for Orange Is the New Black came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in Batwoman, I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman \u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"[60]",

Rose came to attention as a presenter on MTV Australia (2007\u20132011), followed by several high-profile modelling gigs, notably as the face of Maybelline New York in Australia. In addition, she has co-hosted various television shows, most notably Australia's Next Top Model (2009) and The Project on Network Ten (2009\u20132011).\nRose pursued a career in acting from 2008 onwards. She had a small role in the drama Around the Block (2013), and came to global attention for her role in season three of the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black (2015\u201316). She also had large roles in the action films Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016), XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and co-starred in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) and the monster film The Meg (2018). She currently stars in the Arrowverse television series Batwoman as Kate Kane / Batwoman.\nRose was born in Melbourne,[1] the daughter of Katia Langenheim,[2] a 20-year-old single mother and artist, whom she describes as one of her role models.[3] As a young child, she travelled frequently, living in rural Victoria, Tasmania, and Surfers Paradise before finally settling in Melbourne.[4] As a teenager, she attended University High School and Footscray City College.[5] Rose is the goddaughter of Indigenous Australian boxer Lionel Rose and the great-granddaughter of Alec Campbell, who was the last surviving Australian Battle of Gallipoli soldier.[6]\nRose first joined the Girlfriend model search in 2002, for which she came in second to Catherine McNeil.[6] In 2010, she collaborated with the Australian fashion label Milk and Honey to design a capsule fashion line. The collection, named Milk and Honey Designed by Ruby Rose,[7] includes washed jeans, leather jackets and T-shirts. The clothing line was available in selected retailers in Australia. Rose also released a collaboration collection with street footwear brand Gallaz.\nIn 2014, Rose began collaborating with Phoebe Dahl for their clothing range Faircloth Lane. She has featured predominantly within mainstream fashion titles, including Vogue Australia, InStyle Magazine, Marie Claire Magazine, Cleo, Cosmopolitan, Maxim, Nylon and New York's Inked Magazine. She's been the Australian ambassador for JVC, Australian clothes company JAG and luxury Danish label Georg Jensen. Rose is the face of Maybelline New York in Australia.\nSince March 2016, Rose has been the face of Urban Decay Cosmetics.[8]\nIn March 2017, Rose starred in Nike's latest campaign \"Kiss My Airs\" celebrating its Air Max Day.[9] In May, Rose was the face of Swarovski 'Urban Fantasy' FW17 Collection launch.[10]\nIn order to land her job as an MTV VJ in Australia, Rose competed against 2000 other hopefuls in a three-week national search, as former VJ Lyndsey Rodrigues moved to the United States to co-host TRL.[6] As part of the competition, she downed 100 shots of beer in 100 minutes against Jackass's Bam Margera, and kissed strangers on a busy Sydney street.[6] However, she enjoyed her job as a VJ compared to her previous job as a model. \"Being a model there is always something they want to change. Whether they want someone a little bit skinnier, a little bit taller, a little bit prettier, but MTV wants you to be yourself ... not censoring anything and not conforming to anything\".[6]\nIn 2009, Rose won the ASTRA Award for Favourite Female Personality.[11] She also travelled to Kenya to \"highlight ... [the] amazing work\" done by Global Vision International.[4] She appeared in the episode \"Media Virgins\", of Australia's Next Top Model, acting as a guest judge,[12] and also worked as a correspondent for the finale of Australia's Next Top Model.[13]\nIn July 2009, Rose along with Dave Hughes, Charlie Pickering, Carrie Bickmore and James Mathison hosted The 7pm Project, an Australian television news talk show produced by Roving Enterprises which airs weeknights on Network Ten.[14] She left the program to pursue her own hosting projects. In October 2009, it was announced that FOX8 had picked up the rights to UK format Ultimate School Musical,[15] which features ordinary teenagers from a school attempting to put on a music production to a professional standard in just six weeks. The Australian version was produced by FremantleMedia Australia with Rose as host,[16] and aired in 2010. Rose also hosted the Foxtel Mardi Gras for 3 consecutive years before becoming an official correspondent for Foxtel for the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. In October 2015, Rose hosted the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards alongside Ed Sheeran in Milan.\nRose appeared on the first episode of Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation, representing Generation M alongside comedian Josh Thomas.[17] She was selected in 2008 to act in the Australian comedy film Suite for Fleur.[18][19] She also appeared alongside Christina Ricci and Jack Thompson in the 2013 film Around the Block.\nRose credits her 2014 short film Break Free, which she produced herself, for the success of her acting career. In an interview with Variety, she describes how she was not able to get a manager, agent, or audition, so she decided to create short films \"as a way of being able to give myself something to do and to study my craft.\" The film went viral, getting millions of views in a short period of time.[20]\nIn 2015, Rose joined the Orange Is the New Black cast in season 3. Rose played inmate Stella Carlin, \"whose sarcastic sense of humor and captivating looks quickly draw the attention of some of Litchfield's inmates.\"[21][22] Rose's performance was generally well-received by the public.[23] She was also cast in a guest role, as the service robot Wendy, in the science fiction series Dark Matter.[24]\nIn 2016, Rose and Tom Felton lent their voices to the animated title Sheep &amp; Wolves, with Rose as fianc\u00e9 Bianca.\nIn 2016 and 2017, Rose appeared in three action film sequels, XXX: Return of Xander Cage, alongside Vin Diesel, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter as Abigail, and John Wick: Chapter 2, alongside Keanu Reeves; she also played a musical rival in the comedy Pitch Perfect 3, which was released in December 2017.[25]\nRose co-starred in the Warner Bros. film The Meg, a shark epic based on the novel of the same name, alongside Jason Statham; the film was released on 10 August 2018.[26]\nOn 7 August 2018, it was reported that Rose had been cast as Batwoman in the upcoming Arrowverse crossover.[27] Her role has been noted as the first openly lesbian lead superhero in television.[28] Batwoman is in production as a stand-alone series on The CW as well, to air in late 2019.[29][30] Rose's casting as Batwoman was met by backlash on social media and generated intense criticism.[31][32] DC Comics, which owns the rights to the longtime comic book superheroine Batwoman, reintroduced the character in 2006 as a lesbian of Jewish descent. Some online commenters criticized Rose for not being Jewish, while the main focus of the scrutiny was the assertion that the fact she identifies as genderfluid made her \"not gay enough\" for the role.[31] Much of the reaction centered around the hashtag #RecastBatwoman, with commenters insisting that actress Ashley Platz from\u00a0Big Legend was more deserving of part.[32] Ruby Rose quit Twitter and deactivated public commenting on her Instagram account following the backlash.[31] Prior to leaving Twitter, Rose released a few final tweets responding to the negative reaction.[33][31] She stated, \"Where on earth did 'Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can\u2019t be batwoman' come from \u2014 has to be the funniest most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever read.\"[33] Rose called for unity between women and minorities, imploring women and the LGBT community to be kinder and more supportive of each other.[33]\nRose will also star in the action comedy Three Sisters.[34]\nIn January 2012, Rose released her first single \"Guilty Pleasure\" with Gary Go. In November 2016, Rose released and directed The Veronicas' single \"On Your Side\".[35] She is a supporter of many charities, won a charity boxing match,[36] and has travelled to Laos and Africa to volunteer each year. Issues of concern to her include animal welfare, campaigns for anti-bullying and youth mental health, where she works as an ambassador for Headspace. Known for being extensively tattooed, she showed off her tattoos in a photo spread for Maxim Australia and PETA, as part of the campaign \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\".[37][38]\nRose came out as a lesbian at the age of 12.[39] Because of her sexuality, she suffered verbal taunts and physical abuse from her schoolmates, which led to a suicide attempt.[39] She was also sexually abused as a child by a relative,[40] and has bipolar disorder and clinical depression.[39]\nWith regard to childhood gender nonconformity, Rose said she wanted to be a boy while growing up and that she was saving up money to physically transition from female to male.[41][42] She said, \"It was in my mind as something I wanted to do and then I just... didn't. I guess I grew out of it. I even used to sleep on my front because I didn't want to get boobs ever, which I think worked actually.\"[42] She stated that modelling led her to discover androgyny, and allowed her to model with different gender expressions. She recalled, \"I remember being at a yum cha restaurant with my dad and the owner coming up and saying, 'Excuse me, we're trying to work out if you're a handsome boy or a beautiful girl.' It was a compliment and I was shocked, and when I thought about it I actually wanted to be a handsome boy.\"[43]\nRose is genderfluid, saying, \"I am very gender fluid and feel more like I wake up every day sort of gender neutral.\"[44] This announcement came approximately a week after she released Break Free, in which she visually transforms from a very feminine woman to a heavily tattooed man. Rose stated, however, that she prefers to continue using feminine pronouns.[45] While if she had to choose a sex, she commented that she would choose to be male, she does not feel like she should have been born with different body parts. Seeing the desire her transgender friends had for transitioning, she asked herself if her need to transition matched theirs, and concluded that she is satisfied being gender neutral. \"I think at this stage I will stay a woman but ... who knows. I'm so comfortable right now I feel wonderful about it, but I also fluctuate a lot,\" she added.[41]\nIn 2014, Rose announced her engagement to fashion designer Phoebe Dahl; in December 2015, they ended their romantic relationship.[46][47] Rose was in a relationship with singer Jess Origliasso of The Veronicas from October 2016 to April 2018,[48] having previously dated in 2008.[49]\nRose is a vegan; she suggested that people who want to help address climate change should consider what they are eating.[50]\nIn 2019, Rose underwent emergency back surgery for a spine issue that led to two herniated discs caused by her work on a film set doing physical stunts. She said if she did not have the surgery, she was at risk of being paralyzed.[51]\nVarious media outlets have commented on public fascination with Rose's gender identity, gender expression, and physical appearance, including her tattoos and visual or behavioral similarities to Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber, and a younger Leonardo DiCaprio.[52][53][54] In 2008 and 2009, she was chosen as one of the \"25 Most Influential Gay and Lesbian Australians\" by SameSame, an Australian online gay and lesbian community.[55] The public and media attention increased following Rose's debut on Orange Is the New Black, significantly with regard to heterosexual women commenting on her physical appearance.[52][56] During 2015, she was the fifth most searched person on Google.[57] PETA named her one of three \"Sexiest Vegans\" of 2017.[58]\nEmma Teitel of Maclean's stated, \"Rose [...] resembles an androgynous Angelina Jolie; she is a rare combination of angular and soft. She is a badass with a permanently arched brow and a Justin Bieber haircut. In other words, she is the lesbian James Dean. And straight women are falling madly in love with her.\"[56] Alex Rees of Cosmopolitan said that everyone was enamored of Rose at the time of her season three appearance on Orange Is the New Black.[59]\nThe media attention resulted in a new, open discourse about sexual fluidity and whether or not sexual orientation can change, with some of the media expressing disapproval toward heterosexual women stating that they would \"go gay for Ruby Rose.\"[56][59] Teitel wrote that many on Twitter expressed skepticism that all it takes is a pretty face to change sexual orientation, and this was accompanied by the argument that saying \"you [can] 'go gay' for Ruby Rose reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice, and is homophobic.\" She felt that it was predictable and ironic that the people most eager to admonish others for expressing their attraction to Rose were a part of the LGBT community, and cited a Jezebel article which commented that homosexuality and bisexuality are not simply identities to show off liberalism, but are rather \"built into a person's biology.\" To Teitel, this response suggested that \"one must either reject the norm (heterosexuality) or embrace it full force.\" She felt the discussion was a wasted opportunity for sexual exploration, which she believes is \"a lot less daunting when labels are malleable,\" and emphasized the idea of \"letting everyone define their sexuality on their own terms.\"[56]\nRose acknowledged the public discourse concerning her physical appearance and subsequent debate on sexual fluidity, commenting that, while she thought it was brilliant and was not expecting it, some of her friends found the public affection toward her inappropriate: \"They personally are offended by it, [and are] saying like, 'You can't just choose to be gay. You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.[59]\nIn Entertainment Weekly's 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series Batwoman.[60] She stated that the opportunity to audition for Orange Is the New Black came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in Batwoman, I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman \u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"[60]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRuPaul Andre Charles (born November 17, 1960) is an American drag queen, actor, model, singer, songwriter, and television personality. Since 2009, he has produced and hosted the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race, for which he has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. RuPaul is considered to be the most commercially successful drag queen in the United States. In 2017, he was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[1] In 2019, Fortune noted RuPaul as \u201ceasily the world's most famous\u201d drag queen.[2] RuPaul was born and raised in San Diego, California and later moved to Atlanta, Georgia to study performing arts. He settled in New York City, where he became a popular fixture on the nightclub scene. RuPaul achieved international fame as a drag queen with the release of his debut single, \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\", which was included on his debut studio album Supermodel of the World (1993). In 1994, he became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics, raising money for the Mac AIDS Fund and becoming the first drag queen to land a major cosmetics campaign. That year, he received his own talk show on VH1, The RuPaul Show, which he hosted for over 100 episodes, while co-hosting the morning radio show on WKTU with Michelle Visage. He has had continued success as a recording artist, releasing 14 studio albums to date (as of 2017), including Foxy Lady (1996), Champion (2009), Glamazon (2011), Born Naked (2014), and American (2017). As an actor, RuPaul has made appearances in films including Crooklyn (1994), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995), But I'm a Cheerleader (1999), Hurricane Bianca (2016), the Comedy Central series Broad City (2017), and the Netflix original programming Girlboss (2017) and Grace and Frankie (2019). He has also published three books: Lettin' It All Hang Out (1995), Workin' It! RuPaul's Guide to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Style (2010), and GuRu (2018). Additionally, RuPaul's Drag Race has produced eleven seasons to date (as of 2019) and has inspired several spin-off series, including RuPaul's Drag U and RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. He is also featured as a host on series such as Skin Wars, Good Work, and Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul. In June 2019, his daytime talk show RuPaul premiered, which was cancelled after a three-week test run.[3] RuPaul is indifferent to gender-specific pronouns about him, writing: \"You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just as long as you call me.\"[4] RuPaul has also played male roles and makes public appearances in male and female drag.[4] RuPaul was born in San Diego, California, on November 17, 1960.[5] He was named by his mother, Ernestine \"Toni\" Charles, a Louisiana native; the Ru came from roux, which is the term for the base of gumbo and other creole stews and soups.[6] When his parents divorced in 1967, he and his three sisters lived with their mother.[7] At the age of 15, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, with his sister Renetta to study performing arts. In the ensuing years, RuPaul struggled as a musician and filmmaker during the 1980s, where he worked at Atlanta's famed Plaza Theatre. In 1982, he debuted on an Atlanta public access variety show called The American Music Show, in which he made frequent appearances over the years.[4]:59[8] He also participated in underground cinema, helping create the low-budget film Star Booty, and an album by the same name. In Atlanta, RuPaul often performed at the Celebrity Club, managed by Larry Tee, as a bar dancer or with his band, Wee Wee Pole.[9][10][11] RuPaul also performed as a backup singer to Glen Meadmore along with drag queen Vaginal Davis.[12] RuPaul's first prominent national exposure came in 1989 dancing as an extra in the video for \"Love Shack\" by The B-52's.[citation needed] In the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. Initially participating in gender bender-style performances, RuPaul performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at several New York City nightclubs, most notably the Pyramid Club. He played opposite New York City drag performer Mona Foote (Nashom Benjamin) in the one-act science-fiction parody \"My Pet Homo\" written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. He appeared for many years at the annual Wigstock drag festival and appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie. In the 1990s, RuPaul was known in the UK for his appearances on the Channel 4 series Manhattan Cable, a weekly series produced by World of Wonder and presented by American Laurie Pike about New York's wild and wacky public-access television system. In 1993, RuPaul recorded the dance/house album Supermodel of the World. It was released through the rap label Tommy Boy, spawning the dance track hit \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\". The music video was an unexpected success on MTV channels, as grunge and gangsta rap were popular at the time. The song peaked at 45 on the Billboard Hot 100. It charted on the UK Singles Chart, peaking on the top 40 at 39. The song found the most success on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where it peaked at 2. Radio airplay, heavy rotation of the music video on MTV and television appearances on popular programs like The Arsenio Hall Show popularized the song. His next two singles/videos, \"Back to My Roots\" and \"A Shade Shady (Now Prance)\", both went to the top spot on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and furthered his campy persona. Between them, \"House of Love\" was released without a video. It failed to place on any U.S. charts, despite rising to 68 on the UK Singles Chart. RuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for MAC Cosmetics. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text \"I am the MAC girl\". He also released his autobiography, Lettin' It All Hang Out. He promoted the book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on ABC's All My Children, in a storyline that put it on the set of Erica Kane's talk show \"The Cutting Edge\". The next year he landed a talk show of his own on VH1, called The RuPaul Show, interviewing celebrity guests and musical acts. Diana Ross, Nirvana, Duran Duran, Pat Benatar, Mary J. Blige, Bea Arthur, Dionne Warwick, Cyndi Lauper, Olivia Newton-John, Beenie Man, Pete Burns, Bow Wow Wow, and the Backstreet Boys were notable guests. His co-host was Michelle Visage, with whom he also co-hosted on WKTU radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests Chi Chi LaRue and Tom Chase speaking about the gay porn industry. Later in the year he released his second album, Foxy Lady, this time on the L.A.-based Rhino Records label. Despite his growing celebrity, he failed to chart on the Billboard 200. However, the first single \"Snapshot\" found success in the dance market and went to number four on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, which was his second and only other Hot 100 entry to date (1996?). The second single \"A Little Bit of Love\" only charted at 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album featured covers of a 1981 Diana Ross song \"Work That Body\", co-written by Paul Jabara and \"If You Were a Woman and I Was a Man\", originally recorded by Bonnie Tyler. Because of his strong fan base within the gay community, RuPaul has performed at gay pride events and numerous gay clubs. During this time RuPaul helped launch the return of WKTU radio in New York City and would serve as host of the morning show until 1998. In 1997, he released his third album, a Christmas album entitled Ho Ho Ho. He has had guest appearances in many films, including both Brady Bunch movies, in which he played Jan's female guidance counselor. In 1997 RuPaul teamed with Martha Wash to remake the classic disco anthem, \"It's Raining Men\". The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD RuPaul's Go Go Box Classics, which was a collection of some of his favorite dance songs by other artists; this would be his third and final release through Rhino Records and a major record label. It was during this time that he appeared in Webex TV commercials and magazine ads. In 2002 he recorded with Brigitte Nielsen, credited as Gitta, the Eurodance track \"You're No Lady\". In 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, Red Hot on his own RuCo Inc. music label. It received some dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his blog, RuPaul discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, particularly the gay press. In one incident, it was noted that Entertainment Weekly refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to \"a black person being invited to a party, but only if they'll serve.\" Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, Red Hot showed RuPaul returning to the top of the dance charts in the US with the lead off single \"Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous\" hitting number two on the dance chart. The second, \"WorkOut\", peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album \"People Are People\" a duet with Tom Trujillo peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the Top Electronic Albums chart, where it hit number nine.[14] When asked about this in an interview, RuPaul said, \"Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. 'Betrayed' alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don't feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don't know what happened. It seemed I couldn't get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals.\"[13] On June 13, 2006, RuPaul released ReWorked, his first remix album and fifth album overall. It features reworked versions of songs from his back catalog, as well as new recordings. The only single released from the album is a re-recording of \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\", reaching number 21 on the U.S. dance chart. June 20, 2007, saw the release of Starrbooty (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) in the United States. The single \"Call Me Starrbooty\" was digitally released in 2007. The album contains new tracks as well as interludes with dialogue from the movie. The film was released on DVD in October 2007. In mid-2008, RuPaul began producing RuPaul's Drag Race, a reality television game show which aired on Logo in February 2009. The premise of the program has drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as \"America's next drag superstar\". The first season's winner was BeBe Zahara Benet, and first runner-up Nina Flowers was chosen by fans as \"Miss Congeniality\" through voting via the show's official website. In publicity preparation for the new show, RuPaul made appearances as a guest on several other shows in 2008 including as a guest judge on episode 6 of season 5 of Project Runway[15] and as a guest \"chef\" on Paula's Party.[16] In March 2009, RuPaul released the album Champion. The album spawned four singles \"Cover Girl\", \"Jealous of My Boogie\", \"Devil Made Me Do It\" and \"Tranny Chaser\". The album peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums as well as 26 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Logo's second annual NewNowNext Awards in 2009 were hosted by RuPaul. There he performed \"Jealous of My Boogie (Gomi & RasJek Edit)\". In March 2010, RuPaul released his second remix album, Drag Race, the album features remixes of songs from the 2009 album Champion.[17] [18] In April 2011, coinciding with the finale of season 3 of RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul released his sixth studio album Glamazon, produced by Revolucian, who previously worked with RuPaul on his album Champion. The album charted on Billboard\u2019s Dance/Electronic Albums and the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart at 11 and 8 respectively. In July 2011, RuPaul released another remix EP entitled SuperGlam DQ, which features remixes of tracks from Glamazon, remixes of the \"Drag U Theme Song\", and a new song, \"Sexy Drag Queen\". Starting in June 2011, the second season of RuPaul's Drag U aired. In late 2011, promotions for season 4 of Drag Race began. RuPaul made appearances on The Rosie Show and The Chew, and also attended a Drag Race NY Premiere party at Patricia Field's store in New York. Season 4 of RuPaul's Drag Race premiered on Logo on January 30, 2012, with RuPaul returning as the main host and judge. After season 4 ended, TV.com declared it was the best reality TV show on television. In the fall of 2012, the spin-off RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars premiered after a large fan demand. The show featured past contestants of the previous four seasons to compete. Season 5 of RuPaul's Drag Race premiered on January 28, 2013, with a 90-minute special and RuPaul returning as the main host and judge. On April 30, 2013, RuPaul released a single \"Lick It Lollipop\" featuring Lady Bunny, who RuPaul previously collaborated with on Champion. On October 25, 2013 RuPaul reported via Twitter that the new album would be released in January 2014. In fall of 2013, RuPaul joined forces with cosmetic manufacturers Colorevolution to launch his debut make-up line featuring ultra-rich pigment cosmetics and a beauty collection. Released alongside the line was a unisex perfume entitled \"Glamazon\". Talking to World of Wonder, RuPaul said: \"Glamazon is for women and men of all ages and preferences who share one thing in common: They are not afraid to be fierce. For me, glamour should be accessible to all, and I am committed to helping the world look and smell more beautiful.\" The line was exclusively sold on the Colorevolution website in various gift sets.[19][20] RuPaul and Revolucian both confirmed through their Twitter and Instagram accounts that they had been working on an upcoming seventh studio album. Born Naked was released on February 24, 2014 to coincide with the premiere of the 6th season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Prior to the premiere, an album of RuPaul cover songs performed by the Season 6 cast was released on January 28, 2014. The covers album is titled RuPaul Presents The CoverGurlz and contains RuPaul songs from 2009\u20132013. To further promote the Drag Race season premiere, RuPaul, representing Logo TV (and parent company Viacom) was chosen to ring the NASDAQ closing bell on February 24, 2014. The week of its release, Born Naked reached number one on the iTunes dance album chart. The following week it placed at number 4 on the US Billboard dance chart and 85 on the Billboard 200 chart. In a profile by The New York Times it was revealed that RuPaul is currently working on a porcelain statuette of his likeness.[21] On April 9, 2014 RuPaul and Michelle Visage released the first episode of their podcast, RuPaul: What's the Tee? with Michelle Visage. In August, he joined the reality competition show Skin Wars acting as a judge. On March 2, 2015, RuPaul released his eighth studio album, Realness. The release coincided with the premiere of the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race. In April, he launched and began hosting a new show, Good Work, a plastic surgery-themed talk show for E!. In October he released his second Christmas album, and ninth studio album, Slay Belles. The album contains ten original Christmas-themed songs and features collaborations with Michelle Visage, Siedah Garrett, Todrick Hall and Big Freedia. The album charted at 21 on the US Billboard Dance chart.[22] In January 2016, it was announced RuPaul would present a new game show for Logo TV called Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul which premiered on April 11, 2016 after RuPaul's Drag Race.[23] In February 2016, RuPaul announced his tenth album, Butch Queen. It was released in March 2016, just prior to the premiere of the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[24] A song from the album, \"U Wear It Well\" was featured in the teaser campaigns for the season and was later officially released as the first single on iTunes in February 2016. The album charted at number 3 on the US Billboard Dance chart, marking his highest position on this chart to date (2016?).[22] \"'Be Someone\" featuring American singer Taylor Dayne was released as the album's second and final single. Additionally, Butch Queen: The Ru-Mixes was released. In July 2016, it was announced that RuPaul was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. He would go on to win the award at the September Creative Arts Emmy Awards Ceremony. 2016 also saw the release of the single \"Read U Wrote U\" that features rap parts by the RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 2 finalists Roxxxy Andrews, Katya Zamolodchikova, Alaska Thunderfuck, and Detox Icunt with production by Ellis Miah.[25] On January 27, 2017, RuPaul announced that a new album would be released the week after. The album, named Remember Me: Essential, Vol. 1 was put up for pre-order on February 2 and eventually released the next day. It is a collection of new songs and remakes of classic RuPaul hits that feature new artists.[26] Two singles have been released from the album so far: \"Rock It (To The Moon)\" which is a new song loosely based on the lyrics and the melody of \"Hey Booty\" which was released on the Starrbooty soundtrack in 2007, and an updated version of RuPaul's 1996 hit single \"Snapshot\" from the album Foxy Lady. The album failed to chart on the Dance Albums Chart but managed to debut at number four on the Billboard Dance Albums Sales Chart in the United States. It also charted at number eleven on the UK Dance Albums Chart, becoming RuPaul's highest charting album on that chart, after Realness managed to debut and peak at number 13. On March 24, 2017, RuPaul released his eleventh studio album, American.[27] Later that same day, the ninth regular season of RuPaul's Drag Race debuted on basic cable channel VH1, home of RuPaul's talk show in the 1990s. This marked a move from expanded cable channel Logo TV, which aired all previous seasons of the show. The season 9 premiere featured singer Lady Gaga as its guest judge and proved a success, with ratings of nearly 1,000,000 viewers, making it the series' most viewed episode. This figure was double LogoTV's season 8 premiere ratings from the year prior, and triple VH1's usual Friday night viewership in that programming timeslot.[28] When the ratings were released, World of Wonder Productions announced they were casting contestants for a tenth season.[29] On June 2, Essential, Vol. 2 was put up on pre-order on iTunes. It was released on June 9 and preceded by the single \"Crying on the Dance Floor\" which is a re-recording of the 2010 single \"Main Event\" from the album Champion. On June 22, 2017, it was announced that RuPaul will receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry.[30] He was awarded the honor on March 16, 2018, making him the first drag queen to be given such an award.[31] In August 2018, it was announced that RuPaul will be releasing his third Christmas album in October 2018.[32] In June 2019, a daytime talk show titled RuPaul premiered, however it was cancelled after a three-week test run, since it was not picked by any Fox TV stations.[33][3] He also appeared in Taylor Swift's \"You Need to Calm Down\" music video.[34] In January 2020, it was announced that RuPaul would host Saturday Night Live for the first time. He is scheduled to host the episode airing on February 8, 2020 with Justin Bieber as a musical guest.[35] RuPaul is considered to be the most commercially successful drag queen in the United States.[36] He has been credited with creating wider exposure for drag queens from LGBT culture in to mainstream society, thanks to his early-career chart success, and later, the successive climb in viewership of RuPaul's Drag Race.[37] His talk show The RuPaul Show was the first ever national talk show to have a drag queen as a host. Along with his partner Michelle Visage, he welcomed an array of high-profile guests such as Cher, Lil Kim, and Diana Ross over the show's 100-episode span. As well as having a variety of comedy skits, the show was noted for discussing topics such as black empowerment, female empowerment, misogyny, and liberal politics which were otherwise unheard of in 1990s television at the time.[38] In 1999, RuPaul was awarded the Vito Russo Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for work in promoting equality in the LGBT community. RuPaul has also been noted as having a large part in RuPaul's Drag Race's continuous television success. By pioneering queer representation on television, many believe RuPaul to have essentially revolutionised the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community on screen.[39] He first won an Emmy for his work on the show in 2016, and one year later the show garnered eight nominations, including Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first time in its 11-season run, and a second consecutive win for RuPaul in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program.[40] In 2017, he was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[1] In 2019 Fortune noted RuPaul as \u201ceasily the world's most famous\u201d drag queen.[2] RuPaul has a complex relationship with the transgender community, in part due to differing philosophies: through drag he seeks to mock gender and identity stereotypes, while in his view the trans community takes identity seriously.[41] RuPaul's Drag Race has featured a number of contestants who are trans women, some of whom made their identity public while competing on the show, including Sonique, Carmen Carrera, Jiggly Caliente, Monica Beverly Hillz, Kenya Michaels and Gia Gunn.[42][43] In 2017 Peppermint became the first contestant to compete throughout her season as an openly transgender woman.[44] Other non-conforming gender identities expressed by former contestants include nonbinary (Jinkx Monsoon, Adore Delano,[45] Aja and Valentina), gender fluid (Courtney Act) and genderqueer (Violet Chachki and Sasha Velour).[46][47] In 2014 trans activists and former contestants Carmen Carrera and Monica Beverly Hillz criticized the show's use of words such as tranny and shemale, including the main challenge announcement phrase up to season 6, \"You've got she-mail\", which they described as transphobic.[48][49] That year's season also included a \"Female or She-male\" segment which required contestants to guess whether various photographs featured cisgender \"biological women\" or \"psychological women\" (drag queens), causing further criticism.[50] RuPaul and the producers issued a statement promising \"to help spread love, acceptance and understanding\" and Logo TV removed the \"You've got she-mail\" phrase from subsequent broadcasts.[51] RuPaul criticized those attempting to police his language in bad faith and noted that tranny referred to transvestites and drag queens, not just trans women.[52][53] In 2018 RuPaul gave an interview to The Guardian in which he stated that a post-transition trans woman would \"probably not\" be accepted onto the show, noting that at the time of competition Peppermint had not yet had breast implants.[54] After facing criticism on social media and from former contestants for his remarks,[55] RuPaul compared trans drag queens who had transitioned to athletes who had taken performance-enhancing drugs.[56] He subsequently expressed regret for the hurt caused by his remarks, and that the only screening criteria for contestants were \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\".[57] RuPaul is gay. He has been with his Australian partner, Georges LeBar, since 1994, when they met at the Limelight nightclub in New York City. They married in January 2017.[58] LeBar is a painter[59] and runs a 50-acre (200,000\u00a0m2) ranch in Wyoming.[60] RuPaul publicly endorsed the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.[61] He expressed dismay at Clinton's defeat by Republican Party nominee Donald Trump, stating that \"The America that we have all fought so hard for, the narrative of love and peace and liberty and equality, it feels like it is dead.\"[62] He has described doing drag as a \"very, very political\" act because it \"challenges the status quo\" by rejecting fixed identities: \"drag says 'I'm a shapeshifter, I do whatever the hell I want at any given time'.\"[63] RuPaul has said he has been sober from mind-altering substances for more than two decades, having started smoking marijuana at age 10 or 11.[64][65][66] The podcast RuPaul: What's The Tee? With Michelle Visage debuted on April 6, 2014. Ru-Paul co-hosts with longtime friend and fellow RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage. The weekly show features their thoughts on topics including behind-the-scenes of RuPaul's Drag Race, life advice, beauty tips, and conversations with featured guests from the entertainment world.[67][68] In 2018, RuPaul was one of the actors who voiced the audiobook A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo.[69] Launched through production company World of Wonder, RuPaul's DragCon LA, is an annual drag-themed convention held in Los Angeles starting in 2015, followed by RuPaul's DragCon NYC as of 2017 in New York City, which allows members of the public to meet with RuPaul, former RuPaul's Drag Race contestants and other drag queens.[70] The conventions feature performances, meet-and-greet booths, merchandise sales and panel discussions.[71]",

Since 2009, he has produced and hosted the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race, for which he has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. RuPaul is considered to be the most commercially successful drag queen in the United States. In 2017, he was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[1] In 2019, Fortune noted RuPaul as \u201ceasily the world's most famous\u201d drag queen.[2]\nRuPaul was born and raised in San Diego, California and later moved to Atlanta, Georgia to study performing arts. He settled in New York City, where he became a popular fixture on the nightclub scene. RuPaul achieved international fame as a drag queen with the release of his debut single, \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\", which was included on his debut studio album Supermodel of the World (1993). In 1994, he became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics, raising money for the Mac AIDS Fund and becoming the first drag queen to land a major cosmetics campaign. That year, he received his own talk show on VH1, The RuPaul Show, which he hosted for over 100 episodes, while co-hosting the morning radio show on WKTU with Michelle Visage. He has had continued success as a recording artist, releasing 14 studio albums to date (as of 2017), including Foxy Lady (1996), Champion (2009), Glamazon (2011), Born Naked (2014), and American (2017).\nAs an actor, RuPaul has made appearances in films including Crooklyn (1994), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995), But I'm a Cheerleader (1999), Hurricane Bianca (2016), the Comedy Central series Broad City (2017), and the Netflix original programming Girlboss (2017) and Grace and Frankie (2019). He has also published three books: Lettin' It All Hang Out (1995), Workin' It! RuPaul's Guide to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Style (2010), and GuRu (2018). Additionally, RuPaul's Drag Race has produced eleven seasons to date (as of 2019) and has inspired several spin-off series, including RuPaul's Drag U and RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. He is also featured as a host on series such as Skin Wars, Good Work, and Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul. In June 2019, his daytime talk show RuPaul premiered, which was cancelled after a three-week test run.[3]\nRuPaul is indifferent to gender-specific pronouns about him, writing: \"You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just as long as you call me.\"[4] RuPaul has also played male roles and makes public appearances in male and female drag.[4]\nRuPaul was born in San Diego, California, on November 17, 1960.[5] He was named by his mother, Ernestine \"Toni\" Charles, a Louisiana native; the Ru came from roux, which is the term for the base of gumbo and other creole stews and soups.[6] When his parents divorced in 1967, he and his three sisters lived with their mother.[7]\nAt the age of 15, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, with his sister Renetta to study performing arts. In the ensuing years, RuPaul struggled as a musician and filmmaker during the 1980s, where he worked at Atlanta's famed Plaza Theatre. In 1982, he debuted on an Atlanta public access variety show called The American Music Show, in which he made frequent appearances over the years.[4]:59[8] He also participated in underground cinema, helping create the low-budget film Star Booty, and an album by the same name. In Atlanta, RuPaul often performed at the Celebrity Club, managed by Larry Tee, as a bar dancer or with his band, Wee Wee Pole.[9][10][11] RuPaul also performed as a backup singer to Glen Meadmore along with drag queen Vaginal Davis.[12] RuPaul's first prominent national exposure came in 1989 dancing as an extra in the video for \"Love Shack\" by The B-52's.[citation needed]\nIn the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. Initially participating in gender bender-style performances, RuPaul performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at several New York City nightclubs, most notably the Pyramid Club. He played opposite New York City drag performer Mona Foote (Nashom Benjamin) in the one-act science-fiction parody \"My Pet Homo\" written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. He appeared for many years at the annual Wigstock drag festival and appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie. In the 1990s, RuPaul was known in the UK for his appearances on the Channel 4 series Manhattan Cable, a weekly series produced by World of Wonder and presented by American Laurie Pike about New York's wild and wacky public-access television system.\nIn 1993, RuPaul recorded the dance/house album Supermodel of the World. It was released through the rap label Tommy Boy, spawning the dance track hit \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\". The music video was an unexpected success on MTV channels, as grunge and gangsta rap were popular at the time. The song peaked at 45 on the Billboard Hot 100. It charted on the UK Singles Chart, peaking on the top 40 at 39. The song found the most success on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where it peaked at 2. Radio airplay, heavy rotation of the music video on MTV and television appearances on popular programs like The Arsenio Hall Show popularized the song.\nHis next two singles/videos, \"Back to My Roots\" and \"A Shade Shady (Now Prance)\", both went to the top spot on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and furthered his campy persona. Between them, \"House of Love\" was released without a video. It failed to place on any U.S. charts, despite rising to 68 on the UK Singles Chart.\nRuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for MAC Cosmetics. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text \"I am the MAC girl\". He also released his autobiography, Lettin' It All Hang Out. He promoted the book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on ABC's All My Children, in a storyline that put it on the set of Erica Kane's talk show \"The Cutting Edge\".\nThe next year he landed a talk show of his own on VH1, called The RuPaul Show, interviewing celebrity guests and musical acts. Diana Ross, Nirvana, Duran Duran, Pat Benatar, Mary J. Blige, Bea Arthur, Dionne Warwick, Cyndi Lauper, Olivia Newton-John, Beenie Man, Pete Burns, Bow Wow Wow, and the Backstreet Boys were notable guests. His co-host was Michelle Visage, with whom he also co-hosted on WKTU radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests Chi Chi LaRue and Tom Chase speaking about the gay porn industry.\nLater in the year he released his second album, Foxy Lady, this time on the L.A.-based Rhino Records label. Despite his growing celebrity, he failed to chart on the Billboard 200. However, the first single \"Snapshot\" found success in the dance market and went to number four on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, which was his second and only other Hot 100 entry to date (1996?). The second single \"A Little Bit of Love\" only charted at 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album featured covers of a 1981 Diana Ross song \"Work That Body\", co-written by Paul Jabara and \"If You Were a Woman and I Was a Man\", originally recorded by Bonnie Tyler. Because of his strong fan base within the gay community, RuPaul has performed at gay pride events and numerous gay clubs. During this time RuPaul helped launch the return of WKTU radio in New York City and would serve as host of the morning show until 1998.\nIn 1997, he released his third album, a Christmas album entitled Ho Ho Ho. He has had guest appearances in many films, including both Brady Bunch movies, in which he played Jan's female guidance counselor. In 1997 RuPaul teamed with Martha Wash to remake the classic disco anthem, \"It's Raining Men\". The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD RuPaul's Go Go Box Classics, which was a collection of some of his favorite dance songs by other artists; this would be his third and final release through Rhino Records and a major record label. It was during this time that he appeared in Webex TV commercials and magazine ads. In 2002 he recorded with Brigitte Nielsen, credited as Gitta, the Eurodance track \"You're No Lady\".\nIn 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, Red Hot on his own RuCo Inc. music label. It received some dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his blog, RuPaul discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, particularly the gay press. In one incident, it was noted that Entertainment Weekly refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to \"a black person being invited to a party, but only if they'll serve.\" Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, Red Hot showed RuPaul returning to the top of the dance charts in the US with the lead off single \"Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous\" hitting number two on the dance chart. The second, \"WorkOut\", peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album \"People Are People\" a duet with Tom Trujillo peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the Top Electronic Albums chart, where it hit number nine.[14] When asked about this in an interview, RuPaul said, \"Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. 'Betrayed' alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don't feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don't know what happened. It seemed I couldn't get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals.\"[13]\nOn June 13, 2006, RuPaul released ReWorked, his first remix album and fifth album overall. It features reworked versions of songs from his back catalog, as well as new recordings. The only single released from the album is a re-recording of \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\", reaching number 21 on the U.S. dance chart. June 20, 2007, saw the release of Starrbooty (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) in the United States. The single \"Call Me Starrbooty\" was digitally released in 2007. The album contains new tracks as well as interludes with dialogue from the movie. The film was released on DVD in October 2007.\nIn mid-2008, RuPaul began producing RuPaul's Drag Race, a reality television game show which aired on Logo in February 2009. The premise of the program has drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as \"America's next drag superstar\". The first season's winner was BeBe Zahara Benet, and first runner-up Nina Flowers was chosen by fans as \"Miss Congeniality\" through voting via the show's official website. In publicity preparation for the new show, RuPaul made appearances as a guest on several other shows in 2008 including as a guest judge on episode 6 of season 5 of Project Runway[15] and as a guest \"chef\" on Paula's Party.[16]\nIn March 2009, RuPaul released the album Champion. The album spawned four singles \"Cover Girl\", \"Jealous of My Boogie\", \"Devil Made Me Do It\" and \"Tranny Chaser\". The album peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums as well as 26 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Logo's second annual NewNowNext Awards in 2009 were hosted by RuPaul. There he performed \"Jealous of My Boogie (Gomi &amp; RasJek Edit)\". In March 2010, RuPaul released his second remix album, Drag Race, the album features remixes of songs from the 2009 album Champion.[17]\n[18]\nIn April 2011, coinciding with the finale of season 3 of RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul released his sixth studio album Glamazon, produced by Revolucian, who previously worked with RuPaul on his album Champion. The album charted on Billboard\u2019s Dance/Electronic Albums and the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart at 11 and 8 respectively. In July 2011, RuPaul released another remix EP entitled SuperGlam DQ, which features remixes of tracks from Glamazon, remixes of the \"Drag U Theme Song\", and a new song, \"Sexy Drag Queen\". Starting in June 2011, the second season of RuPaul's Drag U aired. In late 2011, promotions for season 4 of Drag Race began. RuPaul made appearances on The Rosie Show and The Chew, and also attended a Drag Race NY Premiere party at Patricia Field's store in New York. Season 4 of RuPaul's Drag Race premiered on Logo on January 30, 2012, with RuPaul returning as the main host and judge. After season 4 ended, TV.com declared it was the best reality TV show on television.\nIn the fall of 2012, the spin-off RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars premiered after a large fan demand. The show featured past contestants of the previous four seasons to compete. Season 5 of RuPaul's Drag Race premiered on January 28, 2013, with a 90-minute special and RuPaul returning as the main host and judge. On April 30, 2013, RuPaul released a single \"Lick It Lollipop\" featuring Lady Bunny, who RuPaul previously collaborated with on Champion. On October 25, 2013 RuPaul reported via Twitter that the new album would be released in January 2014.\nIn fall of 2013, RuPaul joined forces with cosmetic manufacturers Colorevolution to launch his debut make-up line featuring ultra-rich pigment cosmetics and a beauty collection. Released alongside the line was a unisex perfume entitled \"Glamazon\". Talking to World of Wonder, RuPaul said: \"Glamazon is for women and men of all ages and preferences who share one thing in common: They are not afraid to be fierce. For me, glamour should be accessible to all, and I am committed to helping the world look and smell more beautiful.\" The line was exclusively sold on the Colorevolution website in various gift sets.[19][20]\nRuPaul and Revolucian both confirmed through their Twitter and Instagram accounts that they had been working on an upcoming seventh studio album. Born Naked was released on February 24, 2014 to coincide with the premiere of the 6th season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Prior to the premiere, an album of RuPaul cover songs performed by the Season 6 cast was released on January 28, 2014. The covers album is titled RuPaul Presents The CoverGurlz and contains RuPaul songs from 2009\u20132013. To further promote the Drag Race season premiere, RuPaul, representing Logo TV (and parent company Viacom) was chosen to ring the NASDAQ closing bell on February 24, 2014. The week of its release, Born Naked reached number one on the iTunes dance album chart. The following week it placed at number 4 on the US Billboard dance chart and 85 on the Billboard 200 chart. In a profile by The New York Times it was revealed that RuPaul is currently working on a porcelain statuette of his likeness.[21] On April 9, 2014 RuPaul and Michelle Visage released the first episode of their podcast, RuPaul: What's the Tee? with Michelle Visage. In August, he joined the reality competition show Skin Wars acting as a judge.\nOn March 2, 2015, RuPaul released his eighth studio album, Realness. The release coincided with the premiere of the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race. In April, he launched and began hosting a new show, Good Work, a plastic surgery-themed talk show for E!. In October he released his second Christmas album, and ninth studio album, Slay Belles. The album contains ten original Christmas-themed songs and features collaborations with Michelle Visage, Siedah Garrett, Todrick Hall and Big Freedia. The album charted at 21 on the US Billboard Dance chart.[22]\nIn January 2016, it was announced RuPaul would present a new game show for Logo TV called Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul which premiered on April 11, 2016 after RuPaul's Drag Race.[23] In February 2016, RuPaul announced his tenth album, Butch Queen. It was released in March 2016, just prior to the premiere of the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[24] A song from the album, \"U Wear It Well\" was featured in the teaser campaigns for the season and was later officially released as the first single on iTunes in February 2016. The album charted at number 3 on the US Billboard Dance chart, marking his highest position on this chart to date (2016?).[22] \"'Be Someone\" featuring American singer Taylor Dayne was released as the album's second and final single. Additionally, Butch Queen: The Ru-Mixes was released.\nIn July 2016, it was announced that RuPaul was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. He would go on to win the award at the September Creative Arts Emmy Awards Ceremony. 2016 also saw the release of the single \"Read U Wrote U\" that features rap parts by the RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 2 finalists Roxxxy Andrews, Katya Zamolodchikova, Alaska Thunderfuck, and Detox Icunt with production by Ellis Miah.[25]\nOn January 27, 2017, RuPaul announced that a new album would be released the week after. The album, named Remember Me: Essential, Vol. 1 was put up for pre-order on February 2 and eventually released the next day. It is a collection of new songs and remakes of classic RuPaul hits that feature new artists.[26] Two singles have been released from the album so far: \"Rock It (To The Moon)\" which is a new song loosely based on the lyrics and the melody of \"Hey Booty\" which was released on the Starrbooty soundtrack in 2007, and an updated version of RuPaul's 1996 hit single \"Snapshot\" from the album Foxy Lady. The album failed to chart on the Dance Albums Chart but managed to debut at number four on the Billboard Dance Albums Sales Chart in the United States. It also charted at number eleven on the UK Dance Albums Chart, becoming RuPaul's highest charting album on that chart, after Realness managed to debut and peak at number 13.\nOn March 24, 2017, RuPaul released his eleventh studio album, American.[27] Later that same day, the ninth regular season of RuPaul's Drag Race debuted on basic cable channel VH1, home of RuPaul's talk show in the 1990s. This marked a move from expanded cable channel Logo TV, which aired all previous seasons of the show. The season 9 premiere featured singer Lady Gaga as its guest judge and proved a success, with ratings of nearly 1,000,000 viewers, making it the series' most viewed episode. This figure was double LogoTV's season 8 premiere ratings from the year prior, and triple VH1's usual Friday night viewership in that programming timeslot.[28] When the ratings were released, World of Wonder Productions announced they were casting contestants for a tenth season.[29]\nOn June 2, Essential, Vol. 2 was put up on pre-order on iTunes. It was released on June 9 and preceded by the single \"Crying on the Dance Floor\" which is a re-recording of the 2010 single \"Main Event\" from the album Champion. On June 22, 2017, it was announced that RuPaul will receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry.[30] He was awarded the honor on March 16, 2018, making him the first drag queen to be given such an award.[31]\nIn August 2018, it was announced that RuPaul will be releasing his third Christmas album in October 2018.[32]\nIn June 2019, a daytime talk show titled RuPaul premiered, however it was cancelled after a three-week test run, since it was not picked by any Fox TV stations.[33][3] He also appeared in Taylor Swift's \"You Need to Calm Down\" music video.[34]\nIn January 2020, it was announced that RuPaul would host Saturday Night Live for the first time. He is scheduled to host the episode airing on February 8, 2020 with Justin Bieber as a musical guest.[35]\nRuPaul is considered to be the most commercially successful drag queen in the United States.[36] He has been credited with creating wider exposure for drag queens from LGBT culture in to mainstream society, thanks to his early-career chart success, and later, the successive climb in viewership of RuPaul's Drag Race.[37] His talk show The RuPaul Show was the first ever national talk show to have a drag queen as a host. Along with his partner Michelle Visage, he welcomed an array of high-profile guests such as Cher, Lil Kim, and Diana Ross over the show's 100-episode span. As well as having a variety of comedy skits, the show was noted for discussing topics such as black empowerment, female empowerment, misogyny, and liberal politics which were otherwise unheard of in 1990s television at the time.[38] In 1999, RuPaul was awarded the Vito Russo Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for work in promoting equality in the LGBT community.\nRuPaul has also been noted as having a large part in RuPaul's Drag Race's continuous television success. By pioneering queer representation on television, many believe RuPaul to have essentially revolutionised the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community on screen.[39] He first won an Emmy for his work on the show in 2016, and one year later the show garnered eight nominations, including Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first time in its 11-season run, and a second consecutive win for RuPaul in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program.[40] In 2017, he was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[1] In 2019 Fortune noted RuPaul as \u201ceasily the world's most famous\u201d drag queen.[2]\nRuPaul has a complex relationship with the transgender community, in part due to differing philosophies: through drag he seeks to mock gender and identity stereotypes, while in his view the trans community takes identity seriously.[41] RuPaul's Drag Race has featured a number of contestants who are trans women, some of whom made their identity public while competing on the show, including Sonique, Carmen Carrera, Jiggly Caliente, Monica Beverly Hillz, Kenya Michaels and Gia Gunn.[42][43] In 2017 Peppermint became the first contestant to compete throughout her season as an openly transgender woman.[44] Other non-conforming gender identities expressed by former contestants include nonbinary (Jinkx Monsoon, Adore Delano,[45] Aja and Valentina), gender fluid (Courtney Act) and genderqueer (Violet Chachki and Sasha Velour).[46][47]\nIn 2014 trans activists and former contestants Carmen Carrera and Monica Beverly Hillz criticized the show's use of words such as tranny and shemale, including the main challenge announcement phrase up to season 6, \"You've got she-mail\", which they described as transphobic.[48][49] That year's season also included a \"Female or She-male\" segment which required contestants to guess whether various photographs featured cisgender \"biological women\" or \"psychological women\" (drag queens), causing further criticism.[50] RuPaul and the producers issued a statement promising \"to help spread love, acceptance and understanding\" and Logo TV removed the \"You've got she-mail\" phrase from subsequent broadcasts.[51] RuPaul criticized those attempting to police his language in bad faith and noted that tranny referred to transvestites and drag queens, not just trans women.[52][53]\nIn 2018 RuPaul gave an interview to The Guardian in which he stated that a post-transition trans woman would \"probably not\" be accepted onto the show, noting that at the time of competition Peppermint had not yet had breast implants.[54] After facing criticism on social media and from former contestants for his remarks,[55] RuPaul compared trans drag queens who had transitioned to athletes who had taken performance-enhancing drugs.[56] He subsequently expressed regret for the hurt caused by his remarks, and that the only screening criteria for contestants were \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\".[57]\nRuPaul is gay. He has been with his Australian partner, Georges LeBar, since 1994, when they met at the Limelight nightclub in New York City.\nThey married in January 2017.[58] LeBar is a painter[59] and runs a 50-acre (200,000\u00a0m2) ranch in Wyoming.[60]\nRuPaul publicly endorsed the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.[61] He expressed dismay at Clinton's defeat by Republican Party nominee Donald Trump, stating that \"The America that we have all fought so hard for, the narrative of love and peace and liberty and equality, it feels like it is dead.\"[62]\nHe has described doing drag as a \"very, very political\" act because it \"challenges the status quo\" by rejecting fixed identities: \"drag says 'I'm a shapeshifter, I do whatever the hell I want at any given time'.\"[63]\nRuPaul has said he has been sober from mind-altering substances for more than two decades, having started smoking marijuana at age 10 or 11.[64][65][66]\nThe podcast RuPaul: What's The Tee? With Michelle Visage debuted on April 6, 2014. Ru-Paul co-hosts with longtime friend and fellow RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage. The weekly show features their thoughts on topics including behind-the-scenes of RuPaul's Drag Race, life advice, beauty tips, and conversations with featured guests from the entertainment world.[67][68]\nIn 2018, RuPaul was one of the actors who voiced the audiobook A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo.[69]\nLaunched through production company World of Wonder, RuPaul's DragCon LA, is an annual drag-themed convention held in Los Angeles starting in 2015, followed by RuPaul's DragCon NYC as of 2017 in New York City, which allows members of the public to meet with RuPaul, former RuPaul's Drag Race contestants and other drag queens.[70] The conventions feature performances, meet-and-greet booths, merchandise sales and panel discussions.[71]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nUsain St Leo Bolt, OJ, CD (/\u02c8ju\u02d0se\u026an/;[12] born 21 August 1986) is a Jamaican former sprinter. He is a world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay. Owing to his achievements and dominance in sprint competition, he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time.[13][14][15][16] An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200\u00a0m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016). In addition he won two 4 \u00d7 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic time became mandatory. An eleven-time World Champion, he won consecutive World Championship 100\u00a0m, 200\u00a0m and 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100\u00a0m false start in 2011. He is the most successful athlete of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200\u00a0m and is the joint-most successful in the 100\u00a0m with three titles. Bolt improved upon his second 100\u00a0m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 \u2013 the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the 200 metres world record, setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay world records, with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100\u00a0m; he had earlier won numerous 200\u00a0m medals (including 2007 World Championship silver) and holds the world under-20 and world under-18 records for the event. His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname \"Lightning Bolt\", and his awards include the IAAF World Athlete of the Year, Track & Field Athlete of the Year, BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year (three times) and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year (four times). Bolt retired after the 2017 World Championships, when he finished third in his last solo 100\u00a0m race, opted out of the 200\u00a0m, and pulled up in the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m relay final. Stating that it was his \"dream\" to play professional association football, in August 2018 Bolt began training with Australian A-League club the Central Coast Mariners as a left-winger. On 12 October 2018, Bolt scored twice for the team in a friendly match. He left the club the following month, and in January 2019 chose not to pursue a career in football.[17] Bolt was born on 21 August 1986 to parents Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt[10] in Sherwood Content,[18] a small town in Jamaica. He has a brother, Sadiki,[19] and a sister, Sherine.[20][21] His parents ran the local grocery store in the rural area, and Bolt spent his time playing cricket and football in the street with his brother,[22] later saying, \"When I was young, I didn't really think about anything other than sports.\"[23] As a child, Bolt attended Waldensia Primary, where he began showing his sprint potential when he ran in his parish's annual national primary school meet.[1] By the age of twelve, Bolt had become the school's fastest runner over the 100 metres distance.[24] Upon his entry to William Knibb Memorial High School, Bolt continued to focus on other sports, but his cricket coach noticed Bolt's speed on the pitch and urged him to try track and field events.[25] Pablo McNeil, a former Olympic sprint athlete,[26] and Dwayne Jarrett coached Bolt,[27] encouraging him to focus his energy on improving his athletic abilities. The school had a history of success in athletics with past students, including sprinter Michael Green.[1] Bolt won his first annual high school championships medal in 2001; he took the silver medal in the 200 metres with a time of 22.04 seconds.[1] McNeil soon became his primary coach, and the two enjoyed a positive partnership, although McNeil was occasionally frustrated by Bolt's lack of dedication to his training and his penchant for practical jokes.[26] When Bolt was a boy, he attended Sherwood Content Seventh-day Adventist Church in Trelawny, Jamaica, with his mother. His mother didn't serve pork to him in accordance with Adventist beliefs.[28] Performing for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the 400 metres in the 2001 CARIFTA Games, winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.[29] He made his first appearance on the world stage at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s.[30] Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident.[26] However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively.[29] He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.[31] Bolt is one of only nine athletes (along with Valerie Adams, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels, David Storl, and Kirani James) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. Former Prime Minister P. J. Patterson recognised Bolt's talent and arranged for him to move to Kingston, along with Jermaine Gonzales, so he could train with the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) at the University of Technology, Jamaica.[26] The 2002 World Junior Championships were held in front of a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and Bolt was given a chance to prove his credentials on a world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to 1.96 metres (6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) tall, and he physically stood out among his peers.[1] He won the 200 m in a time of 20.61 s,[32] which was 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, which he set in the 1st round.[33] Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever.[34] The expectation from the home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet, although he realized the mistake before the race began[35]. However, it turned out to be a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves.[36] As a member of the Jamaican sprint relay team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the 4\u00d7100 metres and 4\u00d7400 metres relay, running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively.[37][38] The rush of medals continued as he won four golds at the 2003 CARIFTA Games and was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the most outstanding athlete of the games.[39][40][41] He won another gold at the 2003 World Youth Championships. He set a new championship record in the 200 m with a time of 20.40 s, despite a 1.1 m/s head wind.[42] Michael Johnson, the 200 m world-record holder, took note of Bolt's potential but worried that the young sprinter might be over-pressured, stating, \"It's all about what he does three, four, five years down the line\".[43] Bolt had also impressed the athletics hierarchy, and he received the IAAF Rising Star Award for 2002.[44] Bolt competed in his final Jamaican High School Championships in 2003. He broke the 200 m and 400 m records with times of 20.25 s and 45.35 s, respectively. Bolt's runs were a significant improvement upon the previous records, beating the 200 m best by more than half a second and the 400 m record by almost a second.[1] While Bolt improved upon the 200 m time three months later, setting the still-standing World youth best at the 2003 Pan American Junior Championships.[45] The 400 m time remains No. 6 on the all-time youth list, surpassed only once since, by future Olympic champion Kirani James.[46] Bolt turned his main focus to the 200 m and equalled Roy Martin's world junior record of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships.[1][47] This performance attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time was superior to Maurice Greene's season's best that year.[43] Bolt was growing more popular in his homeland. Howard Hamilton, who was given the task of Public Defender by the government, urged the JAAA to nurture him and prevent burnout, calling Bolt \"the most phenomenal sprinter ever produced by this island\".[43] His popularity and the attractions of the capital city were beginning to be a burden to the young sprinter. Bolt was increasingly unfocused on his athletic career and preferred to eat fast food, play basketball, and party in Kingston's club scene. In the absence of a disciplined lifestyle, he became ever-more reliant on his natural ability to beat his competitors on the track.[48] As the reigning 200 m champion at both the World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the Senior World Championships in Paris.[1] He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that, even if he did not make the final, he would consider setting a personal best a success.[43][49] However, he suffered a bout of conjunctivitis before the event, and it ruined his training schedule.[1] Realising that he would not be in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead.[49] Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run.[44][50] Under the guidance of new coach Fitz Coleman, Bolt turned professional in 2004, beginning with the CARIFTA Games in Bermuda.[1] He became the first junior sprinter to run the 200 m in under twenty seconds, taking the world junior record outright with a time of 19.93 s.[1][34] For the second time in the role, he was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the most outstanding athlete of the 2004 CARIFTA Games.[39][40][51] A hamstring injury in May ruined Bolt's chances of competing in the 2004 World Junior Championships, but he was still chosen for the Jamaican Olympic squad.[52] Bolt headed to the 2004 Athens Olympics with confidence and a new record on his side. However, he was hampered by a leg injury and was eliminated in the first round of the 200 metres with a disappointing time of 21.05 s.[10][53] American colleges offered Bolt track scholarships to train in the United States while continuing to represent Jamaica on the international stage, but the teenager from Trelawny refused them all, stating that he was content to stay in his homeland of Jamaica.[21] Bolt instead chose the surroundings of the University of Technology, Jamaica, as his professional training ground, staying with the university's track and weight room that had served him well in his amateur years.[54] The year 2005 signalled a fresh start for Bolt in the form of a new coach, Glen Mills, and a new attitude toward athletics. Mills recognised Bolt's potential and aimed to cease what he considered an unprofessional approach to the sport.[53] Bolt began training with Mills in preparation for the upcoming athletics season, partnering with more seasoned sprinters such as Kim Collins and Dwain Chambers.[55] The year began well, and in July, he knocked more than a third of a second off the 200 m CAC Championship record with a run of 20.03 s,[56] then registered his 200 m season's best at London's Crystal Palace, running in 19.99 s.[10] Misfortune awaited Bolt at the next major event, the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much improved since the 2004 Olympics, and he saw the World Championships as a way to live up to expectations, stating, \"I really want to make up for what happened in Athens. Hopefully, everything will fall into place\".[57] Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s, but he suffered an injury in the final, finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s.[53][58] Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season, and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions.[59] However, his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final.[60] Bolt was involved in a car accident in November, and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations, his training schedule was further upset.[61][62] His manager, Norman Peart, made Bolt's training less intensive, and he had fully recuperated the following week.[61] Bolt had continued to improve his performances, and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006.[1] Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his primary event by 2007 or 2008. Bolt was less enthusiastic, and demanded that he feel comfortable in his sprinting.[61][63] He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006, forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and he did not return to track events until May.[64] After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold.[59] The 200 m remained Bolt's primary event when he returned to competition; he bested Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, despite the fact that bad weather had impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory.[65] However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal.[66] Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was more keen on competing over longer distances, setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.[65] Bolt claimed his first major world medal two months later at the IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart, Germany. He passed the finishing post with a time of 20.10 s, gaining a bronze medal in the process.[10] The IAAF World Cup in Athens, Greece, yielded Bolt's first senior international silver medal.[10] Wallace Spearmon from the United States won gold with a championship record time of 19.87 s, beating Bolt's respectable time of 19.96 s.[67] Further 200 m honours on both the regional and international stages awaited Bolt in 2007. He yearned to run in the 100 metres but Mills was skeptical, believing that Bolt was better suited for middle distances. The coach cited the runner's difficulty in smoothly starting out of the blocks and poor habits such as looking back at opponents in sprints. Mills told Bolt that he could run the shorter distance if he broke the 200 m national record.[53] In the Jamaican Championships, he ran 19.75 s in the 200 m, breaking the 36-year-old Jamaican record held by Don Quarrie by 0.11 s.[1][21] Mills complied with Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m, and he was entered to run the event at the 23rd Vardinoyiannia meeting in Rethymno, Crete. In his debut tournament, he won the gold medal in a time of 10.03 s, feeding his enthusiasm for the event.[21][68] He built on this achievement at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, winning a silver medal.[10] Bolt recorded 19.91 s with a headwind of 0.8 m/s. The race was won by Tyson Gay in 19.76 s, a new championship record.[69] Bolt was a member of the silver medal relay team with Asafa Powell, Marvin Anderson, and Nesta Carter in the 4\u00d7100 metres relay. Jamaica set a national record of 37.89 s.[70] Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's technique was much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in his stride frequency, giving him more driving power on the track.[53] The silver medals from the 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to sprint, and he took a more serious, more mature stance towards his career.[25] Bolt continued to develop in the 100 m, and he decided to compete in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s tail wind, improving his personal best from 10.03 s.[71] This was the second-fastest legal performance in the history of the event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy.[72] Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, especially praising Bolt's form and technique.[73] Michael Johnson observed the race and said that he was shocked at how quickly Bolt had improved over the 100 m distance.[74] The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident that there was more to come.[73] On 31 May 2008, Bolt set a new 100\u00a0m world record at the Reebok Grand Prix in the Icahn Stadium in New York City. He ran 9.72s with a tail wind of 1.7\u00a0m/s.[75] This race was Bolt's fifth senior 100 m.[76] Gay again finished second and said of Bolt: \"It looked like his knees were going past my face.\"[21] Commentators noted that Bolt appeared to have gained a psychological advantage over fellow Olympic contender Gay.[53] In June 2008, Bolt responded to claims that he was a lazy athlete, saying that the comments were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event; he chose not to make an effort to train for that particular distance.[77] Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in two events\u2014first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece.[78][79] Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.[21][80][81] Bolt doubled-up with the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the Beijing Summer Olympics. As the new 100 m world-record holder, he was the favourite to win both races.[82][83] Michael Johnson, the 200 m and 400 m record holder, personally backed the sprinter, saying that he did not believe that a lack of experience would work against him.[84] Bolt qualified for the 100 m final with times of 9.92 s and 9.85 s in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.[85][86][87] \u2014Tom Hammond, NBC Sports, with the call for the men's 100 metres final at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the Olympic 100 m final, Bolt broke new ground, winning in 9.69 s (unofficially 9.683 s) with a reaction time of 0.165 s.[88] This was an improvement upon his own world record, and he was well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson, who finished in 9.89 s.[89] Not only was the record set without a favourable wind (+0.0\u00a0m/s), but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his shoelace was untied.[90][91][92] Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished with a time of 9.52 s.[93] After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time. Considering factors such as Bolt's position, acceleration and velocity in comparison with second-place-finisher Thompson, the team estimated that Bolt could have finished in 9.55\u00b10.04 s had he not slowed to celebrate before the finishing line.[94][95] Bolt stated that setting a world record was not a priority for him, and that his goal was just to win the gold medal, Jamaica's first of the 2008 Games.[96] Olympic medallist Kriss Akabusi construed Bolt's chest slapping before the finish line as showboating, noting that the actions cost Bolt an even faster record time.[97] IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful.[98][99] Bolt denied that this was the purpose of his celebration by saying, \"I wasn't bragging. When I saw I wasn't covered, I was just happy\".[100] Lamine Diack, president of the IAAF, supported Bolt and said that his celebration was appropriate given the circumstances of his victory. Jamaican government minister Edmund Bartlett also defended Bolt's actions, stating, \"We have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them. We have to allow the personality of youth to express itself\".[101] Bolt then focused on attaining a gold medal in the 200 m event, aiming to emulate Carl Lewis' double win in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.[102] Michael Johnson felt that Bolt would easily win gold but believed that his own world record of 19.32 s set at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta would remain intact at the Olympics.[103] Bolt eased through the first and second rounds of the 200 m, jogging towards the end of his run both times.[104] He won his semi-final and progressed to the final as the favourite to win.[105] Retired Jamaican sprinter Don Quarrie praised Bolt, saying he was confident that Johnson's record could be beaten.[44] The following day, at the final, he won Jamaica's fourth gold of the Games, setting a new world and Olympic record of 19.30 s.[106] Johnson's record fell despite the fact that Bolt was impeded by a 0.9\u00a0m/s headwind. The feat made him the first sprinter since Quarrie to hold both 100 m and 200 m world records simultaneously and the first to hold both records since the introduction of electronic timing.[106][107] Furthermore, Bolt became the first sprinter to break both records at the same Olympics.[108] Unlike in the 100 m final, Bolt sprinted hard all the way to the finishing line in the 200 m race, even dipping his chest to improve his time.[109] Following the race, \"Happy Birthday\" was played over the stadium's sound system as his 22nd birthday would begin at midnight.[109] Two days later, Bolt ran as the third leg in the Jamaican 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay team, increasing his gold medal total to three.[110] Along with teammates Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, and Asafa Powell, Bolt broke another world and Olympic record, their 37.10 s finish breaking the previous record by three-tenths of a second.[111] Powell, who anchored the team to the finishing line, lamented the loss of his 100m record to Bolt but showed no animosity towards his Jamaican rival, stating that he was delighted to help him set his third world record.[112] In January 2017 the Jamaican relay teammates were stripped of their gold medals when a blood sample taken from Carter after the race was retested and found positive for a banned substance.[113] Following his victories, Bolt donated US$50,000 to the children of Sichuan province in China to help those harmed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.[114] Bolt's record-setting runs caused commentators not only to praise his achievements but to speculate about his potential to become one of the most successful sprinters in history.[23][115] Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals.[76][116] The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals.[117] All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems.[118][119] Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns.[120][121] The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (Bolt's coach) and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to \"come down and see our programme, come down and see our testing, we have nothing to hide\".[122] Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: \"We will test any time, any day, any part of the body...[he] doesn't even like to take vitamins\".[123] Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, \"We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean\".[124] I was slowing down long before the finish and wasn't tired at all. I could have gone back to the start and done it all over again. At the end of the 2008 athletics season, Bolt competed in the \u00c5F Golden League, beginning in Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich. Despite having the slowest start among his competitors in the 100 m race, he still crossed the finishing line in 9.83 s.[126] Even though the time was slower than both his newly set world record and Asafa Powell's track record, it was still among the top-fifteen 100 m finishes by any sprinter to that date.[90] Bolt admitted that he was not running at full strength because he was suffering from a cold, but he concentrated on winning the race and finishing the season in good health.[126] At the Super Grand Prix final in Lausanne, Bolt ran his second-fastest 200 m with a time of 19.63 s, equalling Xavier Carter's track record.[127] However, it was the 100 m final, featuring Asafa Powell, that drew the most interest. Powell had moved closer to Bolt's world record after setting a new personal best of 9.72 s, reaffirming his status as Bolt's main contender.[128] Bolt's final event of the season came three days later at the Golden League final in Brussels. This was the first 100 m race featuring both Bolt and Powell since the final in the Olympics. Both Jamaicans broke the track record, but Bolt came out on top with a time of 9.77 s, beating Powell by 0.06 s. Victory, however, did not come as smoothly as it had in Beijing. Bolt made the slowest start of the nine competitors and had to recover ground in cold conditions and against a 0.9\u00a0m/s headwind.[129] Yet the results confirmed Jamaican dominance in the 100 m, with nine of the ten-fastest legal times in history being recorded by either Bolt or Powell.[90] On his return to Jamaica, Bolt was honoured in a homecoming celebration and received an Order of Distinction in recognition of his achievements at the Olympics.[130] Additionally, Bolt was selected as the IAAF Male Athlete of the year, won a Special Olympic Award for his performances, and was named Laureus World Sportsman of the Year.[131][132] Bolt turned his attention to future events, suggesting that he could aim to break the 400 metres world record in 2010 as no major championships were scheduled that year.[133] Bolt started the season competing in the 400 metres in order to improve his speed, winning two races and registering 45.54 s in Kingston,[134] and windy conditions gave him his first sub-10 seconds finish of the season in the 100 m in March.[135] In late April Bolt, suffered minor leg injuries in a car crash. However, he quickly recovered following minor surgery and (after cancelling a track meet in Jamaica) he stated that he was fit to compete in the 150 metres street race at the Manchester Great City Games.[136] Bolt won the race in 14.35 s, the fastest time ever recorded for 150 m.[8] Despite not being at full fitness, he took the 100 and 200 m titles at the Jamaican national championships, with runs of 9.86 s and 20.25 s respectively.[137][138] This meant he had qualified for both events at the 2009 World Championships. Rival Tyson Gay suggested that Bolt's 100 m record was within his grasp, but Bolt dismissed the claim and instead noted that he was more interested in Asafa Powell's return from injury.[139] Bolt defied unfavourable conditions at the Athletissima meet in July, running 19.59 seconds into a 0.9\u00a0m/s headwind and rain, to record the fourth fastest time ever over 200 m,[140] one hundredth off Gay's best time.[141] The 2009 World Championships were held during August at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, which was coincidentally the same month and venue where Jesse Owens had achieved world-wide fame 73 years earlier. Bolt eased through the 100-m heats, clocking the fastest ever pre-final performance of 9.89 seconds.[142] The final was the first time that Bolt and Gay had met during the season, and Bolt set a new world record\u2014which stands to this day\u2014with a time of 9.58s to win his first World Championship gold medal.[143] Bolt took more than a tenth of a second off his previous best mark, and this was the largest-ever margin of improvement in the 100-m world record since the beginning of electronic timing.[7] Gay finished with a time of 9.71 s, 0.02 s off Bolt's 9.69 s world-record run in Beijing.[144][145] Although Gay withdrew from the second race of the competition, Bolt once again produced world record-breaking time in the 200 metres final. He broke his own record by 0.11 seconds, finishing with a time of 19.19 seconds.[146] He won the 200 m race by the largest margin in World Championships history, even though the race had three other athletes running under 19.90 seconds, the greatest number ever in the event.[9][147] Bolt's pace impressed even the more experienced of his competitors; third-placed Wallace Spearmon complimented his speed,[148] and the Olympic champion in Athens 2004 Shawn Crawford said \"Just coming out there...I felt like I was in a video game, that guy was moving \u2013 fast\".[149] Bolt pointed out that an important factor in his performance at the World Championships was his improved start to the races: his reaction times in the 100 m (0.146)[150] and 200 m (0.133)[151] were significantly faster than those he had produced in his world record runs at the Beijing Olympics.[152][153] However, he, together with other members of Jamaican 4\u00d7100 m relay team, fell short of their own world record of 37.10 s set at 2008 Summer Olympics by timing 37.31 s, which is, however, a championship record and the second fastest time in history at that date.[154] On the last day of the Berlin Championships, the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, presented Bolt with a 12-foot high section of the Berlin Wall in a small ceremony, saying Bolt had shown that \"one can tear down walls that had been considered as insurmountable.\"[155] The nearly three-ton segment was delivered to the Jamaica Military Museum in Kingston.[156] Several days after Bolt broke the world records in 100 and 200 metres events, Mike Powell, the world record holder in long jump (8.95 metres set in 1991) argued that Bolt could become the first man to jump over 9 metres, the long jump event being \"a perfect fit for his speed and height\".[157] At the end of the season, he was selected as the IAAF World Athlete of the Year for the second year running.[158] Early on in the 2010 outdoor season, Bolt ran 19.56 seconds in the 200 m in Kingston, Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time, although he stated that he had no record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season.[159] He took to the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix.[160][161] Bolt made an attempt to break Michael Johnson's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava. He failed to match Johnson's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet weather had left him with an Achilles tendon problem.[162][163] After his return from injury a month later, Bolt asserted himself with a 100 m win at the Athletissima meeting in Lausanne (9.82 seconds) and a victory over Asafa Powell at Meeting Areva in Paris (9.84 seconds).[164][165] Despite this run of form, he suffered only the second loss of his career in a 100 m final at the DN Galan. Tyson Gay soundly defeated him with a run of 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97 seconds, and the Jamaican reflected that he had slacked off in training early in the season while Gay had been better prepared and in a better condition.[166] This marked Bolt's first loss to Gay in the 100 m, which coincidentally occurred in the same stadium where Powell had beaten Bolt for the first time two years earlier.[167] Bolt went undefeated over 100\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m in the 2011 season. He began with wins in Rome and Ostrava in May.[168] He ran his first 200\u00a0m in over a year in Oslo that June and his time of 19.86 seconds was a world-leading one. Two further 200\u00a0m wins came in Paris and Stockholm the following month, as did a 100\u00a0m in Monaco, though he was a tenth of a second slower than compatriot Asafa Powell before the world championships.[169] Considered the favourite to win in the 100 metres at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Bolt was eliminated from the final, breaking \"ridiculously early\" according to the starter in an interview for BBC Sport, and receiving a false start.[170] This proved to be the highest profile disqualification for a false start since the IAAF changed the rules that previously allowed one false start per race. The disqualification caused some to question the new rule, with former world champion Kim Collins saying it was \"a sad night for athletics\". Usain Bolt's countryman, Yohan Blake, won in a comparatively slow 9.92 seconds.[171] In the World Championships 200 m, Bolt cruised through to the final which he won in a time of 19.40.[172] Though this was short of his world record times of the two previous major tournaments, it was the fourth fastest run ever at that point, after his own records and Michael Johnson's former record, and left him three tenths of a second ahead of runner-up Walter Dix. This achievement made Bolt one of only two men to win consecutive 200\u00a0m world titles, alongside Calvin Smith.[173] Bolt closed the championships with another gold with Jamaica in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay. Nesta Carter and Michael Frater joined world champions Bolt and Blake to set a world record time of 37.04.[174] Following the World Championships, Bolt ran 9.85 seconds for the 100\u00a0m to win in Zagreb before setting the year's best time of 9.76 seconds at the Memorial Van Damme. This run was overshadowed by Jamaican rival Blake's unexpected run of 19.26 seconds in the 200\u00a0m at the same meeting, which brought him within seven hundredths of Bolt's world record.[175] Although Bolt failed to win the Diamond Race in a specific event, he was not beaten on the 2011 IAAF Diamond League circuit, taking three wins in each of his specialities that year.[168][168][176] Bolt began the 2012 season with a leading 100\u00a0m time of 9.82 seconds in May.[177] He defeated Asafa Powell with runs of 9.76 seconds in Rome and 9.79 in Oslo.[178] At the Jamaican Athletics Championships, he lost to Yohan Blake, first in the 200\u00a0m and then in the 100\u00a0m, with his younger rival setting leading times for the year.[179][180] However, at the 2012 London Olympics, he won the 100 metres gold medal with a time of 9.63 seconds, improving upon his own Olympic record and duplicating his gold medal from the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Blake was the silver medallist with a time of 9.75 seconds.[181][182] Following the race, seventh-place finisher Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago declared \"There's no doubt he's the greatest sprinter of all time\", while USA Today referred to Bolt as a Jamaican \"national hero\", noting that his victory came just hours before Jamaica was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its independence from the United Kingdom.[183] With his 2012 win, Bolt became the first man to successfully defend an Olympic sprint title since Carl Lewis in 1988.[184] I'm now a legend. I'm also the greatest athlete to live. Bolt followed this up with a successful defence of his Olympic 200 metres title with a time of 19.32 seconds, followed by Blake at 19.44 and Warren Weir at 19.84 to complete a Jamaican podium sweep. With this, Bolt became the first man in history to defend both the 100 m and 200 m Olympic sprint titles.[186][187] He was dramatic in victory: in the final metres of the 200 m race, Bolt placed his fingers on his lips, gesturing to silence his critics, and after crossing the line he completed five push-ups \u2013 one for each of his Olympic gold medals.[185][188][189] On the final day of the 2012 Olympic athletics, Bolt participated in Jamaica's gold medal-winning 4\u00d7100 metres relay team along with Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Blake. With a time of 36.84 seconds, they knocked two tenths of a second from their previous world record from 2011.[190] He celebrated by imitating the \"Mobot\" celebration of Mo Farah, who had claimed a long-distance track double for the host nation.[191] International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge initially stated that Bolt was not yet a \"legend\" and would not deserve such acclaim until the end of his career,[192] but later called him the best sprinter of all time.[193] Following the Olympics he was confirmed as the highest earning track and field athlete in history.[194] Bolt ended his season with wins on the 2012 IAAF Diamond League circuit; he had 200\u00a0m wins of 19.58 and 19.66 in Lausanne and Z\u00fcrich before closing with a 100\u00a0m of 9.86 in Brussels.[195][196] The latter run brought him his first Diamond League title in the 100\u00a0m.[197] Bolt failed to record below 10 seconds early season and had his first major 100\u00a0m race of 2013 at the Golden Gala in June. He was served an unexpected defeat by Justin Gatlin, with the American winning 9.94 to Bolt's 9.95. Bolt denied the loss was due to a hamstring issue he had early that year and Gatlin responded: \"I don't know how many people have beaten Bolt but it's an honour\".[198][199] With Yohan Blake injured, Bolt won the Jamaican 100\u00a0m title ahead of Kemar Bailey-Cole and skipped the 200\u00a0m, which was won by Warren Weir.[200][201] Prior to the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, Bolt set world leading times in the sprints, with 9.85 for the 100\u00a0m at the London Anniversary Games and 19.73 for the 200\u00a0m in Paris.[202][203] Bolt regained the title as world's fastest man by winning the World Championships 100 metres in Moscow. In wet conditions, he edged Gatlin by eight hundredths of a second with 9.77, which was the fastest run that year.[204][205] Gatlin was the sole non-Jamaican in the top five, with Nesta Carter, Nickel Ashmeade and Bailey-Cole finishing next.[206] Bolt was less challenged in the 200\u00a0m final. His closest rival was Jamaican champion Warren Weir but Bolt ran a time of 19.66 to finish over a tenth of a second clear.[207] This performance made Bolt the first man in the history of the 200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics to win three gold medals over the distance.[208] Bolt won a third consecutive world relay gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay final, which made him the most successful athlete in the 30-year history of the world championships.[209] The Jamaican team, featuring four of the top five from the 100\u00a0m final were comfortable winners with Bolt reaching the finish line on his anchor leg three tenths of a second ahead of the American team anchored by Gatlin.[210] Bolt's performances were matched on the women's side by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, meaning Jamaica took a complete sweep of the sprint medals at the 2013 World Championships.[209] After the championships, Bolt took 100\u00a0m wins on the 2013 IAAF Diamond League circuit in Z\u00fcrich and Brussels. He remained unbeaten in the 200\u00a0m and his only loss that year was to Gatlin over 100\u00a0m in Rome.[211] For the fifth time in six years, Bolt was named IAAF World Male Athlete of the Year.[212] An injury to Bolt's hamstring in March 2014 caused him to miss nine weeks of training. Having recovered from surgery, Bolt competed in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Not in peak form Bolt said that he was attending the Games for the fans and to show his progress since the injury.[213] Bolt and his teammates won the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay in 37.58 seconds \u2013 a Commonwealth Games record.[214] This was the foremost competition of the year for Bolt, given no Olympics or World Championships in 2014. In August 2014, Bolt set the indoor 100\u00a0m world record in Warsaw with a time of 9.98 seconds.[215] This was his sole individual outing of the 2014 season.[216] Soon afterwards he ended his season early in order to be fit for the 2015 season.[217] In Bolt's absence, Justin Gatlin had dominated the sprints, holding the year's fastest times, including seven of the top ten 100\u00a0m runs that season.[216][218] At the start of 2015, he intended to make the 2017 World Championships in Athletics his last major competition before retirement.[219] Upon his return from injury, Bolt appeared a reduced figure at the start of the 2015 season. He ran only two 100\u00a0m and three 200\u00a0m before the major championship. He opened with 10.12 seconds for the 100\u00a0m and 20.20 for the 200\u00a0m. He won the 200\u00a0m in New York and Ostrava, but his season's best time of 20.13 seconds ranked him 20th in the world going into the championships.[220] Two 100\u00a0m runs of 9.87 in July in London showed better form, but in comparison, Justin Gatlin was easily the top ranked sprinter \u2013 the American had times of 9.74 and 19.57 seconds, and had already run under 9.8 seconds on four occasions that season.[220][221] Bolt entered the World Championships to defend his sprint titles but was not the comfortable favourite he had been since 2008.[222][223] In the World Championships 100\u00a0m, Bolt won his semi-final in 9.96, which lagged Gatlin's semi-final win in 9.77 seconds.[221] However, Gatlin did not match that form in the final while Bolt improved through the rounds. In a narrow victory, Bolt leaned at the line to beat Gatlin 9.79 to 9.80 seconds. Bolt joined Carl Lewis and Maurice Greene on a record three 100\u00a0m world titles.[224][225][226] A similar outcome followed in the 200\u00a0m World finals. In the semi-final, Gatlin outpaced Bolt \u2013 the Jamaican at 19.95 and the American at 19.87. Despite such slow times prior to Beijing, Bolt delivered in the final with his fifth fastest run ever for the 200\u00a0m at 19.55 seconds. Gatlin failed to reach his early season form and finished almost two-tenths of a second behind Bolt. Bolt's four consecutive wins over 200\u00a0m at the World Championships was unprecedented and established him clearly as the best ever sprinter at the competition.[227] There was also a fourth straight win in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay with the Jamaica team (Nesta Carter, Asafa Powell, Nickel Ashmeade, Usain Bolt). The Americans initially had a lead, but a poor baton exchange saw them disqualified and Jamaica defend their title in 37.36 seconds \u2013 well clear of the Chinese team who took a surprise silver for the host nation.[228] Conscious of his injuries at the start of the season, he did not compete after the World Championships, skipping the 2015 IAAF Diamond League final.[229] Bolt competed sparingly in the 200\u00a0m before the Olympics, with a run of 19.89 seconds to win at the London Grand Prix being his sole run of note over that distance. He had four races over 100\u00a0m, though only one was in Europe, and his best of 9.88 seconds in Kingston placed him fourth on the world seasonal rankings. As in the previous season, Gatlin appeared to be in better form, having seasonal bests of 9.80 and 19.75 seconds to rank first and second in the sprints.[230][231] Doping in athletics was a prime topic before the 2016 Rio Olympics, given the banning of the Russian track and field team for state doping, and Bolt commented that he had no problem with doping controls: \"I have no issue with being drug-tested...I remember in Beijing every other day they were drug-testing us\". He also highlighted his dislike of rival Tyson Gay's reduced ban for cooperation, given their close rivalry since the start of Bolt's career, saying \"it really bothered me \u2013 really, really bothered me\".[232] I want to be among greats Muhammad Ali and Pel\u00e9. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Bolt won the 100 metres gold medal with a time of 9.81 seconds.[234] With this win, Bolt became the first athlete to win the event three times at the Olympic Games.[234] Bolt followed up his 100 m win with a gold medal in the 200 m, which also makes him the first athlete to win the 200 m three times at the Olympic Games.[235] Bolt ran the anchor leg for the finals of the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay and secured his third consecutive and last Olympic gold medal in the event.[236] With that win, Bolt obtained the \"triple-triple\", three sprinting gold medals in three consecutive Olympics, and finished his Olympic career with a 100% win record in finals.[236] However, in January 2017, Bolt was stripped of the 4 \u00d7 100 relay gold from the Beijing Games in 2008 because his teammate Nesta Carter was found guilty of a doping violation.[237] Bolt took a financial stake in a new Australia-based track and field meeting series \u2013 Nitro Athletics. He performed at the inaugural meet in February 2017 and led his team (Bolt All-Stars) to victory. The competition featured variations on traditional track and field events. He committed himself to three further editions.[238][239] In 2017, the Jamaican team was stripped of the 2008 Olympics 4\u00d7100 metre title due to Nesta Carter's disqualification for doping offences. Bolt, who never failed a dope test, was quoted by the BBC saying that the prospect of having to return the gold was \"heartbreaking.\"[240] The banned substance in Carter's test was identified as methylhexanamine, a nasal decongestant sometimes used in dietary supplements. At the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt won his heat uncomfortably after a slow start in 10.07, in his semi-final he improved to 9.98 but was beaten by Christian Coleman by 0.01. That race broke Bolt's 4 year winning streak in the 100\u00a0m. In his final individual race, in the final, Bolt won the Bronze medal in 9.95, 0.01 behind Silver medalist Coleman and 0.03 behind World Champion Justin Gatlin. It was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championship since the 4\u00d7100 m relay of the 2007 World Athletics Championships. Also at the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt participated as the anchor runner for Jamaica's 4\u00d7100-metre relay team in both the heats and the final. Jamaica won their heat comfortably in 37.95 seconds. In what was intended to be his final race, Bolt pulled up in agony with 50 metres to go and collapsed to the track after what was later confirmed to be another hamstring injury. He refused a wheelchair and crossed the finish line one last time with the assistance of his teammates Omar McLeod, Julian Forte, and Yohan Blake.[241] In an interview with Decca Aitkenhead of The Guardian in November 2016, Bolt said he wished to play as a professional footballer after retiring from track and field. He reiterated his desire to play for Manchester United if given a chance and added, \"For me, if I could get to play for Manchester United, that would be like a dream come true. Yes, that would be epic.\"[242] In 2018, after training with Norwegian side Str\u00f8msgodset,[243] Bolt played for the club as a forward in a friendly match against the Norway national under-19 team. He wore the number \"9.58\" in allusion to his 100 m world record.[244] Bolt wore the same number whilst captaining the World XI during Soccer Aid 2018 at Old Trafford.[245] On 21 August 2018, on his 32nd birthday, Bolt started training with Australian club Central Coast Mariners of the A-League.[246] He made his friendly debut for the club as a substitute on 31 August 2018 against a Central Coast Select team, made up of players playing in the local area.[247] On 12 October, he started in a friendly against amateur club Macarthur South West United and scored two goals, both in the second half, with his goal celebration featuring his signature \u201cTo Di World\u201d pose.[248][249] Bolt was offered a two-year contract from Maltese club Valletta, which he turned down on 18 October 2018.[250] On 21 October 2018, Bolt was offered a contract by the Mariners.[251] The Australian FA was helping the Mariners to fund it.[252] Later that month, Perth Glory forward Andy Keogh was critical of Bolt's ability, stating his first touch is \"like a trampoline.\" He added Bolt has \"shown a bit of potential but it's a little bit of a kick in the teeth to the professionals that are in the league.\"[253] Bolt left the Mariners in early November 2018 after 8 weeks with the club.[254] In January 2019, Bolt decided not to pursue a career in football, saying his \"sports life is over.\"[255] Bolt expresses a love for dancing and his character is frequently described as laid-back and relaxed.[25][256] His Jamaican track and field idols include Herb McKenley and former Jamaican 100\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m world record holder, Don Quarrie. Michael Johnson, the former 200 m world and Olympic record holder, is also held in high esteem by Bolt.[25] Bolt has the nickname \"Lightning Bolt\" due to his name and speed.[1] He is Catholic and known for making the sign of the cross before racing competitively, and he wears a Miraculous Medal during his races. His middle name is St. Leo.[257] In 2010, Bolt also revealed his fondness of music, when he played a reggae DJ set to a crowd in Paris.[258] He is also an avid fan of the Call of Duty video game series, saying, \"I stay up late [playing the game online], I can't help it.\"[259] In his autobiography, Bolt reveals that he has suffered from scoliosis, a condition that has curved his spine to the right and has made his right leg half an inch shorter than his left.[260] A result of this is that his left leg remains on the ground 14 percent longer than his right leg, with left leg striking with 955 lbs of force and right with 1080 lbs. Biomechanics researchers have studied, with no firm conclusions, whether this asymmetry has helped or hurt Bolt in his sprinting career.[261] He popularised the \"lightning bolt\" pose, also known as \"to di world\" or \"bolting\", which he used both before races and in celebration. The pose consists of extending a slightly raised left arm to the side and the right arm folded across the chest, with both hands have the thumb and index finger outstretched. His performance of the pose during his Olympic and World Championship victories led to widespread copying of the move, from American President Barack Obama to small children. It has been suggested that the pose comes from Jamaican dancehall moves of the period,[262][263] though Olympic sprint champion Bernard Williams also had performed similar celebration moves earlier that decade.[264] Cricket was the first sport to interest Bolt, and he said if he were not a sprinter, he would be a fast bowler instead.[25] As a child, he was a supporter of the Pakistani cricket team and admired the bowling of Waqar Younis.[265] He is also a fan of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar, West Indian opener Chris Gayle,[266] and Australian opener Matthew Hayden.[267] During a charity cricket match, Bolt clean-bowled Gayle who was complimentary of Bolt's pace and swing.[268] Bolt also struck a six off Gayle's bowling. Another bowler complimentary of Bolt's pace was former West Indies fast-bowling great Curtly Ambrose.[269] After talking with Australian cricketer Shane Warne, Bolt suggested that if he were able to get time off he would be interested in playing in the cricket Big Bash League. Melbourne Stars chief executive Clint Cooper said there were free spots on his team should be available. Bolt stated that he enjoyed the Twenty20 version of the game, admiring the aggressive and constant nature of the batting. On his own ability, he said \"I don't know how good I am. I will probably have to get a lot of practice in.\"[270][271] Bolt is also a fan of Premier League football team Manchester United.[272] He has declared he is a fan of Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.[273] Bolt was a special guest of Manchester United at the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final in London, where he stated that he would like to play for them after his retirement.[274] In 2013, Bolt played basketball in the NBA All-Star Weekend Celebrity Game. He scored two points from a slam dunk but acknowledged his other basketball skills were lacking.[275] A biographical film based on the athletic life of Bolt to win three Olympic gold medals, titled I Am Bolt, was released on 28 November 2016 in United Kingdom. The film was directed by Benjamin Turner and Gabe Turner.[276][277] After winning the 200 m title in the 2002 World Junior Championships in Kingston, Bolt signed a sponsorship deal with Puma.[278] To promote Bolt's chase for Olympic glory in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Puma released a series of videos including Bolt's then-world-record-setting run in Icahn Stadium and his Olympic preparations.[279] After his record-breaking run in New York City, which was preceded by a lightning storm,[280] the press frequently made puns on the Jamaican's name, nicknaming him \"Lightning Bolt\" and the \"Bolt from the blue\".[281][282][283] During the 2008 Beijing 100 m final, Bolt wore golden Puma Complete Theseus spikes that had \"Beijing 100 m Gold\" emblazoned across them.[284] Writing of Bolt's performance at the Olympics, The Associated Press said: Almost single-handedly, Bolt has helped track transform itself from a dying sport to one with a singular, smiling, worldwide star. In September 2010, Bolt travelled to Australia where his sponsor Gatorade was holding an event called the \"Gatorade Bolt\" to find Australia's fastest footballer. The event was held at the Sydney International Athletic Centre and featured football players from rugby league, rugby union, Australian rules football, and association football. Prior to the race Bolt gave the runners some private coaching and also participated in the 10th anniversary celebrations for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.[285] In January 2012, Bolt impersonated Richard Branson in an advertising campaign for Virgin Media.[286] The campaign was directed by Seth Gordon and features the Virgin founder Branson to promote its broadband service. In March 2012, Bolt starred in an advert for Visa and the 2012 Summer Olympics.[287] In July 2012, Bolt and RockLive launched Bolt!, an Apple iOS game based on his exploits. Bolt! quickly became the No. 1 app in Jamaica and climbed the UK iTunes charts to reach No. 2 on the list of Top Free Apps.[288] Bolt's autobiography, My Story: 9.58: Being the World's Fastest Man, was released in 2010. Bolt had previously said that the book \"...should be exciting, it's my life, and I'm a cool and exciting guy.\"[272] His athletics agent is PACE Sports Management.[289] As part of his sponsorship deal with Puma, the manufacturer sends sporting equipment to his alma mater, William Knibb Memorial High School, every year. At Bolt's insistence, advertisements featuring him are filmed in Jamaica, by a Jamaican production crew, in an attempt to boost local enterprise and gain exposure for the country.[290] In 2017, Bolt had the third highest earning social media income for sponsors among sportspeople (behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar), and he was the only non-footballer in the top seven.[291] Usain Bolt co-founded electric scooter company Bolt Mobility in 2018, created in his namesake.[292] Bolt founded the micromobility company, which provides electric scooters and other yet-to-be released mobility devices, such as the company's upcoming Bolt Nano. Bolt appeared in Bolt Mobility's debut commercial, released through YouTube and his official Facebook account.[293] Bolt appeared in a number of interviews for the company, alongside CEO Sarah Pishevar Haynes. Bolt made his first public appearance for the company in March 2019, during the company's New York City launch and in CNBC interviews on the NYSE.[294] In May 2019, the company expanded its services to Europe, introducing the product first in Paris.[295] In May 2019, Bolt spoke in Paris at the Viva Technology conference, where he introduced the company's future release of the Nano minicar.[296] He also met with French president Emmanuel Macron while at the conference. While in France, Bolt participated in a CNN interview where he revealed his reasons for founding the company.[297] Usain Bolt, CNN Interview Bolt argues that his scooter is different, which allows bag, shopping and mobile phone storage. The scooters have capabilities to reach up to 30 MPH, but are typically capped at 15 MPH depending on city regulation. The company has begun operations in a number of U.S. cities, and plans to expand throughout Europe and Asia. In July 2019, Bolt made his debut as a dancehall music producer with the release of the Olympe Ros\u00e9 riddim that featured 5 tracks from Jamaican dancehall artistes: Dexta Daps \"Big Moves\", Munga Honorable \"Weekend\", Christopher Martin \"Dweet\", Ding Dong \"Top A Di Top\" and football player tuned artist Ricardo \"Bibi\" Gardner \"Mount A Gyal\".[298] In November 2019, he followed up with another compilation called the 'Immortal Riddim' that included tracks from Vybz Kartel, Masicka, Munga Honorable and Christopher Martin.[299][300] Bolt made a cameo appearance in the opening sketch of 13 October 2012 broadcast of Saturday Night Live, hosted by Christina Applegate. The segment was a parody of the Vice Presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. In the sketch, Taran Killam mimicking Ryan had just lied about running a 2:50 marathon, a sub-4-minute mile on no training and winning the 100 metres in London when Bolt was introduced as his partner to confirm. When Ryan asked Bolt \"Who won the 100 metres?\" the Jamaican gold-medallist answered simply. \"I did.\" Ryan followed up by asking Bolt about his (Ryan's) finish. \"You didn't finish. You weren't even there.\"[312][313] On 23 November 2016, Bolt competed against James Corden in a rap battle on the \"Drop the Mic\" segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden, which he won. Bolt's personal best of 9.58 seconds in 2009 in the 100 metres is the fastest ever run.[314] Bolt also holds the second fastest time of 9.63 seconds,[88] the current Olympic record,[90] and set two previous world records in the event. Bolt's personal best of 19.19 s in the 200 metres is the world record. This was recorded at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin against a headwind of \u22120.3\u00a0m/s. This performance broke his previous world record in the event, his 19.30 s clocking in winning the 2008 Olympic 200 metres title. Bolt has been on three world-record-setting Jamaican relay teams. The first record, 37.10 seconds, was set in winning gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics, although the result was voided in 2017 when the team was disqualified. The second record came at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, a time of 37.04 seconds. The third world record was set at the 2012 Summer Olympics, a time of 36.84 seconds.[315] Bolt also holds the 200 metres world teenage best results for the age categories 15 (20.58 s), 16 (20.13 s, world youth record), 17 (19.93 s) and 18 (19.93 s, world junior record).[88] He also holds the 150 metres world best set in 2009, during which he ran the last 100 metres in 8.70 seconds, the quickest timed 100 metres ever.[88] Bolt completed a total of 53 wind-legal sub-10-second performances in the 100\u00a0m during his career, with his first coming on 3 May 2008 and his last on 5 August 2017 at the World Championships. His longest undefeated streak in the 200\u00a0m was in 17 finals, lasting from 12 June 2008 to 3 September 2011. He also had a win-streak covering 14 100\u00a0m finals from 16 August 2008 to 16 July 2010.[316] Bolt claimed 19 Guinness World Records, and, after Michael Phelps, holds second highest number of accumulative Guinness World Records for total number of accomplishments and victories in the sport.[317] From his record time of 9.58 s for the 100 m sprint, Usain Bolt's average ground speed equates to 37.58\u00a0km/h (23.35\u00a0mph). However, once his reaction time of 0.148 s is subtracted, his time is 9.44 s, making his average speed 38.18\u00a0km/h (23.72\u00a0mph).[143] Bolt's top speed, based on his split time of 1.61 s for the 20 metres from the 60- to 80-metre marks (made during the 9.58 WR at 100m), is 12.42\u00a0m/s (44.72\u00a0km/h (27.79\u00a0mph)).[318] World rank in parentheses",

He is a world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay. Owing to his achievements and dominance in sprint competition, he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time.[13][14][15][16]\nAn eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200\u00a0m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016). In addition he won two 4 \u00d7 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic time became mandatory. \nAn eleven-time World Champion, he won consecutive World Championship 100\u00a0m, 200\u00a0m and 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100\u00a0m false start in 2011. He is the most successful athlete of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200\u00a0m and is the joint-most successful in the 100\u00a0m with three titles.\nBolt improved upon his second 100\u00a0m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 \u2013 the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the 200 metres world record, setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay world records, with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100\u00a0m; he had earlier won numerous 200\u00a0m medals (including 2007 World Championship silver) and holds the world under-20 and world under-18 records for the event.\nHis achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname \"Lightning Bolt\", and his awards include the IAAF World Athlete of the Year, Track &amp; Field Athlete of the Year, BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year (three times) and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year (four times). Bolt retired after the 2017 World Championships, when he finished third in his last solo 100\u00a0m race, opted out of the 200\u00a0m, and pulled up in the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m relay final.\nStating that it was his \"dream\" to play professional association football, in August 2018 Bolt began training with Australian A-League club the Central Coast Mariners as a left-winger. On 12 October 2018, Bolt scored twice for the team in a friendly match. He left the club the following month, and in January 2019 chose not to pursue a career in football.[17]\nBolt was born on 21 August 1986 to parents Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt[10] in Sherwood Content,[18] a small town in Jamaica. He has a brother, Sadiki,[19] and a sister, Sherine.[20][21] His parents ran the local grocery store in the rural area, and Bolt spent his time playing cricket and football in the street with his brother,[22] later saying, \"When I was young, I didn't really think about anything other than sports.\"[23] As a child, Bolt attended Waldensia Primary, where he began showing his sprint potential when he ran in his parish's annual national primary school meet.[1] By the age of twelve, Bolt had become the school's fastest runner over the 100 metres distance.[24]\nUpon his entry to William Knibb Memorial High School, Bolt continued to focus on other sports, but his cricket coach noticed Bolt's speed on the pitch and urged him to try track and field events.[25] Pablo McNeil, a former Olympic sprint athlete,[26] and Dwayne Jarrett coached Bolt,[27] encouraging him to focus his energy on improving his athletic abilities. The school had a history of success in athletics with past students, including sprinter Michael Green.[1] Bolt won his first annual high school championships medal in 2001; he took the silver medal in the 200 metres with a time of 22.04 seconds.[1] McNeil soon became his primary coach, and the two enjoyed a positive partnership, although McNeil was occasionally frustrated by Bolt's lack of dedication to his training and his penchant for practical jokes.[26]\nWhen Bolt was a boy, he attended Sherwood Content Seventh-day Adventist Church in Trelawny, Jamaica, with his mother. His mother didn't serve pork to him in accordance with Adventist beliefs.[28]\nPerforming for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the 400 metres in the 2001 CARIFTA Games, winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.[29]\nHe made his first appearance on the world stage at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s.[30] Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident.[26] However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively.[29] He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.[31]\nBolt is one of only nine athletes (along with Valerie Adams, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels, David Storl, and Kirani James) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. Former Prime Minister P. J. Patterson recognised Bolt's talent and arranged for him to move to Kingston, along with Jermaine Gonzales, so he could train with the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) at the University of Technology, Jamaica.[26]\nThe 2002 World Junior Championships were held in front of a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and Bolt was given a chance to prove his credentials on a world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to 1.96 metres (6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) tall, and he physically stood out among his peers.[1] He won the 200 m in a time of 20.61 s,[32] which was 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, which he set in the 1st round.[33] Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever.[34] The expectation from the home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet, although he realized the mistake before the race began[35]. However, it turned out to be a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves.[36] As a member of the Jamaican sprint relay team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the 4\u00d7100 metres and 4\u00d7400 metres relay, running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively.[37][38]\nThe rush of medals continued as he won four golds at the 2003 CARIFTA Games and was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the most outstanding athlete of the games.[39][40][41] He won another gold at the 2003 World Youth Championships. He set a new championship record in the 200 m with a time of 20.40 s, despite a 1.1 m/s head wind.[42] Michael Johnson, the 200 m world-record holder, took note of Bolt's potential but worried that the young sprinter might be over-pressured, stating, \"It's all about what he does three, four, five years down the line\".[43] Bolt had also impressed the athletics hierarchy, and he received the IAAF Rising Star Award for 2002.[44]\nBolt competed in his final Jamaican High School Championships in 2003. He broke the 200 m and 400 m records with times of 20.25 s and 45.35 s, respectively. Bolt's runs were a significant improvement upon the previous records, beating the 200 m best by more than half a second and the 400 m record by almost a second.[1] While Bolt improved upon the 200 m time three months later, setting the still-standing World youth best at the 2003 Pan American Junior Championships.[45] The 400 m time remains No. 6 on the all-time youth list, surpassed only once since, by future Olympic champion Kirani James.[46]\nBolt turned his main focus to the 200 m and equalled Roy Martin's world junior record of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships.[1][47] This performance attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time was superior to Maurice Greene's season's best that year.[43]\nBolt was growing more popular in his homeland. Howard Hamilton, who was given the task of Public Defender by the government, urged the JAAA to nurture him and prevent burnout, calling Bolt \"the most phenomenal sprinter ever produced by this island\".[43] His popularity and the attractions of the capital city were beginning to be a burden to the young sprinter. Bolt was increasingly unfocused on his athletic career and preferred to eat fast food, play basketball, and party in Kingston's club scene. In the absence of a disciplined lifestyle, he became ever-more reliant on his natural ability to beat his competitors on the track.[48]\nAs the reigning 200 m champion at both the World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the Senior World Championships in Paris.[1] He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that, even if he did not make the final, he would consider setting a personal best a success.[43][49] However, he suffered a bout of conjunctivitis before the event, and it ruined his training schedule.[1] Realising that he would not be in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead.[49] Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run.[44][50]\nUnder the guidance of new coach Fitz Coleman, Bolt turned professional in 2004, beginning with the CARIFTA Games in Bermuda.[1] He became the first junior sprinter to run the 200 m in under twenty seconds, taking the world junior record outright with a time of 19.93 s.[1][34] For the second time in the role, he was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the most outstanding athlete of the 2004 CARIFTA Games.[39][40][51] A hamstring injury in May ruined Bolt's chances of competing in the 2004 World Junior Championships, but he was still chosen for the Jamaican Olympic squad.[52] Bolt headed to the 2004 Athens Olympics with confidence and a new record on his side. However, he was hampered by a leg injury and was eliminated in the first round of the 200 metres with a disappointing time of 21.05 s.[10][53] American colleges offered Bolt track scholarships to train in the United States while continuing to represent Jamaica on the international stage, but the teenager from Trelawny refused them all, stating that he was content to stay in his homeland of Jamaica.[21] Bolt instead chose the surroundings of the University of Technology, Jamaica, as his professional training ground, staying with the university's track and weight room that had served him well in his amateur years.[54]\nThe year 2005 signalled a fresh start for Bolt in the form of a new coach, Glen Mills, and a new attitude toward athletics. Mills recognised Bolt's potential and aimed to cease what he considered an unprofessional approach to the sport.[53] Bolt began training with Mills in preparation for the upcoming athletics season, partnering with more seasoned sprinters such as Kim Collins and Dwain Chambers.[55] The year began well, and in July, he knocked more than a third of a second off the 200 m CAC Championship record with a run of 20.03 s,[56] then registered his 200 m season's best at London's Crystal Palace, running in 19.99 s.[10]\nMisfortune awaited Bolt at the next major event, the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much improved since the 2004 Olympics, and he saw the World Championships as a way to live up to expectations, stating, \"I really want to make up for what happened in Athens. Hopefully, everything will fall into place\".[57] Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s, but he suffered an injury in the final, finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s.[53][58] Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season, and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions.[59] However, his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final.[60] Bolt was involved in a car accident in November, and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations, his training schedule was further upset.[61][62] His manager, Norman Peart, made Bolt's training less intensive, and he had fully recuperated the following week.[61] Bolt had continued to improve his performances, and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006.[1] Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his primary event by 2007 or 2008. Bolt was less enthusiastic, and demanded that he feel comfortable in his sprinting.[61][63] He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006, forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and he did not return to track events until May.[64] After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold.[59]\nThe 200 m remained Bolt's primary event when he returned to competition; he bested Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, despite the fact that bad weather had impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory.[65] However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal.[66] Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was more keen on competing over longer distances, setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.[65]\nBolt claimed his first major world medal two months later at the IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart, Germany. He passed the finishing post with a time of 20.10 s, gaining a bronze medal in the process.[10] The IAAF World Cup in Athens, Greece, yielded Bolt's first senior international silver medal.[10] Wallace Spearmon from the United States won gold with a championship record time of 19.87 s, beating Bolt's respectable time of 19.96 s.[67] Further 200 m honours on both the regional and international stages awaited Bolt in 2007. He yearned to run in the 100 metres but Mills was skeptical, believing that Bolt was better suited for middle distances. The coach cited the runner's difficulty in smoothly starting out of the blocks and poor habits such as looking back at opponents in sprints. Mills told Bolt that he could run the shorter distance if he broke the 200 m national record.[53] In the Jamaican Championships, he ran 19.75 s in the 200 m, breaking the 36-year-old Jamaican record held by Don Quarrie by 0.11 s.[1][21]\nMills complied with Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m, and he was entered to run the event at the 23rd Vardinoyiannia meeting in Rethymno, Crete. In his debut tournament, he won the gold medal in a time of 10.03 s, feeding his enthusiasm for the event.[21][68]\nHe built on this achievement at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, winning a silver medal.[10] Bolt recorded 19.91 s with a headwind of 0.8 m/s. The race was won by Tyson Gay in 19.76 s, a new championship record.[69]\nBolt was a member of the silver medal relay team with Asafa Powell, Marvin Anderson, and Nesta Carter in the 4\u00d7100 metres relay. Jamaica set a national record of 37.89 s.[70] Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's technique was much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in his stride frequency, giving him more driving power on the track.[53]\nThe silver medals from the 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to sprint, and he took a more serious, more mature stance towards his career.[25] Bolt continued to develop in the 100 m, and he decided to compete in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s tail wind, improving his personal best from 10.03 s.[71] This was the second-fastest legal performance in the history of the event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy.[72] Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, especially praising Bolt's form and technique.[73] Michael Johnson observed the race and said that he was shocked at how quickly Bolt had improved over the 100 m distance.[74] The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident that there was more to come.[73]\nOn 31 May 2008, Bolt set a new 100\u00a0m world record at the Reebok Grand Prix in the Icahn Stadium in New York City. He ran 9.72s with a tail wind of 1.7\u00a0m/s.[75] This race was Bolt's fifth senior 100 m.[76] Gay again finished second and said of Bolt: \"It looked like his knees were going past my face.\"[21] Commentators noted that Bolt appeared to have gained a psychological advantage over fellow Olympic contender Gay.[53]\nIn June 2008, Bolt responded to claims that he was a lazy athlete, saying that the comments were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event; he chose not to make an effort to train for that particular distance.[77] Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in two events\u2014first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece.[78][79] Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.[21][80][81]\nBolt doubled-up with the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the Beijing Summer Olympics. As the new 100 m world-record holder, he was the favourite to win both races.[82][83] Michael Johnson, the 200 m and 400 m record holder, personally backed the sprinter, saying that he did not believe that a lack of experience would work against him.[84] Bolt qualified for the 100 m final with times of 9.92 s and 9.85 s in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.[85][86][87]\n\u2014Tom Hammond, NBC Sports, with the call for the men's 100 metres final at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nIn the Olympic 100 m final, Bolt broke new ground, winning in 9.69 s (unofficially 9.683 s) with a reaction time of 0.165 s.[88] This was an improvement upon his own world record, and he was well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson, who finished in 9.89 s.[89] Not only was the record set without a favourable wind (+0.0\u00a0m/s), but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his shoelace was untied.[90][91][92] Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished with a time of 9.52 s.[93] After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time. Considering factors such as Bolt's position, acceleration and velocity in comparison with second-place-finisher Thompson, the team estimated that Bolt could have finished in 9.55\u00b10.04 s had he not slowed to celebrate before the finishing line.[94][95]\nBolt stated that setting a world record was not a priority for him, and that his goal was just to win the gold medal, Jamaica's first of the 2008 Games.[96] Olympic medallist Kriss Akabusi construed Bolt's chest slapping before the finish line as showboating, noting that the actions cost Bolt an even faster record time.[97] IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful.[98][99] Bolt denied that this was the purpose of his celebration by saying, \"I wasn't bragging. When I saw I wasn't covered, I was just happy\".[100] Lamine Diack, president of the IAAF, supported Bolt and said that his celebration was appropriate given the circumstances of his victory. Jamaican government minister Edmund Bartlett also defended Bolt's actions, stating, \"We have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them. We have to allow the personality of youth to express itself\".[101]\nBolt then focused on attaining a gold medal in the 200 m event, aiming to emulate Carl Lewis' double win in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.[102] Michael Johnson felt that Bolt would easily win gold but believed that his own world record of 19.32 s set at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta would remain intact at the Olympics.[103] Bolt eased through the first and second rounds of the 200 m, jogging towards the end of his run both times.[104] He won his semi-final and progressed to the final as the favourite to win.[105] Retired Jamaican sprinter Don Quarrie praised Bolt, saying he was confident that Johnson's record could be beaten.[44] The following day, at the final, he won Jamaica's fourth gold of the Games, setting a new world and Olympic record of 19.30 s.[106] Johnson's record fell despite the fact that Bolt was impeded by a 0.9\u00a0m/s headwind. The feat made him the first sprinter since Quarrie to hold both 100 m and 200 m world records simultaneously and the first to hold both records since the introduction of electronic timing.[106][107] Furthermore, Bolt became the first sprinter to break both records at the same Olympics.[108] Unlike in the 100 m final, Bolt sprinted hard all the way to the finishing line in the 200 m race, even dipping his chest to improve his time.[109] Following the race, \"Happy Birthday\" was played over the stadium's sound system as his 22nd birthday would begin at midnight.[109]\nTwo days later, Bolt ran as the third leg in the Jamaican 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay team, increasing his gold medal total to three.[110] Along with teammates Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, and Asafa Powell, Bolt broke another world and Olympic record, their 37.10 s finish breaking the previous record by three-tenths of a second.[111] Powell, who anchored the team to the finishing line, lamented the loss of his 100m record to Bolt but showed no animosity towards his Jamaican rival, stating that he was delighted to help him set his third world record.[112] In January 2017 the Jamaican relay teammates were stripped of their gold medals when a blood sample taken from Carter after the race was retested and found positive for a banned substance.[113] Following his victories, Bolt donated US$50,000 to the children of Sichuan province in China to help those harmed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.[114]\nBolt's record-setting runs caused commentators not only to praise his achievements but to speculate about his potential to become one of the most successful sprinters in history.[23][115] Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals.[76][116] The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals.[117] All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems.[118][119] Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns.[120][121] The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (Bolt's coach) and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to \"come down and see our programme, come down and see our testing, we have nothing to hide\".[122] Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: \"We will test any time, any day, any part of the body...[he] doesn't even like to take vitamins\".[123] Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, \"We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean\".[124]\nI was slowing down long before the finish and wasn't tired at all. I could have gone back to the start and done it all over again.\nAt the end of the 2008 athletics season, Bolt competed in the \u00c5F Golden League, beginning in Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich. Despite having the slowest start among his competitors in the 100 m race, he still crossed the finishing line in 9.83 s.[126] Even though the time was slower than both his newly set world record and Asafa Powell's track record, it was still among the top-fifteen 100 m finishes by any sprinter to that date.[90] Bolt admitted that he was not running at full strength because he was suffering from a cold, but he concentrated on winning the race and finishing the season in good health.[126] At the Super Grand Prix final in Lausanne, Bolt ran his second-fastest 200 m with a time of 19.63 s, equalling Xavier Carter's track record.[127] However, it was the 100 m final, featuring Asafa Powell, that drew the most interest. Powell had moved closer to Bolt's world record after setting a new personal best of 9.72 s, reaffirming his status as Bolt's main contender.[128] Bolt's final event of the season came three days later at the Golden League final in Brussels. This was the first 100 m race featuring both Bolt and Powell since the final in the Olympics. Both Jamaicans broke the track record, but Bolt came out on top with a time of 9.77 s, beating Powell by 0.06 s. Victory, however, did not come as smoothly as it had in Beijing. Bolt made the slowest start of the nine competitors and had to recover ground in cold conditions and against a 0.9\u00a0m/s headwind.[129] Yet the results confirmed Jamaican dominance in the 100 m, with nine of the ten-fastest legal times in history being recorded by either Bolt or Powell.[90]\nOn his return to Jamaica, Bolt was honoured in a homecoming celebration and received an Order of Distinction in recognition of his achievements at the Olympics.[130] Additionally, Bolt was selected as the IAAF Male Athlete of the year, won a Special Olympic Award for his performances, and was named Laureus World Sportsman of the Year.[131][132] Bolt turned his attention to future events, suggesting that he could aim to break the 400 metres world record in 2010 as no major championships were scheduled that year.[133]\nBolt started the season competing in the 400 metres in order to improve his speed, winning two races and registering 45.54 s in Kingston,[134] and windy conditions gave him his first sub-10 seconds finish of the season in the 100 m in March.[135] In late April Bolt, suffered minor leg injuries in a car crash. However, he quickly recovered following minor surgery and (after cancelling a track meet in Jamaica) he stated that he was fit to compete in the 150 metres street race at the Manchester Great City Games.[136] Bolt won the race in 14.35 s, the fastest time ever recorded for 150 m.[8] Despite not being at full fitness, he took the 100 and 200 m titles at the Jamaican national championships, with runs of 9.86 s and 20.25 s respectively.[137][138] This meant he had qualified for both events at the 2009 World Championships. Rival Tyson Gay suggested that Bolt's 100 m record was within his grasp, but Bolt dismissed the claim and instead noted that he was more interested in Asafa Powell's return from injury.[139] Bolt defied unfavourable conditions at the Athletissima meet in July, running 19.59 seconds into a 0.9\u00a0m/s headwind and rain, to record the fourth fastest time ever over 200 m,[140] one hundredth off Gay's best time.[141]\nThe 2009 World Championships were held during August at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, which was coincidentally the same month and venue where Jesse Owens had achieved world-wide fame 73 years earlier. Bolt eased through the 100-m heats, clocking the fastest ever pre-final performance of 9.89 seconds.[142] The final was the first time that Bolt and Gay had met during the season, and Bolt set a new world record\u2014which stands to this day\u2014with a time of 9.58s to win his first World Championship gold medal.[143] Bolt took more than a tenth of a second off his previous best mark, and this was the largest-ever margin of improvement in the 100-m world record since the beginning of electronic timing.[7] Gay finished with a time of 9.71 s, 0.02 s off Bolt's 9.69 s world-record run in Beijing.[144][145]\nAlthough Gay withdrew from the second race of the competition, Bolt once again produced world record-breaking time in the 200 metres final. He broke his own record by 0.11 seconds, finishing with a time of 19.19 seconds.[146] He won the 200 m race by the largest margin in World Championships history, even though the race had three other athletes running under 19.90 seconds, the greatest number ever in the event.[9][147] Bolt's pace impressed even the more experienced of his competitors; third-placed Wallace Spearmon complimented his speed,[148] and the Olympic champion in Athens 2004 Shawn Crawford said \"Just coming out there...I felt like I was in a video game, that guy was moving \u2013 fast\".[149] Bolt pointed out that an important factor in his performance at the World Championships was his improved start to the races: his reaction times in the 100 m (0.146)[150] and 200 m (0.133)[151] were significantly faster than those he had produced in his world record runs at the Beijing Olympics.[152][153] However, he, together with other members of Jamaican 4\u00d7100 m relay team, fell short of their own world record of 37.10 s set at 2008 Summer Olympics by timing 37.31 s, which is, however, a championship record and the second fastest time in history at that date.[154]\nOn the last day of the Berlin Championships, the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, presented Bolt with a 12-foot high section of the Berlin Wall in a small ceremony, saying Bolt had shown that \"one can tear down walls that had been considered as insurmountable.\"[155] The nearly three-ton segment was delivered to the Jamaica Military Museum in Kingston.[156]\nSeveral days after Bolt broke the world records in 100 and 200 metres events, Mike Powell, the world record holder in long jump (8.95 metres set in 1991) argued that Bolt could become the first man to jump over 9 metres, the long jump event being \"a perfect fit for his speed and height\".[157] At the end of the season, he was selected as the IAAF World Athlete of the Year for the second year running.[158]\nEarly on in the 2010 outdoor season, Bolt ran 19.56 seconds in the 200 m in Kingston, Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time, although he stated that he had no record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season.[159] He took to the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix.[160][161] Bolt made an attempt to break Michael Johnson's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava. He failed to match Johnson's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet weather had left him with an Achilles tendon problem.[162][163]\nAfter his return from injury a month later, Bolt asserted himself with a 100 m win at the Athletissima meeting in Lausanne (9.82 seconds) and a victory over Asafa Powell at Meeting Areva in Paris (9.84 seconds).[164][165] Despite this run of form, he suffered only the second loss of his career in a 100 m final at the DN Galan. Tyson Gay soundly defeated him with a run of 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97 seconds, and the Jamaican reflected that he had slacked off in training early in the season while Gay had been better prepared and in a better condition.[166] This marked Bolt's first loss to Gay in the 100 m, which coincidentally occurred in the same stadium where Powell had beaten Bolt for the first time two years earlier.[167]\nBolt went undefeated over 100\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m in the 2011 season. He began with wins in Rome and Ostrava in May.[168] He ran his first 200\u00a0m in over a year in Oslo that June and his time of 19.86 seconds was a world-leading one. Two further 200\u00a0m wins came in Paris and Stockholm the following month, as did a 100\u00a0m in Monaco, though he was a tenth of a second slower than compatriot Asafa Powell before the world championships.[169]\nConsidered the favourite to win in the 100 metres at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Bolt was eliminated from the final, breaking \"ridiculously early\" according to the starter in an interview for BBC Sport, and receiving a false start.[170] This proved to be the highest profile disqualification for a false start since the IAAF changed the rules that previously allowed one false start per race. The disqualification caused some to question the new rule, with former world champion Kim Collins saying it was \"a sad night for athletics\". Usain Bolt's countryman, Yohan Blake, won in a comparatively slow 9.92 seconds.[171]\nIn the World Championships 200 m, Bolt cruised through to the final which he won in a time of 19.40.[172] Though this was short of his world record times of the two previous major tournaments, it was the fourth fastest run ever at that point, after his own records and Michael Johnson's former record, and left him three tenths of a second ahead of runner-up Walter Dix. This achievement made Bolt one of only two men to win consecutive 200\u00a0m world titles, alongside Calvin Smith.[173] Bolt closed the championships with another gold with Jamaica in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay. Nesta Carter and Michael Frater joined world champions Bolt and Blake to set a world record time of 37.04.[174]\nFollowing the World Championships, Bolt ran 9.85 seconds for the 100\u00a0m to win in Zagreb before setting the year's best time of 9.76 seconds at the Memorial Van Damme. This run was overshadowed by Jamaican rival Blake's unexpected run of 19.26 seconds in the 200\u00a0m at the same meeting, which brought him within seven hundredths of Bolt's world record.[175] Although Bolt failed to win the Diamond Race in a specific event, he was not beaten on the 2011 IAAF Diamond League circuit, taking three wins in each of his specialities that year.[168][168][176]\nBolt began the 2012 season with a leading 100\u00a0m time of 9.82 seconds in May.[177] He defeated Asafa Powell with runs of 9.76 seconds in Rome and 9.79 in Oslo.[178] At the Jamaican Athletics Championships, he lost to Yohan Blake, first in the 200\u00a0m and then in the 100\u00a0m, with his younger rival setting leading times for the year.[179][180]\nHowever, at the 2012 London Olympics, he won the 100 metres gold medal with a time of 9.63 seconds, improving upon his own Olympic record and duplicating his gold medal from the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Blake was the silver medallist with a time of 9.75 seconds.[181][182] Following the race, seventh-place finisher Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago declared \"There's no doubt he's the greatest sprinter of all time\", while USA Today referred to Bolt as a Jamaican \"national hero\", noting that his victory came just hours before Jamaica was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its independence from the United Kingdom.[183] With his 2012 win, Bolt became the first man to successfully defend an Olympic sprint title since Carl Lewis in 1988.[184]\nI'm now a legend. I'm also the greatest athlete to live.\nBolt followed this up with a successful defence of his Olympic 200 metres title with a time of 19.32 seconds, followed by Blake at 19.44 and Warren Weir at 19.84 to complete a Jamaican podium sweep. With this, Bolt became the first man in history to defend both the 100 m and 200 m Olympic sprint titles.[186][187] He was dramatic in victory: in the final metres of the 200 m race, Bolt placed his fingers on his lips, gesturing to silence his critics, and after crossing the line he completed five push-ups \u2013 one for each of his Olympic gold medals.[185][188][189]\nOn the final day of the 2012 Olympic athletics, Bolt participated in Jamaica's gold medal-winning 4\u00d7100 metres relay team along with Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Blake. With a time of 36.84 seconds, they knocked two tenths of a second from their previous world record from 2011.[190] He celebrated by imitating the \"Mobot\" celebration of Mo Farah, who had claimed a long-distance track double for the host nation.[191]\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge initially stated that Bolt was not yet a \"legend\" and would not deserve such acclaim until the end of his career,[192] but later called him the best sprinter of all time.[193] Following the Olympics he was confirmed as the highest earning track and field athlete in history.[194]\nBolt ended his season with wins on the 2012 IAAF Diamond League circuit; he had 200\u00a0m wins of 19.58 and 19.66 in Lausanne and Z\u00fcrich before closing with a 100\u00a0m of 9.86 in Brussels.[195][196] The latter run brought him his first Diamond League title in the 100\u00a0m.[197]\nBolt failed to record below 10 seconds early season and had his first major 100\u00a0m race of 2013 at the Golden Gala in June. He was served an unexpected defeat by Justin Gatlin, with the American winning 9.94 to Bolt's 9.95. Bolt denied the loss was due to a hamstring issue he had early that year and Gatlin responded: \"I don't know how many people have beaten Bolt but it's an honour\".[198][199] With Yohan Blake injured, Bolt won the Jamaican 100\u00a0m title ahead of Kemar Bailey-Cole and skipped the 200\u00a0m, which was won by Warren Weir.[200][201] Prior to the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, Bolt set world leading times in the sprints, with 9.85 for the 100\u00a0m at the London Anniversary Games and 19.73 for the 200\u00a0m in Paris.[202][203]\nBolt regained the title as world's fastest man by winning the World Championships 100 metres in Moscow. In wet conditions, he edged Gatlin by eight hundredths of a second with 9.77, which was the fastest run that year.[204][205] Gatlin was the sole non-Jamaican in the top five, with Nesta Carter, Nickel Ashmeade and Bailey-Cole finishing next.[206]\nBolt was less challenged in the 200\u00a0m final. His closest rival was Jamaican champion Warren Weir but Bolt ran a time of 19.66 to finish over a tenth of a second clear.[207] This performance made Bolt the first man in the history of the 200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics to win three gold medals over the distance.[208]\nBolt won a third consecutive world relay gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay final, which made him the most successful athlete in the 30-year history of the world championships.[209] The Jamaican team, featuring four of the top five from the 100\u00a0m final were comfortable winners with Bolt reaching the finish line on his anchor leg three tenths of a second ahead of the American team anchored by Gatlin.[210] Bolt's performances were matched on the women's side by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, meaning Jamaica took a complete sweep of the sprint medals at the 2013 World Championships.[209]\nAfter the championships, Bolt took 100\u00a0m wins on the 2013 IAAF Diamond League circuit in Z\u00fcrich and Brussels. He remained unbeaten in the 200\u00a0m and his only loss that year was to Gatlin over 100\u00a0m in Rome.[211] For the fifth time in six years, Bolt was named IAAF World Male Athlete of the Year.[212]\nAn injury to Bolt's hamstring in March 2014 caused him to miss nine weeks of training. Having recovered from surgery, Bolt competed in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Not in peak form Bolt said that he was attending the Games for the fans and to show his progress since the injury.[213] Bolt and his teammates won the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay in 37.58 seconds \u2013 a Commonwealth Games record.[214] This was the foremost competition of the year for Bolt, given no Olympics or World Championships in 2014.\nIn August 2014, Bolt set the indoor 100\u00a0m world record in Warsaw with a time of 9.98 seconds.[215] This was his sole individual outing of the 2014 season.[216] Soon afterwards he ended his season early in order to be fit for the 2015 season.[217] In Bolt's absence, Justin Gatlin had dominated the sprints, holding the year's fastest times, including seven of the top ten 100\u00a0m runs that season.[216][218]\nAt the start of 2015, he intended to make the 2017 World Championships in Athletics his last major competition before retirement.[219]\nUpon his return from injury, Bolt appeared a reduced figure at the start of the 2015 season. He ran only two 100\u00a0m and three 200\u00a0m before the major championship. He opened with 10.12 seconds for the 100\u00a0m and 20.20 for the 200\u00a0m. He won the 200\u00a0m in New York and Ostrava, but his season's best time of 20.13 seconds ranked him 20th in the world going into the championships.[220] Two 100\u00a0m runs of 9.87 in July in London showed better form, but in comparison, Justin Gatlin was easily the top ranked sprinter \u2013 the American had times of 9.74 and 19.57 seconds, and had already run under 9.8 seconds on four occasions that season.[220][221] Bolt entered the World Championships to defend his sprint titles but was not the comfortable favourite he had been since 2008.[222][223]\nIn the World Championships 100\u00a0m, Bolt won his semi-final in 9.96, which lagged Gatlin's semi-final win in 9.77 seconds.[221] However, Gatlin did not match that form in the final while Bolt improved through the rounds. In a narrow victory, Bolt leaned at the line to beat Gatlin 9.79 to 9.80 seconds. Bolt joined Carl Lewis and Maurice Greene on a record three 100\u00a0m world titles.[224][225][226]\nA similar outcome followed in the 200\u00a0m World finals. In the semi-final, Gatlin outpaced Bolt \u2013 the Jamaican at 19.95 and the American at 19.87. Despite such slow times prior to Beijing, Bolt delivered in the final with his fifth fastest run ever for the 200\u00a0m at 19.55 seconds. Gatlin failed to reach his early season form and finished almost two-tenths of a second behind Bolt. Bolt's four consecutive wins over 200\u00a0m at the World Championships was unprecedented and established him clearly as the best ever sprinter at the competition.[227]\nThere was also a fourth straight win in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay with the Jamaica team (Nesta Carter, Asafa Powell, Nickel Ashmeade, Usain Bolt). The Americans initially had a lead, but a poor baton exchange saw them disqualified and Jamaica defend their title in 37.36 seconds \u2013 well clear of the Chinese team who took a surprise silver for the host nation.[228]\nConscious of his injuries at the start of the season, he did not compete after the World Championships, skipping the 2015 IAAF Diamond League final.[229]\nBolt competed sparingly in the 200\u00a0m before the Olympics, with a run of 19.89 seconds to win at the London Grand Prix being his sole run of note over that distance. He had four races over 100\u00a0m, though only one was in Europe, and his best of 9.88 seconds in Kingston placed him fourth on the world seasonal rankings. As in the previous season, Gatlin appeared to be in better form, having seasonal bests of 9.80 and 19.75 seconds to rank first and second in the sprints.[230][231] Doping in athletics was a prime topic before the 2016 Rio Olympics, given the banning of the Russian track and field team for state doping, and Bolt commented that he had no problem with doping controls: \"I have no issue with being drug-tested...I remember in Beijing every other day they were drug-testing us\". He also highlighted his dislike of rival Tyson Gay's reduced ban for cooperation, given their close rivalry since the start of Bolt's career, saying \"it really bothered me \u2013 really, really bothered me\".[232]\nI want to be among greats Muhammad Ali and Pel\u00e9.\nAt the 2016 Rio Olympics, Bolt won the 100 metres gold medal with a time of 9.81 seconds.[234] With this win, Bolt became the first athlete to win the event three times at the Olympic Games.[234] Bolt followed up his 100 m win with a gold medal in the 200 m, which also makes him the first athlete to win the 200 m three times at the Olympic Games.[235] Bolt ran the anchor leg for the finals of the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay and secured his third consecutive and last Olympic gold medal in the event.[236] With that win, Bolt obtained the \"triple-triple\", three sprinting gold medals in three consecutive Olympics, and finished his Olympic career with a 100% win record in finals.[236] However, in January 2017, Bolt was stripped of the 4 \u00d7 100 relay gold from the Beijing Games in 2008 because his teammate Nesta Carter was found guilty of a doping violation.[237]\nBolt took a financial stake in a new Australia-based track and field meeting series \u2013 Nitro Athletics. He performed at the inaugural meet in February 2017 and led his team (Bolt All-Stars) to victory. The competition featured variations on traditional track and field events. He committed himself to three further editions.[238][239]\nIn 2017, the Jamaican team was stripped of the 2008 Olympics 4\u00d7100 metre title due to Nesta Carter's disqualification for doping offences. Bolt, who never failed a dope test, was quoted by the BBC saying that the prospect of having to return the gold was \"heartbreaking.\"[240] The banned substance in Carter's test was identified as methylhexanamine, a nasal decongestant sometimes used in dietary supplements.\nAt the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt won his heat uncomfortably after a slow start in 10.07, in his semi-final he improved to 9.98 but was beaten by Christian Coleman by 0.01. That race broke Bolt's 4 year winning streak in the 100\u00a0m. In his final individual race, in the final, Bolt won the Bronze medal in 9.95, 0.01 behind Silver medalist Coleman and 0.03 behind World Champion Justin Gatlin. It was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championship since the 4\u00d7100 m relay of the 2007 World Athletics Championships. Also at the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt participated as the anchor runner for Jamaica's 4\u00d7100-metre relay team in both the heats and the final. Jamaica won their heat comfortably in 37.95 seconds. In what was intended to be his final race, Bolt pulled up in agony with 50 metres to go and collapsed to the track after what was later confirmed to be another hamstring injury. He refused a wheelchair and crossed the finish line one last time with the assistance of his teammates Omar McLeod, Julian Forte, and Yohan Blake.[241]\nIn an interview with Decca Aitkenhead of The Guardian in November 2016, Bolt said he wished to play as a professional footballer after retiring from track and field. He reiterated his desire to play for Manchester United if given a chance and added, \"For me, if I could get to play for Manchester United, that would be like a dream come true. Yes, that would be epic.\"[242]\nIn 2018, after training with Norwegian side Str\u00f8msgodset,[243] Bolt played for the club as a forward in a friendly match against the Norway national under-19 team. He wore the number \"9.58\" in allusion to his 100 m world record.[244] Bolt wore the same number whilst captaining the World XI during Soccer Aid 2018 at Old Trafford.[245]\nOn 21 August 2018, on his 32nd birthday, Bolt started training with Australian club Central Coast Mariners of the A-League.[246] He made his friendly debut for the club as a substitute on 31 August 2018 against a Central Coast Select team, made up of players playing in the local area.[247] On 12 October, he started in a friendly against amateur club Macarthur South West United and scored two goals, both in the second half, with his goal celebration featuring his signature \u201cTo Di World\u201d pose.[248][249]\nBolt was offered a two-year contract from Maltese club Valletta, which he turned down on 18 October 2018.[250] On 21 October 2018, Bolt was offered a contract by the Mariners.[251] The Australian FA was helping the Mariners to fund it.[252] Later that month, Perth Glory forward Andy Keogh was critical of Bolt's ability, stating his first touch is \"like a trampoline.\" He added Bolt has \"shown a bit of potential but it's a little bit of a kick in the teeth to the professionals that are in the league.\"[253]\nBolt left the Mariners in early November 2018 after 8 weeks with the club.[254] In January 2019, Bolt decided not to pursue a career in football, saying his \"sports life is over.\"[255]\nBolt expresses a love for dancing and his character is frequently described as laid-back and relaxed.[25][256] His Jamaican track and field idols include Herb McKenley and former Jamaican 100\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m world record holder, Don Quarrie. Michael Johnson, the former 200 m world and Olympic record holder, is also held in high esteem by Bolt.[25]\nBolt has the nickname \"Lightning Bolt\" due to his name and speed.[1] He is Catholic and known for making the sign of the cross before racing competitively, and he wears a Miraculous Medal during his races. His middle name is St. Leo.[257]\nIn 2010, Bolt also revealed his fondness of music, when he played a reggae DJ set to a crowd in Paris.[258] He is also an avid fan of the Call of Duty video game series, saying, \"I stay up late [playing the game online], I can't help it.\"[259]\nIn his autobiography, Bolt reveals that he has suffered from scoliosis, a condition that has curved his spine to the right and has made his right leg half an inch shorter than his left.[260]  A result of this is that his left leg remains on the ground 14 percent longer than his right leg, with left leg striking with 955 lbs of force and right with 1080 lbs. Biomechanics researchers have studied, with no firm conclusions, whether this asymmetry has helped or hurt Bolt in his sprinting career.[261]\nHe popularised the \"lightning bolt\" pose, also known as \"to di world\" or \"bolting\", which he used both before races and in celebration. The pose consists of extending a slightly raised left arm to the side and the right arm folded across the chest, with both hands have the thumb and index finger outstretched. His performance of the pose during his Olympic and World Championship victories led to widespread copying of the move, from American President Barack Obama to small children. It has been suggested that the pose comes from Jamaican dancehall moves of the period,[262][263] though Olympic sprint champion Bernard Williams also had performed similar celebration moves earlier that decade.[264]\nCricket was the first sport to interest Bolt, and he said if he were not a sprinter, he would be a fast bowler instead.[25] As a child, he was a supporter of the Pakistani cricket team and admired the bowling of Waqar Younis.[265] He is also a fan of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar, West Indian opener Chris Gayle,[266] and Australian opener Matthew Hayden.[267] During a charity cricket match, Bolt clean-bowled Gayle who was complimentary of Bolt's pace and swing.[268] Bolt also struck a six off Gayle's bowling. Another bowler complimentary of Bolt's pace was former West Indies fast-bowling great Curtly Ambrose.[269]\nAfter talking with Australian cricketer Shane Warne, Bolt suggested that if he were able to get time off he would be interested in playing in the cricket Big Bash League. Melbourne Stars chief executive Clint Cooper said there were free spots on his team should be available. Bolt stated that he enjoyed the Twenty20 version of the game, admiring the aggressive and constant nature of the batting. On his own ability, he said \"I don't know how good I am. I will probably have to get a lot of practice in.\"[270][271]\nBolt is also a fan of Premier League football team Manchester United.[272] He has declared he is a fan of Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.[273] Bolt was a special guest of Manchester United at the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final in London, where he stated that he would like to play for them after his retirement.[274]\nIn 2013, Bolt played basketball in the NBA All-Star Weekend Celebrity Game. He scored two points from a slam dunk but acknowledged his other basketball skills were lacking.[275]\nA biographical film based on the athletic life of Bolt to win three Olympic gold medals, titled I Am Bolt, was released on 28 November 2016 in United Kingdom. The film was directed by Benjamin Turner and Gabe Turner.[276][277]\nAfter winning the 200 m title in the 2002 World Junior Championships in Kingston, Bolt signed a sponsorship deal with Puma.[278] To promote Bolt's chase for Olympic glory in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Puma released a series of videos including Bolt's then-world-record-setting run in Icahn Stadium and his Olympic preparations.[279] After his record-breaking run in New York City, which was preceded by a lightning storm,[280] the press frequently made puns on the Jamaican's name, nicknaming him \"Lightning Bolt\" and the \"Bolt from the blue\".[281][282][283] During the 2008 Beijing 100 m final, Bolt wore golden Puma Complete Theseus spikes that had \"Beijing 100 m Gold\" emblazoned across them.[284] Writing of Bolt's performance at the Olympics, The Associated Press said:\nAlmost single-handedly, Bolt has helped track transform itself from a dying sport to one with a singular, smiling, worldwide star.\nIn September 2010, Bolt travelled to Australia where his sponsor Gatorade was holding an event called the \"Gatorade Bolt\" to find Australia's fastest footballer. The event was held at the Sydney International Athletic Centre and featured football players from rugby league, rugby union, Australian rules football, and association football. Prior to the race Bolt gave the runners some private coaching and also participated in the 10th anniversary celebrations for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.[285]\nIn January 2012, Bolt impersonated Richard Branson in an advertising campaign for Virgin Media.[286] The campaign was directed by Seth Gordon and features the Virgin founder Branson to promote its broadband service. In March 2012, Bolt starred in an advert for Visa and the 2012 Summer Olympics.[287] In July 2012, Bolt and RockLive launched Bolt!, an Apple iOS game based on his exploits. Bolt! quickly became the No. 1 app in Jamaica and climbed the UK iTunes charts to reach No. 2 on the list of Top Free Apps.[288]\nBolt's autobiography, My Story: 9.58: Being the World's Fastest Man, was released in 2010. Bolt had previously said that the book \"...should be exciting, it's my life, and I'm a cool and exciting guy.\"[272] His athletics agent is PACE Sports Management.[289]\nAs part of his sponsorship deal with Puma, the manufacturer sends sporting equipment to his alma mater, William Knibb Memorial High School, every year. At Bolt's insistence, advertisements featuring him are filmed in Jamaica, by a Jamaican production crew, in an attempt to boost local enterprise and gain exposure for the country.[290] In 2017, Bolt had the third highest earning social media income for sponsors among sportspeople (behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar), and he was the only non-footballer in the top seven.[291]\nUsain Bolt co-founded electric scooter company Bolt Mobility in 2018, created in his namesake.[292] Bolt founded the micromobility company, which provides electric scooters and other yet-to-be released mobility devices, such as the company's upcoming Bolt Nano. Bolt appeared in Bolt Mobility's debut commercial, released through YouTube and his official Facebook account.[293] Bolt appeared in a number of interviews for the company, alongside CEO Sarah Pishevar Haynes. Bolt made his first public appearance for the company in March 2019, during the company's New York City launch and in CNBC interviews on the NYSE.[294] \nIn May 2019, the company expanded its services to Europe, introducing the product first in Paris.[295]\n\nIn May 2019, Bolt spoke in Paris at the Viva Technology conference, where he introduced the company's future release of the Nano minicar.[296] He also met with French president Emmanuel Macron while at the conference. While in France, Bolt participated in a CNN interview where he revealed his reasons for founding the company.[297] Usain Bolt, CNN Interview\n Bolt argues that his scooter is different, which allows bag, shopping and mobile phone storage. The scooters have capabilities to reach up to 30 MPH, but are typically capped at 15 MPH depending on city regulation. The company has begun operations in a number of U.S. cities, and plans to expand throughout Europe and Asia.\nIn July 2019, Bolt made his debut as a dancehall music producer with the release of the Olympe Ros\u00e9 riddim that featured 5 tracks from Jamaican dancehall artistes: Dexta Daps \"Big Moves\", Munga Honorable \"Weekend\", Christopher Martin \"Dweet\", Ding Dong \"Top A Di Top\" and football player tuned artist Ricardo \"Bibi\" Gardner \"Mount A Gyal\".[298]\nIn November 2019, he followed up with another compilation called the 'Immortal Riddim' that included tracks from Vybz Kartel, Masicka, Munga Honorable and Christopher Martin.[299][300]\nBolt made a cameo appearance in the opening sketch of 13 October 2012 broadcast of Saturday Night Live, hosted by Christina Applegate. The segment was a parody of the Vice Presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. In the sketch, Taran Killam mimicking Ryan had just lied about running a 2:50 marathon, a sub-4-minute mile on no training and winning the 100 metres in London when Bolt was introduced as his partner to confirm.\nWhen Ryan asked Bolt \"Who won the 100 metres?\" the Jamaican gold-medallist answered simply. \"I did.\" Ryan followed up by asking Bolt about his (Ryan's) finish. \"You didn't finish. You weren't even there.\"[312][313]\nOn 23 November 2016, Bolt competed against James Corden in a rap battle on the \"Drop the Mic\" segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden, which he won.\nBolt's personal best of 9.58 seconds in 2009 in the 100 metres is the fastest ever run.[314] Bolt also holds the second fastest time of 9.63 seconds,[88] the current Olympic record,[90] and set two previous world records in the event. Bolt's personal best of 19.19 s in the 200 metres is the world record. This was recorded at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin against a headwind of \u22120.3\u00a0m/s. This performance broke his previous world record in the event, his 19.30 s clocking in winning the 2008 Olympic 200 metres title.\nBolt has been on three world-record-setting Jamaican relay teams. The first record, 37.10 seconds, was set in winning gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics, although the result was voided in 2017 when the team was disqualified. The second record came at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, a time of 37.04 seconds. The third world record was set at the 2012 Summer Olympics, a time of 36.84 seconds.[315]\nBolt also holds the 200 metres world teenage best results for the age categories 15 (20.58 s), 16 (20.13 s, world youth record), 17 (19.93 s) and 18 (19.93 s, world junior record).[88] He also holds the 150 metres world best set in 2009, during which he ran the last 100 metres in 8.70 seconds, the quickest timed 100 metres ever.[88]\nBolt completed a total of 53 wind-legal sub-10-second performances in the 100\u00a0m during his career, with his first coming on 3 May 2008 and his last on 5 August 2017 at the World Championships. His longest undefeated streak in the 200\u00a0m was in 17 finals, lasting from 12 June 2008 to 3 September 2011. He also had a win-streak covering 14 100\u00a0m finals from 16 August 2008 to 16 July 2010.[316]\nBolt claimed 19 Guinness World Records, and, after Michael Phelps, holds second highest number of accumulative Guinness World Records for total number of accomplishments and victories in the sport.[317]\nFrom his record time of 9.58 s for the 100 m sprint, Usain Bolt's average ground speed equates to 37.58\u00a0km/h (23.35\u00a0mph). However, once his reaction time of 0.148 s is subtracted, his time is 9.44 s, making his average speed 38.18\u00a0km/h (23.72\u00a0mph).[143] Bolt's top speed, based on his split time of 1.61 s for the 20 metres from the 60- to 80-metre marks (made during the 9.58 WR at 100m), is 12.42\u00a0m/s (44.72\u00a0km/h (27.79\u00a0mph)).[318]\nWorld rank in parentheses\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nWentworth Earl Miller III (born 2 June 1972)[1] is a British-American actor and screenwriter. He rose to prominence following his starring role as Michael J. Scofield in the Fox series Prison Break, for which he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama in 2005. He made his screenwriting debut with the 2013 thriller film Stoker. In 2014, he began playing Leonard Snart / Captain Cold in a recurring role on The CW series The Flash before becoming a series regular on the spin-off, Legends of Tomorrow. Miller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, to American parents.[2] His mother, Roxann (n\u00e9e Palm), is a special education teacher, and his father, Wentworth E. Miller II, is a lawyer and teacher, who was studying at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship at the time of Miller's birth.[1][3][4] Miller said in 2003 that his father is black and his mother is white.[5] His father is of African-American, Jamaican, German, and English ancestry; his mother is of Russian, Swedish, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.[6][7] Miller's family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, when he was a year old.[4][8] He attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn, and graduated from Princeton University in 1995 with a bachelor's degree in English literature.[9] While at Princeton, he performed with the a cappella group the Princeton Tigertones and was a member of the Quadrangle Club and the Colonial Club.[10] In 1995, Miller relocated to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.[11] He has stated that his rocky road to stardom \"was a long time in the coming and there were a lot of upsets and a lot of failures and roadblocks, but I couldn't walk away from it. I needed it like I needed air, it was just something I had to do.\"[12] Miller's first TV appearance was as student-turned-sea monster Gage Petronzi on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (\"Go Fish\", 1998). Miller's first starring role was in 2002 as the sensitive, introverted David Scott in ABC's mini-series Dinotopia. After appearing in a few minor television roles, he moved on to co-star in the 2003 film The Human Stain, playing the younger version of the Anthony Hopkins character, Coleman Silk. He identified strongly with the core dilemma of the movie, about a black man who chooses to \"pass\" as white. Miller worked extensively on the role, not only in researching Anthony Hopkins, but by embarking on a four-month regimen to accurately portray Silk as a boxer. Also in 2003, he had a minor role in the film Underworld, playing a doctor and friend of the character Michael Corvin. In 2005, Miller was cast as Michael Scofield in Fox Network's television drama Prison Break. He played the role of a caring brother who created an elaborate scheme to help his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) escape death row after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. His character had a full upper body (front and back) tattoo. Covering both the front of Miller's torso and his back, along with both arms from shoulders to wrists, the special effects for the tattoo took over four hours to apply. His performance in the show earned him a 2005 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series.[13] The show was finished in 2009 after four seasons, but a new nine-episode fifth season was released April 4, 2017, with Miller reprising his role. Miller appeared in two Mariah Carey music videos, \"It's Like That\" as a party guest and \"We Belong Together\" as her love interest. Director Brett Ratner, who directed the pilot episode of Prison Break, was also signed on to direct the two Carey videos. Ratner decided to use Miller in the videos as well.[14] In addition, Miller guest-starred in the Season 11 premiere of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Detective Nate Kendall, a detective from Precinct 24 of the New York City Police Department.[15][16] He also featured in Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth film in the commercially successful Resident Evil film series based on the video game series of the same name; Miller plays Chris Redfield, one of the protagonists of the video game series. Miller wrote the screenplay for the film Stoker, as well as a prequel to Stoker, Uncle Charlie.[17] He used the pseudonym Ted Foulke, later explaining, \"I just wanted the scripts to sink or swim on their own.\"[18] Miller's script was voted to the 2010 \"Black List\" of the 10 best unproduced screenplays then making the rounds in Hollywood.[19] The film is about a teenage girl who must deal with a mysterious uncle following the death of her father. Miller described it as a \"horror film, a family drama and a psychological thriller\".[20] Although influenced by Bram Stoker's Dracula, Miller has clarified that Stoker is not a vampire story.[20][21] Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt also influenced the film but only as a jumping-off point, from which the story takes a different direction.[20] Park Chan-wook directed, with stars Mia Wasikowska as the teenager, Nicole Kidman as the mother, and Matthew Goode as the uncle.[22] The film was released in 2013, and received generally positive reviews from critics.[23] In July 2014, it was announced that Miller had joined the cast of The CW superhero series The Flash in a recurring role as Leonard Snart / Captain Cold.[24] He made his first appearance in the fourth episode of the first season, and reprised his role on Legends of Tomorrow.[25] These shows reunited him with his Prison Break co-star Dominic Purcell, who portrayed Mick Rory / Heat Wave. Miller exited Legends of Tomorrow as a series regular at the end of season one, but signed a contract with Warner Bros. TV to continue portraying Snart simultaneously on multiple shows in the Arrowverse.[26] Miller wrote the screenplay for the 2016 horror film The Disappointments Room, produced by Voltage Pictures and Killer Films.[27] The film received negative reviews from critics.[28] He is reportedly in negotiations to write the screenplay adaptation of the novel The Story of Edgar Sawtelle by David Wroblewski which is set to be produced by Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks among others.[29] Miller lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has two sisters, Leigh and Gillian. He holds dual British and US citizenship by virtue of his birth in the United Kingdom to American parents.[21] In 2007, Miller denied to InStyle magazine that he was gay.[30] However, he came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website declining an invitation to attend the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival because he felt \"deeply troubled\" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens (referring to the Russian LGBT propaganda law, enacted the previous June, which banned \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\").[31][32] Miller wrote that he \"cannot in good conscience participate in a celebratory occasion hosted by a country where people like myself are being systematically denied their basic right to live and love openly\".[31] At the 2013 Human Rights Campaign Dinner in Seattle, Washington, Miller said he had attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager before coming out as gay.[33] He said: \"When someone asked me if that was a cry for help, I said no, because I told no one. You only cry for help if you believe there's help to cry for.\"[33] He discussed struggling in Hollywood as a closeted actor, and talked about how his involvement in the ManKind Project helped him learn about brotherhood, sisterhood, and being part of a community.[34] In a 2016 Facebook post, he revealed that he \"[had] struggled with depression since childhood. It's a battle that's cost [him] time, opportunities, relationships, and a thousand sleepless nights.\" He made this emotional post in reaction to a meme of himself which poked fun at his weight gain in 2010. Miller said that his weight gain was due to him finding comfort in food as he was suicidal.[35] Near the end of the post he provided links for organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Active Minds.[36] On October 17, 2016, Active Minds, a mental health charity, announced that Miller will be an ambassador for the organization.[37]",

He rose to prominence following his starring role as Michael J. Scofield in the Fox series Prison Break, for which he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama in 2005. He made his screenwriting debut with the 2013 thriller film Stoker. In 2014, he began playing Leonard Snart / Captain Cold in a recurring role on The CW series The Flash before becoming a series regular on the spin-off, Legends of Tomorrow.\nMiller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, to American parents.[2] His mother, Roxann (n\u00e9e Palm), is a special education teacher, and his father, Wentworth E. Miller II, is a lawyer and teacher, who was studying at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship at the time of Miller's birth.[1][3][4] Miller said in 2003 that his father is black and his mother is white.[5] His father is of African-American, Jamaican, German, and English ancestry; his mother is of Russian, Swedish, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.[6][7]\nMiller's family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, when he was a year old.[4][8]  He attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn, and graduated from Princeton University in 1995 with a bachelor's degree in English literature.[9] While at Princeton, he performed with the a cappella group the Princeton Tigertones and was a member of the Quadrangle Club and the Colonial Club.[10]\nIn 1995, Miller relocated to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.[11] He has stated that his rocky road to stardom \"was a long time in the coming and there were a lot of upsets and a lot of failures and roadblocks, but I couldn't walk away from it. I needed it like I needed air, it was just something I had to do.\"[12] Miller's first TV appearance was as student-turned-sea monster Gage Petronzi on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (\"Go Fish\", 1998).\nMiller's first starring role was in 2002 as the sensitive, introverted David Scott in ABC's mini-series Dinotopia. After appearing in a few minor television roles, he moved on to co-star in the 2003 film The Human Stain, playing the younger version of the Anthony Hopkins character, Coleman Silk. He identified strongly with the core dilemma of the movie, about a black man who chooses to \"pass\" as white. Miller worked extensively on the role, not only in researching Anthony Hopkins, but by embarking on a four-month regimen to accurately portray Silk as a boxer. Also in 2003, he had a minor role in the film Underworld, playing a doctor and friend of the character Michael Corvin.\nIn 2005, Miller was cast as Michael Scofield in Fox Network's television drama Prison Break. He played the role of a caring brother who created an elaborate scheme to help his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) escape death row after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. His character had a full upper body (front and back) tattoo. Covering both the front of Miller's torso and his back, along with both arms from shoulders to wrists, the special effects for the tattoo took over four hours to apply. His performance in the show earned him a 2005 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series.[13] The show was finished in 2009 after four seasons, but a new nine-episode fifth season was released April 4, 2017, with Miller reprising his role.\nMiller appeared in two Mariah Carey music videos, \"It's Like That\" as a party guest and \"We Belong Together\" as her love interest. Director Brett Ratner, who directed the pilot episode of Prison Break, was also signed on to direct the two Carey videos. Ratner decided to use Miller in the videos as well.[14]\nIn addition, Miller guest-starred in the Season 11 premiere of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit as Detective Nate Kendall, a detective from Precinct 24 of the New York City Police Department.[15][16] He also featured in Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth film in the commercially successful Resident Evil film series based on the video game series of the same name; Miller plays Chris Redfield, one of the protagonists of the video game series.\nMiller wrote the screenplay for the film Stoker, as well as a prequel to Stoker, Uncle Charlie.[17] He used the pseudonym Ted Foulke, later explaining, \"I just wanted the scripts to sink or swim on their own.\"[18] Miller's script was voted to the 2010 \"Black List\" of the 10 best unproduced screenplays then making the rounds in Hollywood.[19] The film is about a teenage girl who must deal with a mysterious uncle following the death of her father. Miller described it as a \"horror film, a family drama and a psychological thriller\".[20] Although influenced by Bram Stoker's Dracula, Miller has clarified that Stoker is not a vampire story.[20][21] Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt also influenced the film but only as a jumping-off point, from which the story takes a different direction.[20] Park Chan-wook directed, with stars Mia Wasikowska as the teenager, Nicole Kidman as the mother, and Matthew Goode as the uncle.[22] The film was released in 2013, and received generally positive reviews from critics.[23]\nIn July 2014, it was announced that Miller had joined the cast of The CW superhero series The Flash in a recurring role as Leonard Snart / Captain Cold.[24] He made his first appearance in the fourth episode of the first season, and reprised his role on Legends of Tomorrow.[25] These shows reunited him with his Prison Break co-star Dominic Purcell, who portrayed Mick Rory / Heat Wave. Miller exited Legends of Tomorrow as a series regular at the end of season one, but signed a contract with Warner Bros. TV to continue portraying Snart simultaneously on multiple shows in the Arrowverse.[26]\nMiller wrote the screenplay for the 2016 horror film The Disappointments Room, produced by Voltage Pictures and Killer Films.[27] The film received negative reviews from critics.[28] He is reportedly in negotiations to write the screenplay adaptation of the novel The Story of Edgar Sawtelle by David Wroblewski which is set to be produced by Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks among others.[29]\nMiller lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has two sisters, Leigh and Gillian. He holds dual British and US citizenship by virtue of his birth in the United Kingdom to American parents.[21]\nIn 2007, Miller denied to InStyle magazine that he was gay.[30] However, he came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website declining an invitation to attend the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival because he felt \"deeply troubled\" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens (referring to the Russian LGBT propaganda law, enacted the previous June, which banned \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\").[31][32] Miller wrote that he \"cannot in good conscience participate in a celebratory occasion hosted by a country where people like myself are being systematically denied their basic right to live and love openly\".[31]\nAt the 2013 Human Rights Campaign Dinner in Seattle, Washington, Miller said he had attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager before coming out as gay.[33] He said: \"When someone asked me if that was a cry for help, I said no, because I told no one. You only cry for help if you believe there's help to cry for.\"[33] He discussed struggling in Hollywood as a closeted actor, and talked about how his involvement in the ManKind Project helped him learn about brotherhood, sisterhood, and being part of a community.[34]\nIn a 2016 Facebook post, he revealed that he \"[had] struggled with depression since childhood. It's a battle that's cost [him] time, opportunities, relationships, and a thousand sleepless nights.\" He made this emotional post in reaction to a meme of himself which poked fun at his weight gain in 2010. Miller said that his weight gain was due to him finding comfort in food as he was suicidal.[35] Near the end of the post he provided links for organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Active Minds.[36]\nOn October 17, 2016, Active Minds, a mental health charity, announced that Miller will be an ambassador for the organization.[37]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III; August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Prior to his presidency, he served as governor of Arkansas (1979\u20131981 and 1983\u20131992) and as attorney general of Arkansas (1977\u20131979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of former Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and is one of only three U.S. presidents to have been impeached.[1] The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice for the purpose of concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern. He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his term in office. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University,[2] University College, Oxford, and Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the Attorney General of Arkansas, serving from 1977 to 1979. He later served as governor of Arkansas. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. W. Bush. At age 46, he became the third-youngest president in history. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. He passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and has continually received high scores in the historical rankings of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. In addition, he secured the release of two American journalists imprisoned by North Korea, visiting the capital Pyongyang in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[3][4] He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley).[5] His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.[6] Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[4] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[4][7][8][9][10] In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[4] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[11] Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15[12] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[4] Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr.; Clinton threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.[4][13] In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[4] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[14] After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".[15] Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[4][13] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[16] With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968. In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[17] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[4] While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[18] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay,[19] a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[20] Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[21] Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[13][22][23] During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[21][24] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things\".[21] He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.[25] While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife,\" and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".[22][26] During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[27] While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969.[4] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[28] He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\".[29] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers\u00a01 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[30] Colonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[32] Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[33][34] Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[35] After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[4][13] In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[4][36] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[37] The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[38] Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[39] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[40] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[41] Bill married Hillary on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[36] After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52\u00a0percent to 48\u00a0percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[42] Clinton was elected.[13] In 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas.[43] Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\".[44][45][46] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31\u00a0percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.[13] Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[47] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system.[48] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[49] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[49][50] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[13] In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session\u2014the longest in Arkansas history.[48] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[13][49] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[42] Also in the 1980s, The Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[51] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[13][52] According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[53][54] During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976).[55] As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.[56] In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities.[57] Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored\u2014but ultimately vetoed\u2014by the First Lady).[58] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[59] and poorly delivered.[60] Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[49][61] During his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[62][63] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[64][65] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[66][67][68] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69\u00a0billion in 1998, $126\u00a0billion in 1999, and $236\u00a0billion in 2000,[69] during the last three years of Clinton's presidency.[70] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[71][72] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[73] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York, in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York. In the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[13] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish.[74] Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[13][61] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[61] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.[13] During the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[4][75] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".[76] Clinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.[53][77] Bush's approval ratings were around 80\u00a0percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[61] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40\u00a0percent.[61][78] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention\u2014with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform\u2014many moderates were alienated.[79] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[80] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[81] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\".[81] Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success.[81] Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[5] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[82][83] Inaugural address, January 20, 1993.[84] Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[85] and was popular with the public.[86] Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993\u2014the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade\u2014Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[87] Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"\u2014a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[88] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[89] On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[90] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[91] Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[92] On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[93] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[94] In August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15\u00a0million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90\u00a0percent of small businesses,[95] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2\u00a0percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.[96] On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[52] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[49][52] In November 1993, David Hale\u2014the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy\u2014alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.[97] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair. On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[52] In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\".[98] That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[99] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban\u00a0... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress\".[100] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[101] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[49] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\".[102] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[103] On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[104] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[104] The Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[105] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\"[106] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period. [107] On October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov.[108][109] The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[110][111] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011\u2014Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"[112] After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[113] The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[114] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files.[115] On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.[116] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\".[117] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\"[118] Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\".[119] Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\".[118] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\"[120] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[121] Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[122] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[123] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[124] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[125] Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[126] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[127] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[123] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[128] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[129] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[130] Bill Clinton's announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[131] The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.[132][133] Despite the evidence,[132][134] the Chinese government denied all accusations.[135] As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[136] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[137][138] Ken Gormley, author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[139] According to officials, the IED was large enough to \"blow up the entire presidential motorcade\".[140] Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[139] This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[140] Once more, the word \"wedding\" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[140] Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[141] Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[142] Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[142] The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.[140] Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[140] In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2\u00a0percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7\u00a0percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4\u00a0percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once.[143] The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70\u00a0percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes. In the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy\u2014a Democrat\u2014and Orrin Hatch\u2014a Republican\u2014teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[144] In 1999 he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[145] Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998 by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228-206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury[146] and voted 221-212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.[147] Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after Andrew Johnson) to be impeached.[148][149] Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[150] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\",[151] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998. While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.[152] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition. The Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.[153] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly.[154] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[153] and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[155] Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[153] On January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[156][157] Clinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[52][158] Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.[159] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.[160] During his presidency, Clinton and the U.S. military and diplomatic forces were involved in conflicts in several areas of the world. Clinton played a key role in peace talks in Northern Ireland and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. troops were involved in conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and other regions. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets\u2014a spectacle broadcast on television news programs.[161] In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was planned.[162] Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.[163] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\"[164] In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement. In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the UK government. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, the IRA's political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of Belfast and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during the Troubles.[165] Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks, which eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.[166] In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8\u00a0million (equivalent to $214.86\u00a0million in 2019) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[167] Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011).[168] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,[169] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".[170] In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden[171] and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.[172] To stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide)[173][174] of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[175] NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat,[176] though two died in an Apache helicopter crash.[177] Opinions in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[178][179] Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing.[180][181] In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\".[182] In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\".[183] The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.[184] Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the Kosovo war.[185] Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[185][186] In Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world\", and when I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[187] Seeking to weaken Hussein's grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[188][189] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\"[190] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[191][192] Clinton's November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War.[193] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China.[194] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[195] Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.[196] Relations were damaged for a time by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. President Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.[197] The U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000 granted China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status (previously called most favoured nation (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000 by Clinton.[198][199][200] President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China's accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets\u2014with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world\u2014to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\" said Clinton.[201] U.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by almost five million since 2000.[202] Since the entry of China into the WTO in 2001, the decline in manufacturing jobs has accelerated.[203][204] After initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days.[52] Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had \"missed the opportunity\" to facilitate a \"just and lasting peace\". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[4][205] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[52] Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[206] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[207] Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84\u00a0percent of his nominees were confirmed.[208] Sonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997, to the Second Circuit. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.[209][210] Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[211] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[212] Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams).[212] Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.[213] Throughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[214] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[215] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[216] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[217] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[217] As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45\u00a0percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55\u00a0percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68\u00a0percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58\u00a0percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\"[217] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22\u00a0percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\".[217] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics\u2014and he's done a heck of a good job.\"[218] In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[219] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[220][221] In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[222] The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[222] A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[223] As the first baby boomer president, Clinton was the first chief executive since Calvin Coolidge who was not alive during World War II.[225] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[226][227] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\".[228] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[229] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[229] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency.[230] Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88\u00a0m), Clinton is tied with five others as the fifth-tallest president in the nation's history.[231][232] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba, especially in the South.[233] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\".[234][235] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[236][237] Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[238] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first Black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\".[239] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure.[239] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large.[240] Clinton, a Baptist,[241] has been open about his faith.[242] Shortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a conservative newspaper owner, began to underwrite investigations into Clinton's past, reportedly with the hope of discovering a scandal which would cost him his presidency.[243] Leading the Arkansas Project, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton's home state of Arkansas who would be able to reveal hidden misconduct of the president.[243] Clinton was a friend of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein.[244] Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.[245][246][247] In 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[248] Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[249] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[250] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[251] Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[252] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[253] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky\u2014a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[254] In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[255] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[256] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[257] Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[258] Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.[259] To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press.[260] Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition.[259] In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.[259] The Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998.[261] In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.[262] During the 2018 Congressional elections, no Democratic candidate for office asked Clinton to campaign with him or her, a change that The New York Times attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.[261] Clinton boarded the Lolita Express, a private plane of registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, at least 26 times.[263][264] Flight records indicate that underage girls and young women, such as Chauntae Davies, who were told to do whatever Epstein asks, were present on the plane the majority of the times Clinton boarded the plane.[265][266][267] Epstein has claimed he co-founded the Clinton Foundation.[268] Clinton has denied knowing anything about the Lolita Express or about Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse, despite it being public record.[269][270] Bill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations,[271] and has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention.[272] In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[273][274] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[275] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[276] The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004.[277] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life, in 2004.[278] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[279] In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[280] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[281] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[282] and traveled to the affected areas.[283] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[284] Based on his philanthropic worldview,[285] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[286] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.[287] Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[288] The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[289] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30\u00a0percent in developing nations.[290] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[291] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10\u00a0million toward her campaign.[292] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[293] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[294] Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[295] Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\".[296] After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[297][298] In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[299] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[299] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[300][301] Since then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages.[302] Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\".[303] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery.[304] Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant.[303] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation.[305][306] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[307] During the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina.[308] In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[309] On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W.

Prior to his presidency, he served as governor of Arkansas (1979\u20131981 and 1983\u20131992) and as attorney general of Arkansas (1977\u20131979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of former Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and is one of only three U.S. presidents to have been impeached.[1] The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice for the purpose of concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern. He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his term in office.\nClinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University,[2] University College, Oxford, and Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the Attorney General of Arkansas, serving from 1977 to 1979. He later served as governor of Arkansas. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. W. Bush. At age 46, he became the third-youngest president in history.\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. He passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\nClinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and has continually received high scores in the historical rankings of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. In addition, he secured the release of two American journalists imprisoned by North Korea, visiting the capital Pyongyang in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.\nClinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[3][4] He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley).[5] His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.[6] Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[4] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[4][7][8][9][10] In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[4] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[11]\nAlthough he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15[12] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[4] Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr.; Clinton threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.[4][13]\n\nIn Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[4] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[14] After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".[15]\nClinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[4][13] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[16]\nWith the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968.\nIn 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[17] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[4] While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[18] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay,[19] a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[20]\nUpon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[21] Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[13][22][23]\nDuring his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[21][24] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things\".[21] He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.[25]\nWhile Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife,\" and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".[22][26]\nDuring the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[27] While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969.[4] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[28]\nHe subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\".[29] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers\u00a01 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[30]\nColonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[32] Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[33][34] Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[35]\nAfter Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[4][13] In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[4][36] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[37] The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[38]\nClinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[39] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[40] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[41]\nBill married Hillary on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[36]\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52\u00a0percent to 48\u00a0percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[42] Clinton was elected.[13]\nIn 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas.[43] Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\".[44][45][46] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31\u00a0percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.[13]\nClinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[47] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system.[48] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[49] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[49][50] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[13]\nIn the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session\u2014the longest in Arkansas history.[48] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[13][49] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[42]\nAlso in the 1980s, The Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[51] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[13][52]\nAccording to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[53][54] During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976).[55] As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.[56]\nIn 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities.[57] Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored\u2014but ultimately vetoed\u2014by the First Lady).[58] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[59] and poorly delivered.[60] Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[49][61]\nDuring his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[62][63] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[64][65] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[66][67][68] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69\u00a0billion in 1998, $126\u00a0billion in 1999, and $236\u00a0billion in 2000,[69] during the last three years of Clinton's presidency.[70] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[71][72] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[73] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York, in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York.\nIn the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[13] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish.[74]\nWinning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[13][61] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[61] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.[13]\nDuring the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[4][75] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".[76]\nClinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.[53][77]\nBush's approval ratings were around 80\u00a0percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[61] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40\u00a0percent.[61][78] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention\u2014with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform\u2014many moderates were alienated.[79] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[80] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[81] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\".[81]\nClinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success.[81] Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[5] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[82][83]\nInaugural address, January 20, 1993.[84]\nClinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[85] and was popular with the public.[86]\nTwo days after taking office, on January 22, 1993\u2014the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade\u2014Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[87] Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"\u2014a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[88] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[89]\nOn February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[90] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[91] Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[92]\nOn May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[93] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[94]\nIn August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15\u00a0million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90\u00a0percent of small businesses,[95] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2\u00a0percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.[96]\nOn September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[52] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[49][52]\nIn November 1993, David Hale\u2014the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy\u2014alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.[97] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.\nOn November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[52]\nIn December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\".[98]\nThat month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[99] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban\u00a0... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress\".[100] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[101] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[49] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\".[102] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[103]\nOn January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[104] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[104]\nThe Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[105] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\"[106] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period. [107]\nOn October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov.[108][109] The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[110][111] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011\u2014Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"[112]\nAfter two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[113]\nThe White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[114] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files.[115]\nOn September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.[116] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\".[117] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\"[118] Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\".[119] Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\".[118] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\"[120] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[121]\nDespite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[122] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[123] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[124] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[125] Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[126] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[127] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[123] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[128] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[129] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[130]\nBill Clinton's announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[131]\nThe 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.[132][133] Despite the evidence,[132][134] the Chinese government denied all accusations.[135]\nAs part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[136] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[137][138]\nKen Gormley, author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[139] According to officials, the IED was large enough to \"blow up the entire presidential motorcade\".[140] Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[139] This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[140] Once more, the word \"wedding\" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[140] Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[141] Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[142] Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[142] The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.[140] Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[140]\nIn the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2\u00a0percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7\u00a0percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4\u00a0percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once.[143] The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70\u00a0percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.\nIn the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy\u2014a Democrat\u2014and Orrin Hatch\u2014a Republican\u2014teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[144] In 1999 he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[145]\nClinton was impeached on December 19, 1998 by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228-206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury[146] and voted 221-212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.[147] Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after Andrew Johnson) to be impeached.[148][149] Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[150] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\",[151] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998.\nWhile the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.[152] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.\nThe Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.[153] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly.[154] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[153] and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[155] Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[153]\nOn January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[156][157]\nClinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[52][158] Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.[159] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.[160]\nDuring his presidency, Clinton and the U.S. military and diplomatic forces were involved in conflicts in several areas of the world. Clinton played a key role in peace talks in Northern Ireland and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. troops were involved in conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and other regions.\nThe Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets\u2014a spectacle broadcast on television news programs.[161] In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.\nIn April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was planned.[162] Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.[163] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\"[164]\nIn 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.\nIn 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the UK government. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, the IRA's political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of Belfast and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during the Troubles.[165] Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks, which eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.[166]\nIn February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8\u00a0million (equivalent to $214.86\u00a0million in 2019) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[167]\nCapturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011).[168] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,[169] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".[170]\nIn response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden[171] and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.[172]\nTo stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide)[173][174] of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[175] NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat,[176] though two died in an Apache helicopter crash.[177] Opinions in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[178][179] Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing.[180][181] In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\".[182] In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\".[183] The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.[184] Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the Kosovo war.[185] Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[185][186]\n\nIn Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world\", and when I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[187]\nSeeking to weaken Hussein's grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[188][189] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\"[190] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[191][192]\nClinton's November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War.[193] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China.[194] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[195] Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.[196]\nRelations were damaged for a time by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. President Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.[197]\nThe U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000 granted China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status (previously called most favoured nation (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000 by Clinton.[198][199][200] President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China's accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets\u2014with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world\u2014to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\" said Clinton.[201]\nU.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by almost five million since 2000.[202] Since the entry of China into the WTO in 2001, the decline in manufacturing jobs has accelerated.[203][204]\nAfter initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days.[52] Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had \"missed the opportunity\" to facilitate a \"just and lasting peace\". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[4][205] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[52]\nClinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[206] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[207]\nAlong with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84\u00a0percent of his nominees were confirmed.[208]\nSonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997, to the Second Circuit. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.[209][210]\nClinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[211] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[212] Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams).[212] Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.[213]\nThroughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[214] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[215] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[216] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[217] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[217]\nAs he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45\u00a0percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55\u00a0percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68\u00a0percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58\u00a0percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\"[217] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22\u00a0percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\".[217] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics\u2014and he's done a heck of a good job.\"[218]\nIn May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[219] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[220][221]\nIn 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[222] The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[222]\nA 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[223]\nAs the first baby boomer president, Clinton was the first chief executive since Calvin Coolidge who was not alive during World War II.[225] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[226][227] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\".[228] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[229] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[229] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency.[230] Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88\u00a0m), Clinton is tied with five others as the fifth-tallest president in the nation's history.[231][232] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba, especially in the South.[233] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\".[234][235] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[236][237]\nClinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[238] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first Black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\".[239] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure.[239] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large.[240] Clinton, a Baptist,[241] has been open about his faith.[242]\nShortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a conservative newspaper owner, began to underwrite investigations into Clinton's past, reportedly with the hope of discovering a scandal which would cost him his presidency.[243] Leading the Arkansas Project, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton's home state of Arkansas who would be able to reveal hidden misconduct of the president.[243] Clinton was a friend of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein.[244]\nSeveral women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.[245][246][247]\nIn 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[248] Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[249] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[250] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[251] Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[252] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[253] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky\u2014a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[254]\nIn 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[255] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[256] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[257] Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[258]\nAlso in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.[259] To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press.[260] Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition.[259] In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.[259]\nThe Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998.[261] In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.[262] During the 2018 Congressional elections, no Democratic candidate for office asked Clinton to campaign with him or her, a change that The New York Times attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.[261]\nClinton boarded the Lolita Express, a private plane of registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, at least 26 times.[263][264] Flight records indicate that underage girls and young women, such as Chauntae Davies, who were told to do whatever Epstein asks, were present on the plane the majority of the times Clinton boarded the plane.[265][266][267] Epstein has claimed he co-founded the Clinton Foundation.[268] Clinton has denied knowing anything about the Lolita Express or about Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse, despite it being public record.[269][270]\nBill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations,[271] and has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention.[272]\nIn 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[273][274] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[275] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[276]\nThe William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004.[277] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life, in 2004.[278] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[279]\nIn the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[280] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[281] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[282] and traveled to the affected areas.[283] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[284]\nBased on his philanthropic worldview,[285] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[286] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.[287] Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[288] The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[289] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30\u00a0percent in developing nations.[290] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[291]\nDuring the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10\u00a0million toward her campaign.[292] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[293] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[294] Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[295] Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\".[296] After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[297][298]\nIn 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[299] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[299] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[300][301]\nSince then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages.[302] Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\".[303] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery.[304] Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant.[303] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation.[305][306] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[307]\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina.[308] In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[309]\nOn September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[310]\nIn September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.[311] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.[312] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.[311][313] After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[314]\nThe Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency, which were paid off four years after he left office.[315] Bill and Hillary Clinton have each received millions of dollars in book authorship fees.[316] In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240\u00a0million in the 15\u00a0years from January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing).[317] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153\u00a0million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[318] In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25\u00a0million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5\u00a0million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period.[319] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5\u00a0million and $25.5\u00a0million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17\u00a0million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[320] Clinton earned more than $104\u00a0million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[321] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100\u00a0million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, The New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns[322] show they made $109\u00a0million in the eight years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92\u00a0million from his speaking and book-writing.[316][323][324][325]\nBill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[318][326][327][328] Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.[329][330] Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education.\" She added, \"Bill has worked really hard\u00a0... we had to pay off all our debts\u00a0... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.\"[324]\nVarious colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees[331][332] and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.[333] He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there.[334][335] Schools have been named for Clinton,[336][337][338] and statues have been built to pay him homage.[339][340] U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[341] Arkansas,[342] Kentucky,[343] and New York.[344] He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001.[345] The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in his honor on December 5, 2001.[346]\nHe has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic,[347] Papua New Guinea,[348] Germany,[349] and Kosovo.[339] The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[350][351][352]\nClinton was selected as Time's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992,[353] and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr.[354] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century.[355] He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[356] a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[357] and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.[358]\nIn 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross \"for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010\". Clinton declared at the ceremony that \"in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise\".[359]\nU.S. President Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[360]\nBill Clinton is one of the narrators on a 2003 recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, on Pentatone, together with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren.\nOrganizations\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRose Arianna McGowan[1] (born September 5, 1973) is an American actress, activist, model and author.[2] After her film debut in a brief role in the comedy Encino Man (1992), McGowan achieved wider recognition for her performance in Gregg Araki's dark comedy The Doom Generation (1995), receiving an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance. She had her breakthrough in the horror film Scream (1996) and subsequently headlined the films Going All the Way (1997), Devil in the Flesh (1998) and Jawbreaker (1999). During the 2000s, McGowan became known to television audiences for her role as Paige Matthews in The WB and The CW, supernatural drama series Charmed (2001\u20132006), and starred in Robert Rodriguez's and Quentin Tarantino's double-feature film Grindhouse (2007). She made her directorial debut with the short film Dawn (2014). A feminist activist, McGowan has released a memoir, Brave, and starred in the four-part documentary series Citizen Rose, both in 2018. She has been on the cover of numerous magazines, including Seventeen, Interview, Maxim, GQ, Entertainment Weekly, and Rolling Stone.[3][4] In 2017, Time recognized McGowan as one of the Silence Breakers, the magazine's Person of the Year, for speaking out about sexual assault and harassment.[4] McGowan was born in Certaldo, Tuscany,[1] to American couple Daniel McGowan, an artist,[1] and Terri, a writer. She also has two half-siblings.[5] Her father ran an Italian chapter of the Children of God, which he and his wife were members of until 1978.[6] McGowan spent her early childhood at the group's communes, often traveling through Europe with her parents.[5] Through her father's art contacts in Italy, she became a child model and appeared in Vogue Bambini and various other Italian magazines. Her parents returned to the United States when she was 10 years old, and settled in Eugene, Oregon.[5][7] McGowan had an untraditional childhood, living as a teenage runaway in Portland, Oregon and associating with a group of drag queens in the city.[5][8] When her parents divorced, she lived with her father in Seattle, Washington, attended Roosevelt High School and Nova Alternative High School, and worked at McDonald's. She took ballet lessons until she was 13. At 15, she officially emancipated herself from her parents[9] and moved to Los Angeles. After making her Hollywood film debut with a brief role in the Pauly Shore comedy Encino Man (1992), McGowan was cast in the leading role in Gregg Araki's dark comedy The Doom Generation (1995), which revolved around a threesome of teens who embark on a sex and violence-filled journey. The film brought her a much wider recognition and the attention of film critics; she received a nomination for Best Debut Performance at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards. McGowan next obtained the role of Tatum Riley in the slasher cult film Scream (1996), as the casting director believed she best embodied the \"spunky\", \"cynical\" but \"innocent\" nature of the ill-fated character.[10] Upon its release, the film became a huge critical and financial success, grossing over $100 million in North America and $173 million worldwide.[11] Amid her growing public profile, she was the cover model for the Henry Mancini tribute album Shots in the Dark, which was released in 1996, and became the face of American clothing company Bebe from 1998 to 1999. In 1997, she appeared in the short film Seed, directed by San Francisco-born filmmaker Karin Thayer, and played opposite Peter O'Toole in the 1998 film adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel Phantoms. McGowan spent the majority of the late 1990s headlining a variety of independent films, including roles in Nowhere (1997), where she reunited with Araki, as well as Southie (1996), Going All the Way (1997), Lewis and Clark and George (1997), and Devil in the Flesh (1998), where she usually played seductive and mysterious characters. She gained much attention for the revealing fishnet outfit she wore to the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.[12][13][14][15] In the dark comedy Jawbreaker (1999), she portrayed Courtney Shayne, a popular yet malevolent high school student who tries to cover up her involvement in a classmate's murder. McGowan based her performance on that of Gene Tierney's sociopathic character in Leave Her to Heaven (1945).[16] To accompany the release of the film, Imperial Teen's music video for the song Yoo Hoo featured McGowan as her character harassing the band members with jawbreakers.[17] Jawbreaker was a critical and commercial failure, but found success through home video release and subsequent television airings; it has developed a cult following.[18] McGowan earned a nomination for Best Villain at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards. In 2001, McGowan obtained the role of Paige Matthews in the popular WB supernatural drama series Charmed, as a replacement for the lead actress Shannen Doherty, who had left the show. In the show, about the trio of witches using their combined powers to protect innocent lives from evil beings, McGowan played the character from season four until its final eighth season. In a review of the fourth season, Leigh H. Edwards of PopMatters added that the addition of Paige was \"contrived and clunky\", but welcomed the idea of McGowan joining the show as a witch \"since she has major goth cred as Marilyn Manson's former flame\".[19] DVD Verdict's Cynthia Boris wrote that McGowan brought \"a youthfulness\" and \"a fresh viewer perspective\" to Charmed, further noting that \"fans have come to enjoy her presence on the show.\"[20] Sara Paige and Rachel Hyland of Geek Speak magazine described Paige as \"snarky, compassionate and whimsical\", and believed that \"McGowan was well-suited for the role.\"[21] At the 2001 Wand Awards, McGowan was nominated for Best New Cast Member and at the 2005 Family Television Awards, she won Favorite Sister, for her performance. McGowan starred alongside Brendan Fraser, Bridget Fonda, and Whoopi Goldberg in the dark fantasy comedy Monkeybone (2001) as a cat girl from a limbo-like carnival landscape where nightmares are entertainment. Budgeted at US$75 million, the film only made US$7.6 million;[22] McGowan felt that film \"would've been incredible (at least the underworld part) if the men at 20th Century Fox (the suits) hadn't fired the director, a true artist, Henry Selick [half] the way through filming\", and called his dismissal a \"profoundly stupid move\".[23] During Charmed, McGowan portrayed actress-singer Ann-Margret in the CBS miniseries Elvis (2005), about the life of Elvis Presley. She also appeared briefly as the roommate of the titular character in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia (2006), a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria and opposite Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank. In 2007, McGowan headlined Grindhouse, a double feature horror film by directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. In Rodriguez's segment, Planet Terror, she starred as a go-go dancer and the leader of a group of rebels attempting to survive an onslaught of zombie-like creatures as they feud with a rogue military unit, while in Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, she played a brief role as a victim of a misogynistic, psychopathic stuntman who targets young women with his \"death proof\" stunt car. While Grindhouse made a lackluster US$25.5 million in its theatrical release,[24] it was the subject of much media coverage and critical acclaim from critics; James Berardinelli found McGowan to be the \"standout here\" and Mick LaSalle considered the film as \"the best showcase of [McGowan] career so far\".[25][26] Her next film release, Fifty Dead Men Walking (2008), revolved around Martin McGartland, a British agent who went undercover into the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). McGowan played a woman in the upper ranks of the organisation who offers herself to McGartland. After the film concluded shooting, McGowan sparked controversy in the United Kingdom, where she stated that she would have joined the IRA had she lived in Belfast during the era and that her \"heart just broke for the cause\".[27] The film found a limited audience in theaters[28] while critical response was positive.[29] Also in 2008, McGowan took on a recurring role as a con artist on the acclaimed drama series Nip/Tuck, and co-hosted the TCM's film-series program The Essentials alongside Robert Osbourne, discussing classic Hollywood film.[30] In 2010, McGowan shot a cameo in the Robert Rodriguez feature Machete, a role ultimately cut, but included on the DVD release, and played a semi-homeless junkie in the fantasy drama Dead Awake. In the 3-D sword and sorcery film Conan the Barbarian (2011), a reimagining of the 1982 film of the same name which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, McGowan starred as an evil half-human/half-witch.[31][32] Roger Ebert described her role as a \"piece of work\", writing: \"She has white pancake makeup, blood red lips, cute little facial tattoos and wickedly sharp metal talons on her fingers\".[33] Filming occurred between March and July 2010 in Bulgaria, and Conan was released on August 19, 2011.[34] Budgeted at US$90 million, the film received negative reviews,[35] and only grossed US$48.8 worldwide.[36] Besides her role in the big-budgeted Conan, McGowan starred in mainly independent productions during the early 2010s, such as the psychological thriller Rosewood Lane (2011) from director Victor Salva, the made-for-television film The Pastor's Wife (2011), alongside Michael Shanks, and a film adaptation of The Tell-Tale Heart, released in 2016. McGowan lent her voice to the video games Darkwatch, playing a femme fatale named Tala, and Terminator Salvation, as a troubled soldier named Angie Salter. She guest-starred in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as a grifter who targets New York sex clubs, and also in two episodes of Once Upon A Time between 2012 and 2014, playing the role of the young Cora Mills. In the third season of Chosen (2014), a television series airing via Crackle, McGowan took on the role of an experienced hunter. She made her directorial debut with a short film called Dawn, which revolved around a teen from a strict family falls under the spell of a gas-station employee. The 17-minute piece premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, to critical acclaim; IndieWire noted: \"This was a real gem of a short film. Dawn's salient literary and cultural references, paired with the film's high production value, gorgeous shots, its slow-burner buildup and gripping conclusion, bring something to the table for everyone, and portends an excellent directorial career for Ms. McGowan\".[37] In September 2015, McGowan released her debut single, titled \"RM486\". The song has strong feminist themes, with its title being a play on the abortion drug RU486 and McGowan's initials.[38] The Sound (2017), an independent Canadian horror film, starred McGowan as a best-selling author and paranormal investigator alongside Christopher Lloyd and Michael Eklund.[39] The Hollywood Reporter wrote of her role: \"Despite her sympathetic situation, [it] isn't a particularly interesting character. A dismissive attitude and superior self-regard don't improve her likability either. McGowan seems comfortable with the role, however [...]\".[40] On January 30, 2018, McGowan released a memoir, Brave, in which she details her childhood and her account of the assault by Harvey Weinstein and its aftermath.[41][42][43] On January 31, 2018, Citizen Rose, a four-part documentary series produced by Bunim/Murray Productions following McGowan and her role in the Me Too movement premiered.[44][45] In August 2018, McGowan was announced to receive the Inspiration Award at the GQ Men Of The Year Awards.[46] McGowan appears in the art film Indecision IV, which combines dance and gender issues. \"Shot in one continuous take, the film [...] was created in May 2018, during a watershed moment in McGowan's life and is a physical expression of her state of mind at that time,\" a press statement stated. The piece was commissioned by UK's Heist Gallery, and is set to have special screenings at the Institute of Light in East London on December 15 and 16, with proceeds going to the charity Refuge.[47] While dating Marilyn Manson, McGowan appeared in a music video for the song \"Coma White\";[48] she performed backing vocals on the song \"Posthuman\".[49] Both of these songs appear on the album Mechanical Animals (1998).[50] McGowan appeared on a Brian Transeau track called \"Superfabulous\", from his album Emotional Technology, which was also featured on the final Charmed soundtrack, The Final Chapter.[51] The song has been featured in several films, including Win a Date with Tad Hamilton![52] and Raising Helen. She wrote and recorded a song titled \"Protection\", which was featured in her film Strange Hearts (2011). McGowan has also appeared in the Imperial Teen music video for \"Yoo Hoo\",[53] which was featured on the Jawbreaker soundtrack, and she recorded the theme song from the film Dead Awake (2010). McGowan has expressed interest in recording an album of her own. During an interview with Living TV, she said, \"I was actually thinking of going back and doing more soulful tunes and older tunes\u00a0... and I would love to, when I have a little bit more time.\" In the Charmed episode \"Sense and Sense Ability\", McGowan performed, in character, a cover of the Peggy Lee classic \"Fever\". She performed three songs from the Planet Terror portion of Grindhouse, released on the film's soundtrack by the Var\u00e8se Sarabande label.[54] The songs are entitled \"You Belong to Me\" (a Dean Martin/Jo Stafford cover), \"Useless Talent #32\", and \"Two Against the World\". She appeared briefly in the music video for the 2014 single \"Break the Rules\" by Charli XCX.[55] McGowan is an activist for LGBT rights[56][57] and campaigned against California's Proposition 8,[57] which sought to ban same-sex marriage in the state in 2008.[56] She is also known as an activist for Boston Terriers. She has two, named Bug and Fester, and has personally donated to various Boston Terrier rescues. McGowan reportedly encouraged friends to donate to Boston Terrier Rescue Net, and according to BTRN: \"Having fallen in love with Bug and Fester, her friends donated generously. It amounted to a considerable contribution, which will go a long way in helping BTRN and the needy volunteers who selflessly give to deserving Bostons.\"[58] McGowan is a registered Republican, though she is a vocal critic of U.S. President Donald Trump.[59] In late 2009, McGowan was among several celebrities who participated in the protest NOH8.[57] In March 2018, McGowan came out as non-binary.[60] As of 2018, McGowan resides in Mayfair, London.[61] In January 2019, McGowan pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour drug charge in Virginia concerning cocaine that was found in a wallet she left behind at Dulles International Airport in 2017. She received a US$2,500 fine and a suspended jail sentence.[62] In the early 1990s, McGowan, then relatively unknown, was involved for two years with a man she refers to as William, who, she claims, kept buying her exercise equipment and fashion magazines in an effort to persuade her to get thinner. She developed an eating disorder in her unsuccessful efforts to get her weight down to 84 pounds (38\u00a0kg) like the women in the magazines. \"I never was able to get below 92 pounds (42\u00a0kg),\" she wrote later. \"I felt like a failure.\"[63] That relationship and the eating disorder ended in early 1993 when McGowan met Brett Cantor, a part-owner of Hollywood's Dragonfly nightclub. She came to believe he was her soul mate;[64] however he was brutally stabbed to death in his house that July, leaving her \"shattered\". The killing remains unsolved, and McGowan continues to support efforts to identify a suspect and close the case.[63] McGowan had a three-and-a-half-year relationship with rock musician Marilyn Manson. After a formal engagement lasting two years, McGowan ended the relationship in 2001 over \"lifestyle differences\".[65] Prior to the release of Grindhouse, there was speculation that McGowan was dating director Robert Rodriguez.[66][67] In May 2007, it was reported that they confirmed their relationship while appearing hand-in-hand at the Cannes Film Festival.[68] On October 12, 2007, it was announced by Zap2it.com that McGowan was engaged to Rodriguez.[69] They reportedly split in October 2009.[70] In July 2013, after one year of dating, McGowan became engaged to artist Davey Detail.[71] They married on October 12, 2013 in Los Angeles.[72] In February 2016, she filed for divorce from Detail, citing irreconcilable differences.[73] The divorce was finalized in November 2016.[74] In September 2008, McGowan caused controversy while promoting her film Fifty Dead Men Walking at a Toronto International Film Festival press conference, when she stated, \"I imagine, had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100% have been in the IRA. My heart just broke for the cause. Violence is not to be played out daily and provide an answer to problems, but I understand it.\" This prompted director Kari Skogland and the film's producers to issue a public apology, stating that McGowan's views did not reflect their own.[75] In an August 2011 interview, McGowan talked about her experience working on the film Rosewood Lane with director Victor Salva, who is a convicted child molester and child pornographer,[76][77] stating, \"I still don't really understand the whole story or history there, and I'd rather not, because it's not really my business. But he's an incredibly sweet and gentle man.\"[76] In May 2014, McGowan held a defiant party in support of the Brunei-owned Beverly Hills Hotel, despite a boycott over Brunei's anti-gay laws, which prescribes death by stoning for same-sex activities.[78] McGowan explained her stance on the issue thus: \"Boycotts only work when they hurt the target's bottom line. We are never going to affect the sultan's bottom line. He's worth $20 billion! This is a vanity project for him. It could sit empty for 100 years and he wouldn't even notice. But meanwhile, we're hurting all the wonderful, struggling people who work in the hotel. I'd like him to see that gays are real people. I think that's the only thing that would change his mind, not a boycott.\"[79] In November 2014, while discussing misogyny and sexism during Bret Easton Ellis' podcast, McGowan criticized the gay community for not doing more to help the cause of women's rights, saying, \"I see now, basically, people who've fought for the right to stand on top of a float wearing an orange speedo and take molly. And, I see no help, and I see no paying it forward, and I have a huge problem with that. There are so many things to help and do, and I see no extending of a hand outside of the gay community to another community. And that's a problem for me.\" Rose McGowan also stated, \"Gays are misogynistic as straight men, if not more so. I have an indictment of the gay community right now. I'm actually really upset with them.\" The characterization of LGBT rights activism being centered on drug use and wearing revealing clothing in public were criticized as homophobic or transphobic.[80][81][82][83][84] She later apologized for generalizing gay men as misogynistic, but defended the rest of her comments.[85] In June 2015, McGowan sparked controversy with a Twitter post making public what was perceived as a sexist casting call for an Adam Sandler film. McGowan later said, \"It was just so dumb. I was offended by the stupidity more than anything. I was offended by the fact that went through so many people's hands and nobody red flagged it. This is normal to so many people. It was probably even a girl that had to type it up. It's institutionally OK.\"[86] This reportedly led to McGowan being fired by her agent. She later clarified that talent agent Sheila Wenzel was not responsible for \"firing\" her after she took a stand against sexism in Hollywood.[87][88] \"I'm interested in making the industry better so that women following in my footsteps know that they don't have to take abuse just because she wants be creative,\" the actress told People magazine.[89] In 2015, McGowan criticized Caitlyn Jenner for stating that \"the hardest part about being a woman is figuring out what to wear\", after Jenner had been named \"Woman of the Year\" by Glamour. McGowan stated, \"We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well f**cking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.\"[81][90] In response to accusations of transphobia, McGowan stated, \"Let me take this moment to point out that I am not, nor will I ever be, transphobic. The idea is laughable. Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism.\"[91] In early January 2020, McGowan sparked controversy by apologizing to Iran for the United States' behavior in a tweet sent out in the hours after a US airstrike in Iraq killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani. She wrote, \"Dear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us. #Soleimani\" [92] When The New York Times revealed in October 2017 that she was part of a settlement involving movie mogul Harvey Weinstein in an alleged sexual harassment case, McGowan declined to comment.[93] \"Women fight on,\" she wrote afterwards. \"And to the men out there, stand up. We need you as allies.\" According to the Times, Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, including McGowan, who reached a $100,000 settlement with Weinstein after an encounter in a hotel room with the executive producer in 1997 during the Sundance Film Festival.[93][94] On October 10, 2017, McGowan stated that Harvey Weinstein had behaved inappropriately with her. She accused actor Ben Affleck of lying after Affleck said in a statement that he was \"angry\" over Weinstein's alleged abuse of women, but did not indicate whether he knew about it.[95] Via Twitter, she also attacked other men in the movie industry, tweeting, \"All of you Hollywood 'A-list' golden boys are LIARS....You all knew.\"[96][97] On October 12, McGowan alleged that Harvey Weinstein had raped her, and that Amazon Studios dropped her project after she complained.[98] On the same day, McGowan said that Twitter suspended her account for 12 hours after she repeatedly tweeted about Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct, including toward her.[99] Twitter explained that McGowan's account had violated its privacy policy because one of her tweets included a private phone number. The New York Times reported, \"Many Twitter users expressed outrage over Ms. McGowan's account being locked.\" After the tweet was removed, her account was unlocked several hours before the 12-hour ban was set to expire.[97] Through his lawyer, David Boies, Weinstein at one point hired the private intelligence agency Black Cube to spy on McGowan and to stop outlets such as The New York Times and The New Yorker from reporting their investigations on Harvey Weinstein. Boies' law firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, had provided The Times with legal counsel over the course of the previous decade, including on one libel case. Upon learning that the firm was working to hinder its reporting on Weinstein while simultaneously representing them in other matters, The Times published a stern rebuke of the firm, calling their actions \"intolerable conduct, a grave betrayal of trust, and a breach of the basic professional standards that all lawyers are required to observe\".[100] On February 7, 2018, Jill Messick, McGowan's manager at the time of the alleged rape in 1997, died by suicide.[101] Messick's family blamed Weinstein, the media, the public, and McGowan for her death.[102]",

She had her breakthrough in the horror film Scream (1996) and subsequently headlined the films Going All the Way (1997), Devil in the Flesh (1998) and Jawbreaker (1999).\nDuring the 2000s, McGowan became known to television audiences for her role as Paige Matthews in The WB and The CW, supernatural drama series Charmed (2001\u20132006), and starred in Robert Rodriguez's and Quentin Tarantino's double-feature film Grindhouse (2007). She made her directorial debut with the short film Dawn (2014).\nA feminist activist, McGowan has released a memoir, Brave, and starred in the four-part documentary series Citizen Rose, both in 2018. She has been on the cover of numerous magazines, including Seventeen, Interview, Maxim, GQ, Entertainment Weekly, and Rolling Stone.[3][4] In 2017, Time recognized McGowan as one of the Silence Breakers, the magazine's Person of the Year, for speaking out about sexual assault and harassment.[4]\nMcGowan was born in Certaldo, Tuscany,[1] to American couple Daniel McGowan, an artist,[1] and Terri, a writer. She also has two half-siblings.[5] Her father ran an Italian chapter of the Children of God, which he and his wife were members of until 1978.[6] McGowan spent her early childhood at the group's communes, often traveling through Europe with her parents.[5]\nThrough her father's art contacts in Italy, she became a child model and appeared in Vogue Bambini and various other Italian magazines. Her parents returned to the United States when she was 10 years old, and settled in Eugene, Oregon.[5][7] McGowan had an untraditional childhood, living as a teenage runaway in Portland, Oregon and associating with a group of drag queens in the city.[5][8] When her parents divorced, she lived with her father in Seattle, Washington, attended Roosevelt High School and Nova Alternative High School, and worked at McDonald's. She took ballet lessons until she was 13. At 15, she officially emancipated herself from her parents[9] and moved to Los Angeles.\nAfter making her Hollywood film debut with a brief role in the Pauly Shore comedy Encino Man (1992), McGowan was cast in the leading role in Gregg Araki's dark comedy The Doom Generation (1995), which revolved around a threesome of teens who embark on a sex and violence-filled journey. The film brought her a much wider recognition and the attention of film critics; she received a nomination for Best Debut Performance at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards.  McGowan next obtained the role of Tatum Riley in the slasher cult film Scream (1996), as the  casting director believed she best embodied the \"spunky\", \"cynical\" but \"innocent\" nature of the ill-fated character.[10] Upon its release, the film became a huge critical and financial success, grossing over $100 million in North America and $173 million worldwide.[11] Amid her growing public profile, she was the cover model for the Henry Mancini tribute album Shots in the Dark, which was released in 1996, and became the face of American clothing company Bebe from 1998 to 1999.\nIn 1997, she appeared in the short film Seed, directed by San Francisco-born filmmaker Karin Thayer, and played opposite Peter O'Toole in the 1998 film adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel Phantoms. McGowan spent the majority of the late 1990s headlining a variety of independent films, including roles in Nowhere (1997), where she reunited with Araki, as well as Southie (1996), Going All the Way (1997), Lewis and Clark and George (1997), and Devil in the Flesh (1998), where she usually played seductive and mysterious characters. She gained much attention for the revealing fishnet outfit she wore to the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.[12][13][14][15]\nIn the dark comedy Jawbreaker (1999), she portrayed Courtney Shayne, a popular yet malevolent high school student who tries to cover up her involvement in a classmate's murder. McGowan based her performance on that of Gene Tierney's sociopathic character in Leave Her to Heaven (1945).[16] To accompany the release of the film, Imperial Teen's music video for the song Yoo Hoo featured McGowan as her character harassing the band members with jawbreakers.[17] Jawbreaker was a critical and commercial failure, but found success through home video release and subsequent television airings; it has developed a cult following.[18] McGowan earned a nomination for Best Villain at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards.\nIn 2001, McGowan obtained the role of Paige Matthews in the popular WB supernatural drama series Charmed, as a replacement for the lead actress Shannen Doherty, who had left the show. In the show, about the trio of witches using their combined powers to protect innocent lives from evil beings, McGowan played the character from season four until its final eighth season. In a review of the fourth season, Leigh H. Edwards of PopMatters added that the addition of Paige was \"contrived and clunky\", but welcomed the idea of McGowan joining the show as a witch \"since she has major goth cred as Marilyn Manson's former flame\".[19] DVD Verdict's Cynthia Boris wrote that McGowan brought \"a youthfulness\" and \"a fresh viewer perspective\" to Charmed, further noting that \"fans have come to enjoy her presence on the show.\"[20] Sara Paige and Rachel Hyland of Geek Speak magazine described Paige as \"snarky, compassionate and whimsical\", and believed that \"McGowan was well-suited for the role.\"[21] At the 2001 Wand Awards, McGowan was nominated for Best New Cast Member and at the 2005 Family Television Awards, she won Favorite Sister, for her performance.\nMcGowan starred alongside Brendan Fraser, Bridget Fonda, and Whoopi Goldberg in the dark fantasy comedy Monkeybone (2001) as a cat girl from a limbo-like carnival landscape where nightmares are entertainment. Budgeted at US$75 million, the film only made US$7.6 million;[22] McGowan felt that film \"would've been incredible (at least the underworld part) if the men at 20th Century Fox (the suits) hadn't fired the director, a true artist, Henry Selick [half] the way through filming\", and called his dismissal a \"profoundly stupid move\".[23] During Charmed, McGowan portrayed actress-singer Ann-Margret in the CBS miniseries Elvis (2005), about the life of Elvis Presley. She also appeared briefly as the roommate of the titular character in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia (2006), a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria and opposite Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank.\nIn 2007, McGowan headlined Grindhouse, a double feature horror film by directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. In Rodriguez's segment, Planet Terror, she starred as a go-go dancer and the leader of a group of rebels attempting to survive an onslaught of zombie-like creatures as they feud with a rogue military unit, while in Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, she played a brief role as a victim of a misogynistic, psychopathic stuntman who targets young women with his \"death proof\" stunt car. While Grindhouse made a lackluster US$25.5 million in its theatrical release,[24] it was the subject of much media coverage and critical acclaim from critics; James Berardinelli found McGowan to be the \"standout here\" and Mick LaSalle considered the film as \"the best showcase of [McGowan] career so far\".[25][26]\nHer next film release, Fifty Dead Men Walking (2008), revolved around Martin McGartland, a British agent who went undercover into the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). McGowan played a woman in the upper ranks of the organisation who offers herself to McGartland. After the film concluded shooting, McGowan sparked controversy in the United Kingdom, where she stated that she would have joined the IRA had she lived in Belfast during the era and that her \"heart just broke for the cause\".[27] The film found a limited audience in theaters[28] while critical response was positive.[29] Also in 2008, McGowan took on a recurring role as a con artist on the acclaimed drama series Nip/Tuck, and co-hosted the TCM's film-series program The Essentials alongside Robert Osbourne, discussing classic Hollywood film.[30]\nIn 2010, McGowan shot a cameo in the Robert Rodriguez feature Machete, a role ultimately cut, but included on the DVD release, and played a semi-homeless junkie in the fantasy drama Dead Awake. In the 3-D sword and sorcery film Conan the Barbarian (2011), a reimagining of the 1982 film of the same name which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, McGowan starred as an evil half-human/half-witch.[31][32] Roger Ebert described her role as a \"piece of work\", writing: \"She has white pancake makeup, blood red lips, cute little facial tattoos and wickedly sharp metal talons on her fingers\".[33] Filming occurred between March and July 2010 in Bulgaria, and Conan was released on August 19, 2011.[34] Budgeted at US$90 million, the film received negative reviews,[35] and only grossed US$48.8 worldwide.[36]\nBesides her role in the big-budgeted Conan, McGowan starred in mainly independent productions during the early 2010s, such as the psychological thriller Rosewood Lane (2011) from director Victor Salva, the made-for-television film The Pastor's Wife (2011), alongside Michael Shanks, and a film adaptation of The Tell-Tale Heart, released in 2016. McGowan lent her voice to the video games Darkwatch, playing a femme fatale named Tala, and Terminator Salvation, as a troubled soldier named Angie Salter. She guest-starred in an episode of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit as a grifter who targets New York sex clubs, and also in two episodes of Once Upon A Time between 2012 and 2014, playing the role of the young Cora Mills.\nIn the third season of Chosen (2014), a television series airing via Crackle, McGowan took on the role of an experienced hunter. She made her directorial debut with a short film called Dawn, which revolved around a teen from a strict family falls under the spell of a gas-station employee. The 17-minute piece premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, to critical acclaim; IndieWire noted: \"This was a real gem of a short film. Dawn's salient literary and cultural references, paired with the film's high production value, gorgeous shots, its slow-burner buildup and gripping conclusion, bring something to the table for everyone, and portends an excellent directorial career for Ms. McGowan\".[37]\nIn September 2015, McGowan released her debut single, titled \"RM486\". The song has strong feminist themes, with its title being a play on the abortion drug RU486 and McGowan's initials.[38] The Sound (2017), an independent Canadian horror film, starred McGowan as a best-selling author and paranormal investigator alongside Christopher Lloyd and Michael Eklund.[39] The Hollywood Reporter wrote of her role: \"Despite her sympathetic situation, [it] isn't a particularly interesting character. A dismissive attitude and superior self-regard don't improve her likability either. McGowan seems comfortable with the role, however [...]\".[40]\nOn January 30, 2018, McGowan released a memoir,  Brave, in which she details her childhood and her account of the assault by Harvey Weinstein and its aftermath.[41][42][43] On January 31, 2018, Citizen Rose, a four-part documentary series produced by Bunim/Murray Productions following McGowan and her role in the Me Too movement premiered.[44][45] In August 2018, McGowan was announced to receive the Inspiration Award at the GQ Men Of The Year Awards.[46]\nMcGowan appears in the art film Indecision IV, which combines dance and gender issues. \"Shot in one continuous take, the film [...] was created in May 2018, during a watershed moment in McGowan's life and is a physical expression of her state of mind at that time,\" a press statement stated. The piece was commissioned by UK's Heist Gallery, and is set to have special screenings at the Institute of Light in East London on December 15 and 16, with proceeds going to the charity Refuge.[47]\nWhile dating Marilyn Manson, McGowan appeared in a music video for the song \"Coma White\";[48] she performed backing vocals on the song \"Posthuman\".[49] Both of these songs appear on the album Mechanical Animals (1998).[50]\nMcGowan appeared on a Brian Transeau track called \"Superfabulous\", from his album Emotional Technology, which was also featured on the final Charmed soundtrack, The Final Chapter.[51] The song has been featured in several films, including Win a Date with Tad Hamilton![52] and Raising Helen. She wrote and recorded a song titled \"Protection\", which was featured in her film Strange Hearts (2011). McGowan has also appeared in the Imperial Teen music video for \"Yoo Hoo\",[53] which was featured on the Jawbreaker soundtrack, and she recorded the theme song from the film Dead Awake (2010).\nMcGowan has expressed interest in recording an album of her own. During an interview with Living TV, she said, \"I was actually thinking of going back and doing more soulful tunes and older tunes\u00a0... and I would love to, when I have a little bit more time.\" In the Charmed episode \"Sense and Sense Ability\", McGowan performed, in character, a cover of the Peggy Lee classic \"Fever\". She performed three songs from the Planet Terror portion of Grindhouse, released on the film's soundtrack by the Var\u00e8se Sarabande label.[54] The songs are entitled \"You Belong to Me\" (a Dean Martin/Jo Stafford cover), \"Useless Talent #32\", and \"Two Against the World\".\nShe appeared briefly in the music video for the 2014 single \"Break the Rules\" by Charli XCX.[55]\nMcGowan is an activist for LGBT rights[56][57] and campaigned against California's Proposition 8,[57] which sought to ban same-sex marriage in the state in 2008.[56] She is also known as an activist for Boston Terriers. She has two, named Bug and Fester, and has personally donated to various Boston Terrier rescues. McGowan reportedly encouraged friends to donate to Boston Terrier Rescue Net, and according to BTRN: \"Having fallen in love with Bug and Fester, her friends donated generously. It amounted to a considerable contribution, which will go a long way in helping BTRN and the needy volunteers who selflessly give to deserving Bostons.\"[58]\nMcGowan is a registered Republican, though she is a vocal critic of U.S. President Donald Trump.[59]\nIn late 2009, McGowan was among several celebrities who participated in the protest NOH8.[57]\nIn March 2018, McGowan came out as non-binary.[60] As of 2018, McGowan resides in Mayfair, London.[61]\nIn January 2019, McGowan pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour drug charge in Virginia concerning cocaine that was found in a wallet she left behind at Dulles International Airport in 2017. She received a US$2,500 fine and a suspended jail sentence.[62]\nIn the early 1990s, McGowan, then relatively unknown, was involved for two years with a man she refers to as William, who, she claims, kept buying her exercise equipment and fashion magazines in an effort to persuade her to get thinner. She developed an eating disorder in her unsuccessful efforts to get her weight down to 84 pounds (38\u00a0kg) like the women in the magazines. \"I never was able to get below 92 pounds (42\u00a0kg),\" she wrote later. \"I felt like a failure.\"[63]\nThat relationship and the eating disorder ended in early 1993 when McGowan met Brett Cantor, a part-owner of Hollywood's Dragonfly nightclub. She came to believe he was her soul mate;[64] however he was brutally stabbed to death in his house that July, leaving her \"shattered\". The killing remains unsolved, and McGowan continues to support efforts to identify a suspect and close the case.[63]\nMcGowan had a three-and-a-half-year relationship with rock musician Marilyn Manson. After a formal engagement lasting two years, McGowan ended the relationship in 2001 over \"lifestyle differences\".[65]\nPrior to the release of Grindhouse, there was speculation that McGowan was dating director Robert Rodriguez.[66][67] In May 2007, it was reported that they confirmed their relationship while appearing hand-in-hand at the Cannes Film Festival.[68] On October 12, 2007, it was announced by Zap2it.com that McGowan was engaged to Rodriguez.[69] They reportedly split in October 2009.[70]\nIn July 2013, after one year of dating, McGowan became engaged to artist Davey Detail.[71] They married on October 12, 2013 in Los Angeles.[72] In February 2016, she filed for divorce from Detail, citing irreconcilable differences.[73] The divorce was finalized in November 2016.[74]\nIn September 2008, McGowan caused controversy while promoting her film Fifty Dead Men Walking at a Toronto International Film Festival press conference, when she stated, \"I imagine, had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100% have been in the IRA. My heart just broke for the cause. Violence is not to be played out daily and provide an answer to problems, but I understand it.\" This prompted director Kari Skogland and the film's producers to issue a public apology, stating that McGowan's views did not reflect their own.[75]\nIn an August 2011 interview, McGowan talked about her experience working on the film Rosewood Lane with director Victor Salva, who is a convicted child molester and child pornographer,[76][77] stating, \"I still don't really understand the whole story or history there, and I'd rather not, because it's not really my business. But he's an incredibly sweet and gentle man.\"[76]\nIn May 2014, McGowan held a defiant party in support of the Brunei-owned Beverly Hills Hotel, despite a boycott over Brunei's anti-gay laws, which prescribes death by stoning for same-sex activities.[78] McGowan explained her stance on the issue thus: \"Boycotts only work when they hurt the target's bottom line. We are never going to affect the sultan's bottom line. He's worth $20 billion! This is a vanity project for him. It could sit empty for 100 years and he wouldn't even notice. But meanwhile, we're hurting all the wonderful, struggling people who work in the hotel. I'd like him to see that gays are real people. I think that's the only thing that would change his mind, not a boycott.\"[79]\nIn November 2014, while discussing misogyny and sexism during Bret Easton Ellis' podcast, McGowan criticized the gay community for not doing more to help the cause of women's rights, saying, \"I see now, basically, people who've fought for the right to stand on top of a float wearing an orange speedo and take molly. And, I see no help, and I see no paying it forward, and I have a huge problem with that. There are so many things to help and do, and I see no extending of a hand outside of the gay community to another community. And that's a problem for me.\" Rose McGowan also stated, \"Gays are misogynistic as straight men, if not more so. I have an indictment of the gay community right now. I'm actually really upset with them.\" The characterization of LGBT rights activism being centered on drug use and wearing revealing clothing in public were criticized as homophobic or transphobic.[80][81][82][83][84] She later apologized for generalizing gay men as misogynistic, but defended the rest of her comments.[85]\nIn June 2015, McGowan sparked controversy with a Twitter post making public what was perceived as a sexist casting call for an Adam Sandler film. McGowan later said, \"It was just so dumb. I was offended by the stupidity more than anything. I was offended by the fact that went through so many people's hands and nobody red flagged it. This is normal to so many people. It was probably even a girl that had to type it up. It's institutionally OK.\"[86] This reportedly led to McGowan being fired by her agent. She later clarified that talent agent Sheila Wenzel was not responsible for \"firing\" her after she took a stand against sexism in Hollywood.[87][88] \"I'm interested in making the industry better so that women following in my footsteps know that they don't have to take abuse just because she wants be creative,\" the actress told People magazine.[89]\nIn 2015, McGowan criticized Caitlyn Jenner for stating that \"the hardest part about being a woman is figuring out what to wear\", after Jenner had been named \"Woman of the Year\" by Glamour. McGowan stated, \"We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well f**cking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.\"[81][90] In response to accusations of transphobia, McGowan stated, \"Let me take this moment to point out that I am not, nor will I ever be, transphobic. The idea is laughable. Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism.\"[91]\nIn early January 2020, McGowan sparked controversy by apologizing to Iran for the United States' behavior in a tweet sent out in the hours after a US airstrike in Iraq killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani. She wrote, \"Dear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us. #Soleimani\" [92]\nWhen The New York Times revealed in October 2017 that she was part of a settlement involving movie mogul Harvey Weinstein in an alleged sexual harassment case, McGowan declined to comment.[93] \"Women fight on,\" she wrote afterwards. \"And to the men out there, stand up. We need you as allies.\" According to the Times, Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, including McGowan, who reached a $100,000 settlement with Weinstein after an encounter in a hotel room with the executive producer in 1997 during the Sundance Film Festival.[93][94]\nOn October 10, 2017, McGowan stated that Harvey Weinstein had behaved inappropriately with her. She accused actor Ben Affleck of lying after Affleck said in a statement that he was \"angry\" over Weinstein's alleged abuse of women, but did not indicate whether he knew about it.[95] Via Twitter, she also attacked other men in the movie industry, tweeting, \"All of you Hollywood 'A-list' golden boys are LIARS....You all knew.\"[96][97]\nOn October 12, McGowan alleged that Harvey Weinstein had raped her, and that Amazon Studios dropped her project after she complained.[98] On the same day, McGowan said that Twitter suspended her account for 12 hours after she repeatedly tweeted about Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct, including toward her.[99] Twitter explained that McGowan's account had violated its privacy policy because one of her tweets included a private phone number. The New York Times reported, \"Many Twitter users expressed outrage over Ms. McGowan's account being locked.\" After the tweet was removed, her account was unlocked several hours before the 12-hour ban was set to expire.[97] Through his lawyer, David Boies, Weinstein at one point hired the private intelligence agency Black Cube to spy on McGowan and to stop outlets such as The New York Times and The New Yorker from reporting their investigations on Harvey Weinstein. Boies' law firm, Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, had provided The Times with legal counsel over the course of the previous decade, including on one libel case. Upon learning that the firm was working to hinder its reporting on Weinstein while simultaneously representing them in other matters, The Times published a stern rebuke of the firm, calling their actions \"intolerable conduct, a grave betrayal of trust, and a breach of the basic professional standards that all lawyers are required to observe\".[100]\nOn February 7, 2018, Jill Messick, McGowan's manager at the time of the alleged rape in 1997, died by suicide.[101] Messick's family blamed Weinstein, the media, the public, and McGowan for her death.[102]\n</body></html>"

She has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics and six for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, winning in 2016 and 2017.\nMcKinnon debuted as a featured player on Saturday Night Live on April 7, 2012. She was promoted to repertory status in season 39 in 2013. Following Vanessa Bayer's departure, McKinnon is now the longest serving female cast member.[27]\nIn 2013, McKinnon was nominated for an EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Comedy.[28] McKinnon won the 2014 American Comedy Award for Best Supporting Actress, TV for her work on SNL.[29] In 2014, she was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series,[30] as well as for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics along with four of her colleagues for the song \"(Do It On My) Twin Bed\".[31] She was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the second time in 2015.[32] She won the following next year, becoming the first actor from SNL to win the award since Dana Carvey in 1993.\nMcKinnon began appearing as Hillary Clinton on the series leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The real Clinton appeared alongside her in a sketch during the show's season 41 premiere.[33] McKinnon has said that her impression of Hillary Clinton comes from a deep admiration, and that she \"unequivocally want[ed] her to win\" the 2016 presidential election.[34] On November 12, 2016, which was the first show after Clinton's loss in the election, she reprised the role to open the show with a solo performance of \"Hallelujah\" by Leonard Cohen, whose death was announced two days before her performance.[35] After the election, McKinnon began to impersonate Kellyanne Conway alongside Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump.

While presenting an award to Ellen DeGeneres at the 77th Golden Globe Awards in 2020, McKinnon opened up about being gay and thanked DeGeneres for making it less scary for her to accept her sexual orientation while watching her TV sitcom, Ellen.[45]\nShe has a pet cat, Nino Positano, whom she jokingly refers to as her son.[34] She does not use social media, citing fear that she will \"misrepresent her true feelings\".[46] While attending Columbia University, she dated Bari Weiss.[47]\nIn addition to theater, McKinnon is interested in science. She said to The New York Times, \"I've been a big astrophysics nut since I was 12. I have always had a real soft spot for the bizarreness of quantum mechanics.\"[48]\nShe is a vegetarian, which she discussed during her appearance on \u201cBreakfast, Lunch &amp; Dinner\u201d with David Chang.[49]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nAnderson Hays Cooper (born June 3, 1967)[1] is an American journalist, television personality, and author. He is the primary anchor of the CNN news show Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0. The program is usually broadcast live from a New York City studio; however, Cooper often broadcasts live from CNN's studios in Washington, D.C., or on location for breaking news stories. In addition, he is a correspondent for 60 Minutes. From September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as host of his own eponymous syndicated daytime talk show, Anderson Live.[2] Cooper was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger son of the writer Wyatt Emory Cooper and the artist, fashion designer, writer, and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and his maternal great-great-great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune.[3] He is also a descendant, through his mother, of Civil War brevet Major General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, who was with General William T. Sherman on his march through Georgia. Through his \"Vanderbilt\" line, he is a second cousin, once removed, of screenwriter James Vanderbilt. Cooper's media experience began early. As a baby, he was photographed by Diane Arbus for Harper's Bazaar.[4][5] At the age of three, Cooper was a guest on The Tonight Show on September 17, 1970, appearing with his mother.[citation needed] At the age of nine, he appeared on To Tell the Truth as an impostor. From age 10 to 13, Cooper modeled with Ford Models for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Macy's.[6] Cooper's father suffered a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery, and died January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. Cooper considers his father's book Families to be \"sort of a guide on...how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.\"[6] Cooper's older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, committed suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's death in the book A Mother's Story, in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug salbutamol. Anderson cites Carter's suicide for sparking his interest in journalism. \"Loss is a theme that I think a lot about, and it's something in my work that I dwell on. I think when you experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, you have questions about survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can't tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own?\"[6] Cooper was educated at the Dalton School, a private co-educational university preparatory day school in New York City. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a \"survival trip\". He contracted malaria on the trip and was hospitalized in Kenya. Describing the experience, Cooper wrote \"Africa was a place to forget and be forgotten in.\"[6][7][8] Cooper attended Yale University, where he resided in Trumbull College. He was inducted into the Manuscript Society, majoring in political science and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989.[9] During college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science. He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education[10][11] and is a self-proclaimed \"news junkie since [he] was in utero.\"[12] After his first correspondence work in the early 1990s, he took a break from reporting and lived in Vietnam for a year, during which time he studied the Vietnamese language at Vietnam National University, Hanoi.[13] After Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States.[14] Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government.[12] He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One. After reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi-8 camera with him, Cooper soon began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. He later returned to filming stories from a variety of war-torn regions around the globe, including Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda. On assignment for several years[when?], Cooper had very slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: \"I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad.\"[7] One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it: On the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, \"You need to take a look at what you were doing.\" \"And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective.\"[7] In 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000, he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole. My last year at ABC, I was working overnights anchoring this newscast, then during the day at 20/20. So I was sleeping in two- or four-hour shifts, and I was really tired and wanted a change. I wanted to clear my head and get out of news a little bit, and I was interested in reality TV\u2014and it was interesting.[12] Cooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin for the TV talk show Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery.[15] As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go into work. Cooper left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, \"Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.\"[12] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square. On September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said: I think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it. I think you have to be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, and talk about what you do know, and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it. I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem.[12] In 2005, Cooper covered a number of important stories, including the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi. In 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, \u201cYeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.\u201d[6] A contributor to Broadcasting & Cable magazine wrote: \"In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm.\"[16] In September 2005, the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper \"the anchorperson of the future.\"[17] Following the addition of Cooper, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that \"[Cooper's] name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue.\"[18] To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper's 360\u00b0 program would be expanded to 2 hours and shifted into the 10\u00a0pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Cooper's former 7\u00a0pm ET slot. With \"no options\" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having \"mutually agreed\" with Jonathan Klein on the matter.[19] In early 2007, Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million.[20] In 2007, he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show which honors and recognizes extraordinary deeds by ordinary people. In October 2007, Cooper began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril, with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008.[21][22] In September 2010, Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Anderson (now titled Anderson Live).[23] The show premiered on September 12, 2011,[24] and, as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0.[25][26] On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Anderson Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Anderson Live aired on May 30, 2013. Along with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.[27] This made him the first openly gay person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election.[28] In 2017, Andy Cohen joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.[29][30] They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018.[31] Cooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent. Andy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015.[32][33] The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta.[33] The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.[34][35] Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching over 50 cities as of October 2018.[36] Cooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe.[37] A freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including Details magazine.[38] In May 2006, Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, Dispatches from the Edge, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book's proceeds are donated to charity.[39] The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list on June 18, 2006.[40] In 2017, Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss. Complied from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt's tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave \"nothing left unsaid\" between the pair. [41] It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication. [42] Cooper has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus \"Stan\" Stokowski (b. 1950), and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria Vanderbilt's ten-year marriage to the conductor Leopold Stokowski.[43] While promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey that he had dyslexia as a child.[44] In August 2007, he confirmed his \"mild dyslexia\" on The Tonight Show to Jay Leno, who also has dyslexia. Cooper is openly gay; according to The New York Times, he is \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television.\"[45] For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews. On July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part: I've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something\u2014something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. This is distressing because it is simply not true. ... The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud.[46] In 2014, Cooper and his partner purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut.[47] Apple CEO Tim Cook turned to Cooper for advice before he subsequently made the decision to publicly come out as gay.[48] Also in 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates' Finding Your Roots, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the Southern United States.[49][50] In March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and his long-time boyfriend Benjamin Maisani had split up.[51]",

He is the primary anchor of the CNN news show Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0. The program is usually broadcast live from a New York City studio; however, Cooper often broadcasts live from CNN's studios in Washington, D.C., or on location for breaking news stories.  In addition, he is a correspondent for 60 Minutes.\nFrom September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as host of his own eponymous syndicated daytime talk show, Anderson Live.[2]\nCooper was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger son of the writer Wyatt Emory Cooper and the artist, fashion designer, writer, and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and his maternal great-great-great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune.[3] He is also a descendant, through his mother, of Civil War brevet Major General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, who was with General William T. Sherman on his march through Georgia. Through his \"Vanderbilt\" line, he is a second cousin, once removed, of screenwriter James Vanderbilt.\nCooper's media experience began early. As a baby, he was photographed by Diane Arbus for Harper's Bazaar.[4][5]  At the age of three, Cooper was a guest on The Tonight Show on September 17, 1970, appearing with his mother.[citation needed] At the age of nine, he appeared on To Tell the Truth as an impostor.  From age 10 to 13, Cooper modeled with Ford Models for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Macy's.[6]\nCooper's father suffered a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery, and died January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. Cooper considers his father's book Families to be \"sort of a guide on...how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.\"[6]\nCooper's older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, committed suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's death in the book A Mother's Story, in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug salbutamol. Anderson cites Carter's suicide for sparking his interest in journalism.\n\"Loss is a theme that I think a lot about, and it's something in my work that I dwell on. I think when you experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, you have questions about survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can't tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own?\"[6]\nCooper was educated at the Dalton School, a private co-educational university preparatory day school in New York City. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a \"survival trip\". He contracted malaria on the trip and was hospitalized in Kenya. Describing the experience, Cooper wrote \"Africa was a place to forget and be forgotten in.\"[6][7][8] Cooper attended Yale University, where he resided in Trumbull College. He was inducted into the Manuscript Society, majoring in political science and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989.[9]\nDuring college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science. He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education[10][11] and is a self-proclaimed \"news junkie since [he] was in utero.\"[12] After his first correspondence work in the early 1990s, he took a break from reporting and lived in Vietnam for a year, during which time he studied the Vietnamese language at Vietnam National University, Hanoi.[13]\nAfter Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States.[14] Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government.[12] He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One.\nAfter reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi-8 camera with him, Cooper soon began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. He later returned to filming stories from a variety of war-torn regions around the globe, including Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda.\nOn assignment for several years[when?], Cooper had very slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: \"I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad.\"[7] One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:\nOn the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, \"You need to take a look at what you were doing.\" \"And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective.\"[7]\nIn 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000, he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole.\nMy last year at ABC, I was working overnights anchoring this newscast, then during the day at 20/20. So I was sleeping in two- or four-hour shifts, and I was really tired and wanted a change. I wanted to clear my head and get out of news a little bit, and I was interested in reality TV\u2014and it was interesting.[12]\nCooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin for the TV talk show Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery.[15] As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go into work.\nCooper left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, \"Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.\"[12] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square.\nOn September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 on CNN.  Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said:\nI think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it. I think you have to be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, and talk about what you do know, and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it. I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem.[12]\nIn 2005, Cooper covered a number of important stories, including the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi.\nIn 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, \u201cYeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.\u201d[6] A contributor to Broadcasting &amp; Cable magazine wrote: \"In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm.\"[16]\nIn September 2005, the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper \"the anchorperson of the future.\"[17]\nFollowing the addition of Cooper, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that \"[Cooper's] name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue.\"[18] To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper's 360\u00b0 program would be expanded to 2 hours and shifted into the 10\u00a0pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Cooper's former 7\u00a0pm ET slot. With \"no options\" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having \"mutually agreed\" with Jonathan Klein on the matter.[19]\nIn early 2007, Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million.[20]\nIn 2007, he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show which honors and recognizes extraordinary deeds by ordinary people.\nIn October 2007, Cooper began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril, with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008.[21][22]\nIn September 2010, Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Anderson (now titled Anderson Live).[23] The show premiered on September 12, 2011,[24] and, as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0.[25][26] On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Anderson Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Anderson Live aired on May 30, 2013.\nAlong with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.[27] This made him the first openly gay person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election.[28]\nIn 2017, Andy Cohen joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.[29][30] They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018.[31]\nCooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent.\nAndy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their  conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015.[32][33] The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta.[33] The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.[34][35] Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching over 50 cities as of October 2018.[36]\nCooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe.[37]\nA freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including Details magazine.[38]\nIn May 2006, Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, Dispatches from the Edge, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book's proceeds are donated to charity.[39] The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list on June 18, 2006.[40]\nIn 2017, Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss. Complied from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt's tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave \"nothing left unsaid\" between the pair. [41] It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication. [42]\nCooper has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus \"Stan\" Stokowski (b. 1950), and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria Vanderbilt's ten-year marriage to the conductor Leopold Stokowski.[43]\nWhile promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey that he had dyslexia as a child.[44] In August 2007, he confirmed his \"mild dyslexia\" on The Tonight Show to Jay Leno, who also has dyslexia.\nCooper is openly gay; according to The New York Times, he is \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television.\"[45] For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews.\nOn July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part:\nI've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something\u2014something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. This is distressing because it is simply not true. ... The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud.[46]\nIn 2014, Cooper and his partner purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut.[47] Apple CEO Tim Cook turned to Cooper for advice before he subsequently made the decision to publicly come out as gay.[48]\nAlso in 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates' Finding Your Roots, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the Southern United States.[49][50]\nIn March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and his long-time boyfriend Benjamin Maisani had split up.[51]\n</body></html>"
