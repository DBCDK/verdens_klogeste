                "text": "no title\n\nMichael Richard Pence (born June 7, 1959) is an American politician and lawyer serving as the 48th vice president of the United States. He previously was the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017 and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. He is the younger brother of U.S. Representative Greg Pence. Born and raised in Columbus, Indiana, Pence graduated from Hanover College and earned a law degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law before entering private practice. After losing two bids for a U.S. congressional seat in 1988 and 1990, he became a conservative radio and television talk show host from 1994 to 1999. Pence was elected to the United States Congress in 2000 and represented Indiana's 2nd congressional district and Indiana's 6th congressional district in the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. He served as the chairman of the House Republican Conference from 2009 to 2011.[2] Pence described himself as a \"principled conservative\" and supporter of the Tea Party movement,[3] stating that he was \"a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\"[4] Pence successfully sought the Republican nomination for the 2012 Indiana gubernatorial election when term-limited Mitch Daniels retired. He defeated former speaker John R. Gregg in the closest gubernatorial election in 50 years.[5][6] Upon becoming governor in January 2013, Pence initiated the largest tax cut in Indiana's history and pushed for more funding for education initiatives. Pence signed bills intended to restrict abortions, including one that prohibited abortions if the reason for the procedure was the fetus's race, gender, or disability.[7] After Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), he encountered fierce resistance from moderate members of his party, the business community, and LGBT advocates. The backlash against the RFRA led Pence to amend the bill to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and other criteria. Pence was inaugurated as vice president of the United States on January 20, 2017. He had withdrawn his gubernatorial reelection campaign in July to become the running mate of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who went on to win the presidential election on November 8, 2016. Michael Richard Pence was born June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Nancy Jane (n\u00e9e Cawley) and Edward Joseph Pence Jr.,[8][9] who ran a group of gas stations.[10][11] His father served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph.[12] His maternal family were Irish Catholic Democrats.[13] Pence was named after his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from County Sligo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island, following an aunt and his brother James, and became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois.[14][15][16][17] His maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare.[18][19] Pence graduated from Columbus North High School in 1977. He earned a BA degree in history from Hanover College in 1981, and a JD degree from the Indiana University's Robert H. McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis in 1986.[20] While at Hanover, Pence joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, where he became the chapter president.[21] After graduating from Hanover, Pence was an admissions counselor at the college from 1981 to 1983.[22] In his childhood and early adulthood, Pence was a Roman Catholic and a Democrat. He volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party in 1976 and voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election,[1][16] and has said he was originally inspired to get involved in politics by people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.[1] While in college, Pence became an evangelical, born-again Christian, to the great disappointment of his mother.[1][16] His political views also started shifting to the right during this time in his life, something which Pence attributes to the \"common-sense conservatism of Ronald Reagan\" with which he began to identify.[1][23] After graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice.[24] He ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in 1988 and in 1990. In 1991, he became the president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a self-described free-market think tank and a member of the State Policy Network, a position he held until 1993.[25][26][27] Shortly after his first congressional campaign in 1988, radio station WRCR-FM in Rushville, Indiana, hired Pence to host a weekly half-hour radio show, Washington Update with Mike Pence.[28] In 1992, Pence began hosting a daily talk show on WRCR, The Mike Pence Show, in addition to a Saturday show on WNDE in Indianapolis.[25][28][29][30] Pence called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\" since he considered himself politically conservative while not as bombastic as Limbaugh.[31][32] Beginning on April 11, 1994, Network Indiana syndicated The Mike Pence Show statewide.[33] With a 9:00\u00a0a.m. to noon (ET) time slot, the program reached as many as 18 radio stations in Indiana, including WIBC in Indianapolis.[25] Pence ended his radio show in September 1999 to focus on his 2000 campaign for Congress, which he eventually won.[34] From 1995 to 1999, Pence hosted a weekend public affairs TV show also titled The Mike Pence Show on Indianapolis TV station WNDY.[28][35] In 1988, Pence ran for Congress against Democratic incumbent Philip Sharp, but lost.[36] He ran against Sharp again in 1990, quitting his job in order to work full-time in the campaign, but once again was unsuccessful.[36] During the race, Pence used \"political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife.\"[37] While the spending was not illegal at the time, it reportedly undermined his campaign.[37] During the 1990 campaign, Pence ran a television advertisement in which an actor, dressed in a robe and headdress and speaking in a thick Middle Eastern accent, thanked his opponent, Sharp, for doing nothing to wean the United States off imported oil as chairman of a House subcommittee on energy and power.[37][38] In response to criticism, Pence's campaign responded that the ad was not about Arabs; rather, it concerned Sharp's lack of leadership.[37][38] In 1991, Pence wrote an essay, \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner\", published in the Indiana Policy Review, in which he apologized for running negative ads against Sharp.[31][37][39] Mike Pence rejuvenated his political career by running for the U.S. House of Representatives again in 2000, this time winning the seat in Indiana's 2nd congressional district after six-year incumbent David M. McIntosh opted to run for governor of Indiana. The district (renumbered as Indiana's 6th congressional district beginning in 2002) comprises all or portions of 19 counties in eastern Indiana. As a congressman, Pence adopted the slogan he had used on the radio, describing himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\"[4] While in Congress, Pence belonged to the Tea Party Caucus.[40] In his first year in office, Pence opposed President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act in 2001,[41] as well as President Bush's Medicare prescription drug expansion the following year.[42] Pence was re-elected four more times by comfortable margins. In the 2006, 2008, and 2010 House elections, he defeated Democrat Barry Welsh.[43][44][45] Pence began to climb the party leadership structure and from 2005 to 2007 was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House Republicans.[46] In November 2006, Pence announced his candidacy for leader of the Republican Party (minority leader) in the United States House of Representatives.[47] Pence's release announcing his run for minority leader focused on a \"return to the values\" of the Newt Gingrich-headed 1994 Republican Revolution.[47] However, he lost the bid to Representative John Boehner of Ohio by a vote of 168 for Boehner, 27 for Pence, and one for Representative Joe Barton of Texas.[48] In January 2009, Pence was elected as the Republican Conference chairman, the third-highest-ranking Republican leadership position. He ran unopposed and was elected unanimously. He was the first representative from Indiana to hold a House leadership position since 1981.[2] During Pence's twelve years in the House, he introduced 90 bills and resolutions; none became law.[49] His committee assignments in the House were the following: In 2008, Esquire magazine listed Pence as one of the ten best members of Congress, writing that Pence's \"unalloyed traditional conservatism has repeatedly pitted him against his party elders.\"[56] Pence was mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for president in 2008[57] and 2012.[58] In September 2010, he was the top choice for president in a straw poll conducted by the Values Voter Summit.[59][60] That same year he was encouraged to run against incumbent Democratic senator Evan Bayh,[61][62][63] but opted not to enter the race,[64] even after Bayh unexpectedly announced that he would retire.[65] In May 2011, Mike Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012.[66] Incumbent Republican governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited. He ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels.[67][68] Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote and less than 3% ahead of Democrat John R. Gregg, and trailed by Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham.[69] Pence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013.[70] Pence \"inherited a $2\u00a0billion budget reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state\u00a0... added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections.\"[71] The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2\u00a0billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14\u00a0billion annual state budget include $24\u00a0million cut from colleges and universities; $27\u00a0million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA);[72] and $12\u00a0million cut from the Department of Correction.[73] During Pence's term as governor, the unemployment rate reflected the national average.[74] Indiana's job growth lagged slightly behind the national trend.[75] In 2014, Indiana's economy was among the slowest-growing in the United States, with 0.4 percent GDP growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector.[76] Carrier Corp. and United Technologies Electronic Controls (UTEC) announced in 2016 that they would be closing two facilities in Indiana, sending 2,100 jobs to Mexico; the Trump campaign criticized the moves[77] and Pence expressed \"deep disappointment\".[78][79] Pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received.[79][80] The Indiana Economic Development Corporation led by Pence had approved $24\u00a0million in incentives to 10 companies who sent jobs abroad. $8.7\u00a0million had been paid out by August 2016.[77] In 2013, Pence signed a law blocking local governments in Indiana from requiring businesses to offer higher wages or benefits beyond those required by federal law. In 2015, Pence also repealed an Indiana law that required construction companies working on publicly funded projects to pay a prevailing wage.[81][82][83][84] Indiana enacted right-to-work legislation under Pence's predecessor, Republican governor Mitch Daniels. Under Pence, the state successfully defended this legislation against a labor challenge.[82] In 2013, Pence also announced the formation of the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, a life sciences research facility supported with $25\u00a0million in startup funds from the state.[85] Pence made tax reform, namely a 10 percent income-tax rate cut, a priority for 2013.[86][87] While he did not get the 10 percent cut he advocated, Pence did accomplish his goal of cutting state taxes.[86] Legislators cut the income tax by five percent and also killed the inheritance tax.[86] Speaker of the House Brian Bosma said the legislative package was the \"largest tax cut in our state's history, about $1.1\u00a0billion dollars.\"[88] By signing Senate Bill 1, the state corporate income tax would be dropped from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent by 2021, which would be the second-lowest corporate income tax in the nation.[89] The law also permitted Indiana counties to eliminate the business personal property tax on new equipment and let them exempt small businesses with less than $20,000 worth of equipment from paying personal property taxes.[89] On June 12, 2013, the Indiana Legislature overrode Pence's veto of a bill to retroactively authorize a local tax. Lawmakers overrode Pence's veto in a 68\u201323 vote in the House and a 34\u201312 one in the Senate.[90] Republican legislators overwhelmingly voted against Pence, while most Democrats supported his veto.[91] The Jackson\u2013Pulaski tax fix, one of three bills vetoed by Pence during the session, addressed a 15-year-old county income tax which had been imposed to fund the construction of jail facilities with the stipulation that the tax be lowered by one percent after the first several years. The reduction was not implemented and thus county residents paid an additional one percent tax that they were legally not required to pay. The bill, which was passed by a huge majority of legislators and subsequently vetoed by Pence, allowed money to be kept and not returned to the taxpayers as would have otherwise been necessary.[91][92] As governor, Pence pressed for a balanced budget amendment to the state's constitution. He initially proposed the initiative in his State of the State address in January 2015. The legislation passed the state Senate.[93] Indiana has had AAA credit ratings with the three major credit-rating agencies since 2010, before Pence took office; these ratings were maintained throughout Pence's tenure.[94] In 2014, Pence supported the Indiana Gateway project,[95] a $71.4\u00a0million passenger and freight rail improvement initiative paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus package), which Pence had voted against while a congressman.[96] In October 2015, Pence \"announced plans to pay off a $250\u00a0million federal loan\" to cover unemployment insurance payments which had spiked during the recession.[71] In March 2016, Pence signed legislation to fund a $230\u00a0million two-year road-funding package.[71] During his tenure as governor, Pence supported significant increases in education funding to pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, but frequently clashed with supporters of traditional public schools.[97][98] In 2014, a little over one year after taking office, Pence helped establish a $10\u00a0million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans (several of whom opposed the proposal) to approve the plan.[97][98] Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, \"getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool.\"[98] Demand for enrollment in the program \"far outstripped\" capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80\u00a0million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding,[97] arguing that \"Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion.\"[99] After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds.[97][100] In 2015, Pence secured significant increases in charter-school funding from the legislation, although he did not get everything he had proposed.[98] Legislation signed into law by Pence in 2013 greatly increased the number of students in Indiana who qualify for school vouchers, making it one of the largest voucher programs in the United States.[101][102][103][104] The annual cost of the program is estimated to be $53\u00a0million for the 2015\u201316 school year.[103][104] Pence opposed the Common Core State Standards Initiative, calling for the repeal of the standards in his 2014 State of the State address. The Indiana General Assembly then passed a bill to repeal the standards, becoming the first state to do so.[97][98] Despite successful advocacy for more funding for pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, Pence has frequently clashed with teachers unions and supporters of public schooling.[97][98] In one of his first acts as governor, Pence removed control of the Educational Employment Relations Board, which was in charge of handling conflicts between unions and school boards, from Glenda Ritz, a Democrat who was the Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction (a separately elected position in the state).[105] Pence created a new \"Center for Education and Career Innovation\" (CECI) to coordinate efforts between schools and the private sector; Ritz opposed the Center, viewing it as a \"power grab\" and encroachment on her own duties. Pence eventually disestablished the Center in order to help defuse the conflict.[97][98] In May 2015, Pence signed a bill stripping Ritz of much of her authority over standardized testing and other education issues, and reconstituting the State Board of Education dominated by Pence appointees.[106] The bill also allowed the board to appoint a chairman other than the Superintendent of Public Instruction starting in 2017, and added the State Board of Education (controlled by Pence) as a \"state educational authority\" along with the Department of Education (controlled by Ritz) for purposes of accessing sensitive student data.[106] Pence and Ritz also clashed over non-binding federal guidelines that advised Indiana public schools must treat transgender students in a way that corresponds to their gender identity, even if their education files indicate a different gender.[107] During Pence's term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly \"repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana's energy efficiency efforts.\"[108] Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that \"Indiana is a pro-coal state,\" expressing support for an \"all-of-the-above energy strategy,\" and stating: \"we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the EPA until we bring their war on coal to an end.\"[108][109] In 2015, Pence sent a letter to President Obama denouncing the EPA's Clean Power Plan (which would regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants) and stating that Indiana would refuse to comply with the plan.[108][110] Indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan.[108] In 2016, Pence said that even if legal challenges failed, Indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions.[111] In 2014, over the opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property.[112] In 2015, following a shooting in Chattanooga, Pence recruited the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard on concealed carry. Some National Guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue.[113] In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary's still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns.[114][115] The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to Indiana, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana Attorney General Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as \"an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government.\"[115] In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer in Indiana.[116] In 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a Superfund site. Governor Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency;[117] his successor Governor Eric Holcomb has issued Executive Order 17-13, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago.[118][119] The site of several former lead smelting plants was first identified as a health concern by the EPA in 1997.[120] Beginning in December 2014, there was an HIV outbreak in Southern Indiana.[121] In 2011, Planned Parenthood ran five rural clinics in Indiana. They tested for HIV and offered prevention, intervention and counseling for better health. The one in Scott County performed no abortions.[122] The Republican-controlled legislature and Pence defunded Planned Parenthood.[123] Scott County has been without an HIV testing center since 2013.[122] Pence had long been a vocal opponent of needle exchange programs, which allow drug users to trade in used syringes for sterile ones in order to stop the spread of diseases, despite evidence that such programs prevent the spread of AIDS and hepatitis C, and do not increase drug abuse.[121] In March 2015, after the outbreak began, Pence allowed at least five counties to open needle exchanges, but did not move to lift the state ban on funding for needle exchanges.[121] Critics say Pence's compromise has been ineffective because counties had no way to pay for needle exchanges themselves. Indiana State Health Commissioner Jerome Adams defended Pence, saying that publicly funded needle exchange programs are controversial in many conservative communities.[124] In 2015, Pence and the Obama administration agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.[125][126] As part of the expansion, called the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, Pence negotiated modifications to the program for Indiana that included co-payments by participants. The co-payments are linked to healthy behaviors on the part of the participants so that, for example, a participant who quit smoking would receive a lower co-payment. Participants can lose benefits for failing to make the payments.[127] The required contribution would be about 2% of income. Critics say those who already struggle to buy food and housing will have even more difficulty paying their 2%. One critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. A service provider said the program \"wins the award for bureaucratic complexity and red tape.\"[128] In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. National Public Radio/Side Effects Public Media said the application used \"misleading and inaccurate information.\"[129] On March 26, 2015, Pence signed Indiana Senate Bill 101, also known as the Indiana \"religious objections\" bill (Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA), into law.[130] The law's signing was met with criticism by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons.[131][132][133][134] Such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ spoke out against the law. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff condemned the law, with Salesforce.com saying it would halt its plans to expand in the state.[135][136] Angie's List announced that they would cancel a $40\u00a0million expansion of their Indianapolis based headquarters over concerns with the law. The expansion would have moved 1000 jobs into the state.[137] Thousands protested against the policy.[131] Five Republican state representatives voted against the bill, and Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, criticized it as sending the \"wrong signal\" about the state.[138] Pence defended the law, saying it was not about discrimination. In an appearance on the ABC News program This Week with George Stephanopoulos[139] he said, \"We are not going to change this law,\" while refusing to answer whether examples of discrimination against LGBT people given by Eric Miller of anti-LGBT group Advance America would be legal under the law.[140] Pence denied the law permitted discrimination and wrote in a March 31, 2015, Wall Street Journal op-ed, \"If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn't eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it.\"[141] In the wake of the backlash against the RFRA, on April 2, 2015, Pence signed legislation revising the law to protect against potential discrimination.[142] Pence received heavy criticism from liberals at the time of signing the religious freedom law, who labeled him as anti-gay. In 2018, emails released to the Associated Press showed that conservatives had also opposed his changing the law.[143] In March 2016, Pence, as Indiana governor, signed into law H.B. 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. The bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus' race or gender or a fetal abnormality. In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state.[144][145][146] The law was described as \"exceptional for its breadth\"; if implemented, it would have made Indiana \"the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome.\"[145] Days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial.[145] The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by United States 7th Circuit.[147] In June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he apologized.[148] On January 26, 2015, it was widely reported that Pence had planned to launch a state-run, taxpayer-funded news service for Indiana.[149] The service, called \"JustIN\", was to be overseen by a former reporter for The Indianapolis Star, and would feature breaking news, stories written by press secretaries, and light features.[149] At the time, it was reported that the two employees who would run the news service would be paid a combined $100,000 yearly salary.[149] The target audience was small newspapers which had limited staff, but the site would also serve to communicate directly with the public. The publisher of the Commercial Review of Portland, Indiana, said, \"I think it's a ludicrous idea\u00a0... the notion of elected officials presenting material that will inevitably have a pro-administration point of view is antithetical to the idea of an independent press.\"[149] There was speculation that the news service would publish pro-administration stories that would make Pence look good in the event of a presidential run.[150] According to Associated Press, the idea \"of stories prewritten for the media set off a wave of criticism from journalists around the country, who likened the Indiana endeavor to state-run media in Russia and China. Headlines like 'Pravda in the Plains' accompanied calls for Pence to scrap the idea.\"[151] David A. Graham of The Atlantic regarded the announcement of JustIN as evidence of a disturbing changing trend in how the public gets news.[152] After a week or so of controversy about the idea, Pence scrapped the idea saying, \"However well-intentioned, after thorough review of the preliminary planning and careful consideration of the concerns expressed, I am writing you to inform you that I have made a decision to terminate development of the JustIN website immediately.\"[153] As governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana.[154] In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence's order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence has appealed.[154] In December 2015, Pence said that \"calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional\".[155] Pence \"repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright.\"[156][157][158] As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records. In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence's contacts.[159] While this use is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues.[160] In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure.[160] Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence's use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence's past attacks on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state.[160] In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence's personal AOL account email correspondence.[156] Pence ran for a second term as governor. He was unopposed in the May 3, 2016, Republican primary for governor. He was to face Democrat John R. Gregg, former speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, in a rematch of the 2012 race. However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate.[161] Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence's place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate.[162][163] Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election.[164] Pence endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.[57] Donald Trump considered naming Pence as his vice presidential running mate along with other finalists including New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich.[165] Pence had stronger connections at the time to the politically influential big donors, the Kochs, than Trump did.[166][167][168][169][170] As was widely reported on July 14, The Indianapolis Star wrote that Pence would end his re-election campaign and accept the Republican vice presidential nomination instead.[171] The following day, Trump officially announced on Twitter that Pence would be his running mate.[172][173][174] Immediately after the announcement, Pence said he was \"very supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States\".[175] Pence said he was \"absolutely\" in sync with Trump's Mexican wall proposal, stating that Mexico was \"absolutely\" going to pay for it.[176] According to a FiveThirtyEight rating of candidates' ideology, Pence was the most conservative vice-presidential candidate in the last forty years.[177] Pence said his role model as vice president would be Dick Cheney.[178] During Pence's preparations for the vice presidential debate in October 2016, Scott Walker played the role of Tim Kaine.[179] (In Kaine's own debate prep, Robert Barnett was selected to play Pence.)[180] In response to lewd comments made by Donald Trump in 2005,[181] and reported in The Washington Post on Friday, October 7, 2016, Pence said \"I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them\", but Pence made clear that he was standing by the presidential candidate.[182] The candidate's campaign substituted Pence for Trump at a campaign event from which Trump was \"uninvited\" by Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives.[183] According to The New York Times, Pence called Trump on October 8, 2016, and told him he would not appear at the campaign event with Ryan as a replacement for Trump and that Trump would need to handle the next 48 hours on his own, as Pence said he did not think he would be an effective surrogate for Trump.[184] On October 10, 2016, Pence appeared on CNN and said it was \"absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket\" and that it is the \"greatest honor of my life\" to be nominated as Trump's running mate.[185] According to Bob Woodward's 2018 book Fear: Trump in the White House, in the midst of the Access Hollywood tape scandal in October 2016, then Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told Trump he should drop out of the race for the good of the party and that Pence had agreed to replace Trump on the top of the ticket as the Republican presidential nominee and that former United States secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had agreed to be Pence's running mate.[186] On October 27, 2016, a chartered Boeing 737 carrying Pence skidded off a runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York City and was slowed by an engineered materials arrestor system; no injuries were reported.[187] On November 8, 2016, Pence was elected vice president of the United States as Trump's running mate. Soon after the election, he was appointed chairman of President-elect Trump's transition team.[188] During the transition phase of the Trump administration, Pence was reported as holding a large degree of influence in the administration due to his roles as a mediator between Trump and congressional Republicans, for reassuring conservatives about Trump's conservative credentials, and his influence in determining Donald Trump's cabinet.[189][190] Pence is the sixth vice president from Indiana, following Schuyler Colfax (1869\u20131873), Thomas A. Hendricks (1885), Charles W. Fairbanks (1905\u20131909), Thomas R. Marshall (1913\u20131921) and Dan Quayle (1989\u20131993). On January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence became the 48th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by justice Clarence Thomas, using Ronald Reagan's Bible, opened to 2 Chronicles 7:14, \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land\", which is the same verse Reagan used for his swearing-ins as governor and president. Pence also used his personal Bible which he opens every morning.[191] On the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security.[192] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017.[193] Pence also sat in on calls made by President Trump to foreign heads of government and state such as Russian president Vladimir Putin[194] and Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.[195][196] In January, Pence appointed Josh Pitcock as his chief of staff, who he had known from his gubernatorial and congressional days.[197] The following month, Jarrod Agen was tapped as deputy assistant to the president and director of communications to the vice president; his previous job being chief of staff for governor of Michigan Rick Snyder through the time of the Flint water crisis.[198] In July, Pitcock stepped down as chief of staff, and was succeeded in the position by Nick Ayers, another longtime Pence advisor.[199] On February 7, 2017, Pence, in his dual constitutional role as president of the United States Senate made the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member.[200][201] He cast the deciding vote to break a fifty-fifty tie to confirm Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education.[202] Pence cast his second tie-breaking vote on March 30, voting to advance a bill to defund Planned Parenthood.[203] In 2018, Pence broke a tie to confirm Jonathan A. Kobes for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This was the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a judicial nominee in U.S. history. As of 2019[update], Pence has cast 13 tie-breaking votes, seventh-most in history and more than his previous four predecessors (Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, Al Gore and Dan Quayle) cast combined (Cheney broke eight ties, Gore broke four ties, and Quayle and Biden did not cast a tie-breaking vote). In April, Pence made a tour of the Asia-Pacific region. In South Korea, he met acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn and condemned North Korea's latest missile launch.[204][205][205][206] In Japan, Pence met Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe and pledged to work with Japan, South Korea, and China \"to achieve a peaceable resolution and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\" adding \"The era of strategic patience is over and while all options are on the table\".[207][208] Pence subsequently traveled to Jakarta, Indonesia, where he met with president Joko Widodo, toured the largest mosque in the region (the Istiqlal Mosque), and praised moderate Islam.[209][210] Pence ended his trip with stops in Sydney, Australia (where, after meeting with Malcolm Turnbull, he said the U.S. \"intends to honor\" a U.S.\u2013Australia refugee resettlement agreement),[211] and Oahu, Hawaii and American Samoa.[212] On May 21, 2017, Pence delivered the commencement address at the University of Notre Dame. Traditionally, the president delivers the address at Notre Dame in his inaugural year, but in 2017 Pence was invited instead when Trump decided to speak at Liberty University.[213][214][215][216] On October 8, 2017, Pence walked out of a game between the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers at Trump's request after members of the 49ers knelt during the national anthem. Shortly afterwards, Pence commented via Twitter, \"President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem\"; further adding, \"While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I don't think its too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag and our national anthem.\"[217] Pence was widely criticized by various people for what was considered a publicity stunt. Democratic representative Adam Schiff (CA-28) questioned how much taxpayer's money was used to fund Pence's actions,[218] and it was later estimated that the cost of it all was about $242,500.[219] 49ers safety Eric Reid (the second NFL player after Colin Kaepernick to participate in the protests) told reporters it was predictable that Pence would walk out, knowing that most of the team were protesting.[218] Reid also expressed doubt over the regularity Pence is in terms of attending Colts matches, and referenced a photograph of the vice president and his wife in Colts uniform that had been tweeted before the match,[218] although the official photograph (right) proved otherwise. The photograph in question was first published in 2014.[220] Sportswriter Peter King wrote that the furor surrounding Pence had overshadowed Peyton Manning, who was being honored by the Colts, saying, \"Pence trumped a day that belonged to the greatest football hero the state of Indiana has ever seen, and he did it for political purposes\u00a0... he stole Manning's last great day as a Colt. [He] will have to live with himself for that.\"[218] The following year, Pence reacted positively on Twitter, after NFL owners unanimously decided to approve a new policy requiring all players to stand (or, given the option to stay in the locker room) during the national anthem, despite not consulting the NFL Players' Association.[221] On February 1, 2018, it was announced that Pence would lead the presidential delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics, alongside his wife.[222] Much of Pence's time at PyeongChang was affected by the ongoing North Korean crisis. Prior to the opening ceremony, on February 9, Pence skipped on a dinner held by South Korean president Moon Jae-in, as he would have shared a table with North Korea's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam.[223] Instead, he met with four North Korean defectors in Pyeongtaek, alongside his special guest, Fred Warmbier (the father of Otto Warmbier, who was arrested in North Korea for attempted theft, and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, before returning to the U.S. in a comatose state).[224][225][226] At the ceremony, the Pences were seated in front of the North Korean delegates, and when North and South Korean athletes entered during the Parade of Athletes, they chose to stay seated, which prompted critics to accuse Pence of hypocrisy in regards to the NFL protests.[227][228] Pence was supposed to meet with the North Koreans on February 10, but they pulled out at the last minute.[229] Over the next few months, the North Koreans started communicating more with their neighbors, as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un secretly met with Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping in March and then Moon Jae-in in an historic inter-Korean summit in April,[230][231] and around the same time, a meeting between Trump and Kim was also proposed. On May 10, Pence accompanied Trump to Andrews Air Force Base as three American citizens were released by North Korea, and in an early morning interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl, he said seeing the men back on American soil \"was really one of the greatest joys of my life.\"[232][233] Talks broke down later that month following comments made by Pence and Trump, comparing the situation to events in Libya seven years previous, despite their voluntary disarmament of nuclear weapons in 2003.[234] North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui called Pence's remarks \"ignorant and stupid\".[235] On May 24, Trump abruptly called off the summit with Pence in attendance,[234] only for him to change his mind a day later,[236] later announcing that it would still be scheduled to take place on June 12 in Singapore.[237] In May 2017, Pence filed FEC paperwork to form Great America Committee, a PAC that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst.[238][239] This is the only time a vice president has started his own PAC while still in office.[240] Pence denied a New York Times article's allegations that he will run for president in 2020, calling them \"laughable and absurd\", and said the article was \"disgraceful and offensive\".[241] Pence is a key player in the Trump-Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry. After the inquiry was opened, Pence publicly stated his support of Trump's call for foreign investigation into 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden, saying, \"I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position.\"[242] House committees have requested information from Biden regarding the executive branch's dealings with Ukraine. Pence has had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Pence told the press that he did not mention Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption.[243] Pence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to assassinate Iran's General Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Queda attacks on the United States to Iran. In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani, \"an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans.\" Pence insisted Soleimani, \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States,\" which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers, who actually numbered 19, and insinuating without evidence, that the general was involved. Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated.[244] Pence's spokeswoman Katie Waldman said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, 10 of whom \"were assisted by Soleimani\".[245] In June 2019, the Democratic former New York City Council President Andrew Stein opined that Trump could improve his re-election chances by replacing Pence as his running mate with former South Carolina Governor and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.[246] Despite that, Trump has said Pence will be his running mate, but declined to endorse Pence in 2019 should his running mate seek to succeed him, but said he would give it \"very strong consideration\".[247] Pence is described as being staunchly conservative on fiscal and social issues, with his political views strongly shaped by his Christian faith and by the conservative political theorist Russell Kirk.[1] During his acceptance speech for the nomination of Republican vice presidential candidate at the 2016 Republican National Convention he said, \"I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\"[248] As one commentator put it, \"Pence doesn't simply wear his faith on his sleeve\u2014he wears the entire Jesus jersey.\"[16] Pence is an opponent of abortion, and his unwavering support of abortion restrictions has gained him the support of grassroots conservative activists.[249] He began seeking to defund Planned Parenthood in 2007[250] and in three congressional sessions, he introduced legislation to block organizations that provide abortion services from receiving any Title X funding, even for services not related to reproductive health or family planning.[251] Pence has criticized comprehensive sex education. In 2002, he criticized a speech by then-secretary of state Colin Powell, who had said it was \"important for young people\u00a0... to protect themselves from the possibility of acquiring any sexually transmitted disease\" through the use of condoms.[252][253] Pence called Powell's comments a \"sad day\" and expressed his support for abstinence education.[252][253] He asserted that \"condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases\" and that Powell was \"maybe inadvertently misleading millions of young people and endangering lives\".[252][253] Pence opposed President Obama's executive order eliminating restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research, saying, \"I believe it is morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for research\u00a0... I believe it is morally wrong to take the tax dollars of millions of pro-life Americans.\"[254][255] He asserted that \"scientific breakthroughs have rendered embryonic stem-cell research obsolete\".[254][255] On January 27, 2017, Pence spoke at the March for Life in Washington D.C., becoming the first vice president and the highest-ranking United States official to ever speak at the annual event.[256][257] Pence has said he supports an overturn of Roe v. Wade, though denying that Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for that purpose.[258][259] Pence has been a vocal opponent of efforts to expand LGBT civil rights, during both his governorship and his tenure as a U.S. representative. In 2000 he said, \"Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a 'discrete and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\"[260] Pence's 2000 congressional campaign website included text that called for \"an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus\" and instead advocated for resources to be directed toward institutions \"which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior\".[261][262][263][264] Pence has also been accused by LGBT rights advocates of endorsing conversion therapy, a charge he denies.[265] In 2007, Pence voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have banned workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[266] Pence opposed the 2009 Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act,[267] saying that Barack Obama wanted to \"advance a radical social agenda\"[268] and said that pastors \"could be charged or be subject to intimidation for simply expressing a Biblical worldview on the issue of homosexual behavior\".[269] Pence has said that homosexuals should not serve in the military, saying, \"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service because the presence of homosexuals in the ranks weakens unit cohesion.\"[270] Pence opposed the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" saying in 2010 that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military would \"have an impact on unit cohesion\".[270][271] Pence opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[272] While in the House, he said that \"societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family\".[273] He has advocated a constitutional same-sex marriage ban but did not champion such a proposed ban for his first year as governor.[274] Since entering politics, Pence has been widely condemned for his opposition to LGBT rights, by politicians, celebrities, and academics, who have accused Pence of promoting and encouraging homophobia and transphobia. Rolling Stone published an article in 2016 assailing Pence for his anti-LGBT and other actions as governor, and a book by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner condemned Pence as a \"Christian supremacist.\"[275][276] Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBT rights organization, has frequently censured Pence over his views on rights for the LGBT community, delivering a report in April 2018 that heavily excoriated Pence for his \"homophobic\" history.[277] Among the protests against Donald Trump, protesters have also targeted Pence; in May 2017, students at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, walked out of classes on the day of a speech delivered at the university by Pence, to protest Pence's anti-LGBT rhetoric.[278] In March 2018, Jill Twiss, a writer for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver wrote with Oliver a children's book about Pence's pet rabbit Marlon Bundo; the book's pro-LGBT themes and support of same-sex marriage were praised by LGBT rights groups and reviewers on Amazon, becoming a bestseller after it was published; the book aimed to disparage Pence for his anti-LGBT rhetoric, and spoofed Charlotte Pence's children's book about the rabbit following her father around on a day as vice president, Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President.[279][280] Pence's daughter Charlotte expressed her support for the parody book and the charities both books benefitted.[281] During the 2018 Winter Olympics held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, openly gay figure skater Adam Rippon declined an invitation to a meeting with Pence in Pyeongchang, citing Pence's anti-LGBT history and alleged support for conversion therapy.[282] When Pence was made aware of Rippon's statement, he published a response on Twitter calling the charge of supporting conversion therapy \"fake news.\"[283] John Oliver berated Pence for his hostility towards LGBT citizens and accused him of lying in his denials of supporting conversion therapy by pointing out Pence's longtime friendship with evangelist and anti-LGBT activist James Dobson, who promoted conversion therapy.[284] Following the tweet, the New York Times brought attention to a statement from Pence's campaign website in 2000: \"Resources should be directed towards those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\" The statement was interpreted as evidence of hypocrisy by Pence, which generated heavy criticism from the medical and LGBT community, though a Pence spokeswoman in January said the \"accusation is totally false\" citing that changing \u201csexual behavior\u201d referred to Pence\u2019s support of the Ryan White CARE Act which encourages safe sex practices to combat HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. [285][286] The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler has called the allegations that Pence supported conversion therapy as \"a dubious assumption\", while other media such as CNN promoted the allegations as truthful.[287] Pence's legislative history regarding LGBT rights has also come under political criticism. South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay, described Pence in August 2018 as \"a social extremist.\"[288] In June 2018, Pence visited Philadelphia. Prior to his arrival in the city, openly gay lawmaker Brian Sims, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 182nd district, posted a message and accompanying photo on Facebook of himself giving the middle finger to Pence, with the caption beneath the photo containing a statement denouncing Pence and his views on LGBT rights.[289] The posting of the image quickly drew controversy; while progressive commentators and media outlets lauded Sims for the message, right-wing and conservative sources were critical of Sims and the post, accusing him of lacking basic respect for the vice president; Sims responded on Twitter to the negative press by individually mocking detractors of the post and accusing them of supporting Donald Trump's alleged sexual assaults of women (which came to light following the release of a recording of Trump making obscene comments about women in 2016), and the controversial separations of immigrant families at the southern border conducted under the Trump administration.[289] Pence faced other protests and opposition during his visit to Philadelphia. In January 2019, Pence's wife, Second Lady Karen Pence announced that she would return to teaching at Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C. The announcement drew immediate controversy based on Immanuel Christian School's code of conduct, which included that the school would refuse admission to students who were involved in or who had tolerated \"sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity.\" After Second Lady Pence and the school were condemned by the media, Pence defended his wife, stating in an interview, \"To see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us.\" Pence was in turn condemned for the defense; on January 19, singer and LGBT activist Lady Gaga denounced the Pences and Immanuel Christian School at a concert in Las Vegas, stating that Pence believes \"it's acceptable that his wife works at a school that bans LGBTQ. You are wrong!\", among other related statements.[290][291][292] In March 2019, former Vice President Joe Biden referred to Pence as \"a decent guy\" during a speech at the University of Nebraska Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska, a month before Biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign. LGBT groups, progressive leaders and celebrities strongly criticized him, with actress and New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon chastising Biden on Twitter, to which Biden responded by apologizing and criticizing Pence's stance on LGBT rights. Nixon later penned an op-ed in The Washington Post calling Pence \"insidious and dangerous\" for his actions on LGBT rights, also condemning Pence's actions against abortion as Governor of Indiana and accusing the Vice President of continuing to support conversion therapy, writing that \"It's easy to say nice things about Pence when you're not personally threatened by his agenda. If Biden were being directly attacked in the same way that our community is, I think he would see Pence from a very different vantage point.\"[293][294] Pence was a co-sponsor of H.J.Res.73, a 2011 spending limit amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This amendment would limit federal spending to \"the average annual revenue collected in the three prior years, adjusted in proportion to changes in population and inflation\".[295] In regards to adopting the gold standard, Pence said in 2011, \"the time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nation's monetary affairs\".[296] Pence proposed legislation to end the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve (maximizing employment and stabilizing prices), requiring the Fed to just focus on price stability and not full employment.[297][298] He has been a proponent of a flat federal tax rate.[299] Pence opposed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) (the \"Wall Street bailout\") of 2008.[299] Pence also opposed the auto industry rescue package of 2008\u201309, which guided General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy.[300] In 2007, Pence voted against raising the federal minimum wage to $7.25 (from $5.15) an hour over two years, saying it would \"hurt the working poor\".[81] While in the House, Pence voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (\"card check\").[82] He voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[301] He had publicly opposed the bill[302] denouncing it as a failure, and called for a federal spending freeze.[303] Nevertheless, several months after voting against the bill, Pence privately sought $6\u00a0million in stimulus funds for projects in his district,[304] and in 2010, hosted a job fair for stimulus-backed employers.[305] A Pence spokesperson said that \"once it became law, he had a responsibility to support local efforts to secure funding for projects that could benefit people in his district\".[304] Pence voted against the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.[306] Pence was a supporter of earmark reform. He voted against the $139.7\u00a0billion Transportation-Treasury spending bill in June 2006, and in favor of a series of amendments proposed that same month by Jeff Flake which would strip other members' earmarks from the federal budget.[307] On occasion, however, Pence secured earmarks for projects in his district.[307] Pence voted against the act that created Medicare Part\u00a0D (a prescription drug benefit)[42] and against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[308] In June 2012, after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius, Pence likened the ruling to the September 11 terrorist attacks in a closed-door meeting of the House Republican Conference. He immediately apologized for making the statement.[309] In 2001, Pence wrote an op-ed arguing against the tobacco settlement and tobacco regulation, saying they would create \"new government bureaucracies\" and encroach on private lives. He said that \"despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill\".[121][310] Pence asserted, \"two out of every three smokers does [sic] not die from a smoking related illness and nine out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer\", while acknowledging that \"smoking isn't good for you\" and people who smoke should quit.[121][310] In 2009, Pence voted against the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which allows the FDA to regulate tobacco products.[311] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pence's state of Indiana has one of the worst smoking problems in America.[254] Pence was slow to support a needle exchange program in Indiana to combat an HIV outbreak related to needle-sharing among opioid drug users. While giving credit for the program's ultimate start, an AIDS research foundation director of public policy later deemed the outbreak \"entirely preventable\". The state's health commissioner defended Pence's speed at responding to the situation.[312] In June 2006, Pence unveiled an immigration plan (which he described as \"No Amnesty Immigration reform\") that would include increased border security, followed by strict enforcement of laws against hiring illegal aliens, and a guest worker program. This guest worker program would have required participants to apply from their home country to government-approved job placement agencies that match workers with employers who cannot find Americans for the job.[313] The plan received support from conservatives such as Dick Armey,[314] but attracted criticism from other conservatives such as Richard Viguerie and paleoconservatives Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Buchanan, who, as described by The New York Times, collectively viewed Pence as lending \"his conservative prestige to a form of liberal amnesty\".[14][315] In 2009, Pence opposed birthright citizenship (the legal principle set forth by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\"). He co-sponsored a bill that would have limited citizenship to children born to at least one parent who is a citizen, immigrants living permanently in the U.S. or non-citizens performing active service in the Armed Forces.[316] In 2010, Pence voted against the DREAM Act, which would grant the undocumented children of illegal immigrants conditional non-immigrant status if they met certain requirements.[317] In 2010, Pence said Arizona S.B. 1070, which at the time of passage in 2010 was the nation's broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration legislation, was \"a good faith to try and restore order to their communities\".[318] Pence supported President George W. Bush's unsuccessful 2005 proposal to partially privatize Social Security[319] by allowing workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in private investment accounts and reduce the increase in benefits for high-income participants.[320] Pence had previously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush's.[320] When asked in 2010 if he would be willing to make cuts to Social Security, Pence answered, \"I think everything has to be on the table.\"[320] When asked if he would raise the retirement age, he said, \"I'm an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu.\"[320] Pence supported the Patriot Act on its passage in 2001,[321] and in 2005 called the act \"essential to our continued success in the war on terror here at home\".[322] Pence was a sponsor of legislation in 2009 to extend three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act (the library records provision, the roving-wiretap provision, and the lone-wolf provision) for an additional ten years.[323] Pence \"has been a longtime, aggressive advocate of trade deals\" between the U.S. and foreign countries.[324] Pence has been a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),[324] and during his tenure in the House, he voted for every free-trade agreement that came before him.[325] Pence voted in favor of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); in favor of keeping the U.S. in the World Trade Organization; and in favor of permanent normal trade relations with China.[325] Pence also supported bilateral free-trade agreements with Colombia, South Korea, Panama, Peru, Oman, Chile and Singapore.[325] Pence's strong stance in favor of free trade sharply differs from the stance of his running mate Trump, who has condemned globalization and the liberalization of trade.[324][325] Pence voted against the Trade and Globalization Act of 2007, which would have expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance to American workers adversely affected by globalization.[326] However, in 2014 Pence called for the \"swift adoption\" of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), urging Indiana's congressional delegation to support the trade deal.[324] Pence supported the Iraq War Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq.[327] During the Iraq War, Pence opposed setting a public withdrawal date from Iraq. During an April 2007 visit to Baghdad, Pence and John McCain visited Shorja market, the site of a deadly attack in February 2007 which had claimed 61 lives. Pence and McCain described the visit as evidence that the security situation in Iraqi markets had improved.[328] The visit to the market took place under tight security, including helicopters overhead, and the New York Times reported that the visit gave a false indication of how secure the area was because of the extremely heavy security forces protecting McCain.[329] Pence chaired the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and was a prominent supporter of George W. Bush's Iraq War troop surge of 2007. At the time, Pence said \"the surge is working\" and defended the initial decision to invade in 2003.[327] Pence has opposed closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and trying the suspected terrorists in the United States.[330] As an alternative, Pence has said the \"enemy combatants\" should be tried in a military tribunal.[330] Pence has stated his support of Israel and its right to attack facilities in Iran to prevent the Iranians from developing nuclear weapons, has defended the actions of Israel in its use of deadly force in enforcing the blockade of Gaza, and has referred to Israel as \"America's most cherished ally\".[331] He visited Israel in 2014 to express his support, and in 2016 signed into law a bill which would ban Indiana from having any commercial dealings with a company that boycotts Israel.[332] He opposes a Palestinian state.[333] Pence criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama's alleged weak leadership, saying: \"When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts. That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership.\"[334] Two weeks prior to the NATO intervention in Libya, Pence thanked the Obama administration and secretary of state Hillary Clinton for their efforts to isolate the Gaddafi regime.[335][336][337] Pence expressed support for \"a no-fly zone\" and said \"Gaddafi must go.\"[335][336][337] Pence condemned the \"terrible savagery\" against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, saying \"The images of the violence and its victims have shocked the American people, and decent people all over the world\".[338] Pence called on Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to release Andrew Brunson, an American pastor detained in the post-coup purges in Turkey,[339] or face significant sanctions.[340] On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on two senior Turkish government ministers who were involved in the detention of Brunson.[341][342] Erdo\u011fan said the U.S. behavior will force Turkey to look for new friends and allies.[343] On July 26, 2018, Pence raised the Xinjiang re-education camps issue at Ministerial To Advance Religious Freedom.[344] He said that \"Sadly, as we speak as well, Beijing is holding hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of Uyghur Muslims in so-called 're-education camps', where they're forced to endure around-the-clock political indoctrination and to denounce their religious beliefs and their cultural identity as the goal.\"[345] Pence \"does not accept the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of climate change.\"[346] In 2001, Pence wrote in an op-ed that \"global warming is a myth,\" saying that \"the earth is actually cooler today than it was about 50 years ago\".[347][348] In 2006 and 2009, Pence expressed the view that it was unclear whether global warming was driven by human activity, and in 2009 he told political commentator Chris Matthews that there was a \"growing skepticism in the scientific community about global warming\".[349][350] In 2009, Pence led the Republican effort to defeat the American Clean Energy and Security Act (Waxman-Markey), a Democratic-backed bill to cut greenhouse gas emissions (and therefore combat climate change) through a cap-and-trade system.[346] On September 27, 2016, however, Pence said \"there's no question\" that human activity affects both the climate and the environment.[351] Pence holds a lifetime rating of four percent from the League of Conservation Voters.[352] While in the House, Pence \"voted to eliminate funding for climate education programs and to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions\".[108] Pence also \"repeatedly voted against energy efficiency and renewable energy funding and rules\" and voted \"for several bills that supported fossil fuel development, including legislation promoting offshore drilling\".[108] Pence has questioned proposals to decrease penalties for low-level marijuana offenses in Indiana, saying the state should focus on \"reducing crime, not reducing penalties\".[353] In 2013, Pence expressed concern that a then-pending bill to revise the state's criminal code was not tough enough on drug crimes, and successfully lobbied to limit the reduction in sentencing of marijuana offenses.[354] In 2016, he signed into law a measure that would reinstate a ten-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for certain drug offenders.[355][356] During 2014, Pence sent a letter to United States Attorney General Eric Holder, saying Indiana would not comply with federal prison rape elimination standards because they were \"too expensive\". According to the Indiana Department of Corrections, it would cost the state $15\u201320\u00a0million annually to comply with the guidelines. Pence said a number of rape prevention measures had already been \"implemented\".[357] In 2015, Pence signed Senate Bill 94 to lengthen the statute of limitations for rape\u2014continuing for five years after sufficient DNA evidence is uncovered, enough recorded evidence is brought forth or discovered, or the offender confesses to the crime.[358] Pence also signed Senate Bill\u00a08 to allow the death penalty for beheadings if the victim was alive at the time of the offense.[358]Pence has been an advocate of federal restrictions on online gambling. In 2006, he was one of 35 cosponsors of H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte\u2013Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,[359] and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[360] Pence praised the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission when it was announced. Pence said: Freedom won today in the Supreme Court. Today's ruling in the Citizens United case takes us one step closer to the Founding Fathers' vision of free speech, a vision that is cherished by all Americans and one Congress has a responsibility to protect. If the freedom of speech means anything, it means protecting the right of private citizens to voice opposition or support for their elected representatives. The fact that the court overturned a 20-year precedent speaks volumes about the importance of this issue.[361]Pence described the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, known as McCain\u2013Feingold, which regulates the financing of political campaigns, as \"oppressive restrictions on free speech\".[362] In the late 1990s, Pence put forth support for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton due to lying about an affair Clinton had as president, but also further argued for the moral requirements of the office of the presidency. Pence wrote that an American president with \"bad moral habits\" can \"incinerate the planet\", thus nothing less than a president who represents \"all of our highest hopes and ideals and values\" could be accepted. Pence also brought up \"staggering rates of illegitimacy and divorce\" mandating that \"America needs to be able to look to her First Family as role models\".[363][364] After becoming vice president, Pence remained mostly silent on allegations that President Trump had extramarital affairs before his presidency with adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, but on one occasion called Daniels' allegations \"baseless\".[363][364] Mike and Karen Pence have been married since 1985. The two met while he was in law school at Indiana University.[16] They have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.[365][366] During Pence's service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses.[11][20] Pence's son, Michael, is a first lieutenant and training to be a pilot in the United States Marine Corps.[367][368] Pence has five siblings. His oldest brother, Greg, ran in 2018 to represent Indiana's 6th congressional district in Congress (the seat previously held by Mike), and won.[369][370] Pence's father died in 1988, leaving his mother, Nancy, a widow with four grown children and two teenagers. On May 1, 2004, Pence's mother married Basil Coolidge Fritsch, a widower since 2001.[371][372] The Pences have four pets: a cat, a dog, a rabbit, and a snake.[373] Their rabbit, named Marlon Bundo, was featured in two children's books, both released in March 2018. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was written by Jill Twiss and released on March 18, 2018.[374] Marlon Bundo's: A Day in the Life of the Vice President was written by Charlotte and released on March 19, 2018.[375] Pence was raised in a Catholic family, served as an altar server, and attended parochial school.[4][376] He became a born-again Christian in college, while a member of a nondenominational Christian student group, and identified his first year\u2014and specifically \"a Christian music festival in Asbury, Kentucky, in the spring of 1978\"[377] referring to the Ichthus Music Festival at then Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky\u2014as the moment he made a \"commitment to Christ.\"[4][376] After that point, Pence continued to attend Mass (where he met his wife) and was a Catholic youth minister.[376] Pence called himself Catholic in a 1994 news piece, although by 1995, he and his family had joined an evangelical megachurch, the Grace Evangelical Church.[4][376] In 2013, Pence said his family was \"kind of looking for a church.\"[4] He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\" and as \"a born-again, evangelical Catholic.\"[4][376] When asked by Chris Matthews in 2009 if he believed in evolution, Pence said \"I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them. How he did that, I'll ask him about some day.\"[254][349] In a 2002 statement on the floor of the House of Representatives (reported in the Congressional Record), Pence told his colleagues \"...\u00a0I also believe that someday scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides even a remotely rational explanation for the known universe.\"[378][379] Pence adheres to the Billy Graham rule, in which husbands avoid spending time alone with women to whom they are not married.[380][381] *\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.",

He previously was the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017 and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. He is the younger brother of U.S. Representative Greg Pence.\nBorn and raised in Columbus, Indiana, Pence graduated from Hanover College and earned a law degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law before entering private practice. After losing two bids for a U.S. congressional seat in 1988 and 1990, he became a conservative radio and television talk show host from 1994 to 1999. Pence was elected to the United States Congress in 2000 and represented Indiana's 2nd congressional district and Indiana's 6th congressional district in the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. He served as the chairman of the House Republican Conference from 2009 to 2011.[2] Pence described himself as a \"principled conservative\" and supporter of the Tea Party movement,[3] stating that he was \"a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\"[4]\nPence successfully sought the Republican nomination for the 2012 Indiana gubernatorial election when term-limited Mitch Daniels retired. He defeated former speaker John R. Gregg in the closest gubernatorial election in 50 years.[5][6] Upon becoming governor in January 2013, Pence initiated the largest tax cut in Indiana's history and pushed for more funding for education initiatives. Pence signed bills intended to restrict abortions, including one that prohibited abortions if the reason for the procedure was the fetus's race, gender, or disability.[7] After Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), he encountered fierce resistance from moderate members of his party, the business community, and LGBT advocates. The backlash against the RFRA led Pence to amend the bill to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and other criteria.\nPence was inaugurated as vice president of the United States on January 20, 2017. He had withdrawn his gubernatorial reelection campaign in July to become the running mate of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who went on to win the presidential election on November 8, 2016.\nMichael Richard Pence was born June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Nancy Jane (n\u00e9e Cawley) and Edward Joseph Pence Jr.,[8][9] who ran a group of gas stations.[10][11] His father served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph.[12] His maternal family were Irish Catholic Democrats.[13] Pence was named after his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from County Sligo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island, following an aunt and his brother James, and became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois.[14][15][16][17] His maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare.[18][19]\nPence graduated from Columbus North High School in 1977. He earned a BA degree in history from Hanover College in 1981, and a JD degree from the Indiana University's Robert H. McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis in 1986.[20] While at Hanover, Pence joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, where he became the chapter president.[21] After graduating from Hanover, Pence was an admissions counselor at the college from 1981 to 1983.[22]\nIn his childhood and early adulthood, Pence was a Roman Catholic and a Democrat. He volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party in 1976 and voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election,[1][16] and has said he was originally inspired to get involved in politics by people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.[1] While in college, Pence became an evangelical, born-again Christian, to the great disappointment of his mother.[1][16] His political views also started shifting to the right during this time in his life, something which Pence attributes to the \"common-sense conservatism of Ronald Reagan\" with which he began to identify.[1][23]\nAfter graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice.[24] He ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in 1988 and in 1990. In 1991, he became the president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a self-described free-market think tank and a member of the State Policy Network, a position he held until 1993.[25][26][27]\nShortly after his first congressional campaign in 1988, radio station WRCR-FM in Rushville, Indiana, hired Pence to host a weekly half-hour radio show, Washington Update with Mike Pence.[28] In 1992, Pence began hosting a daily talk show on WRCR, The Mike Pence Show, in addition to a Saturday show on WNDE in Indianapolis.[25][28][29][30] Pence called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\" since he considered himself politically conservative while not as bombastic as Limbaugh.[31][32] Beginning on April 11, 1994, Network Indiana syndicated The Mike Pence Show statewide.[33] With a 9:00\u00a0a.m. to noon (ET) time slot, the program reached as many as 18 radio stations in Indiana, including WIBC in Indianapolis.[25] Pence ended his radio show in September 1999 to focus on his 2000 campaign for Congress, which he eventually won.[34] From 1995 to 1999, Pence hosted a weekend public affairs TV show also titled The Mike Pence Show on Indianapolis TV station WNDY.[28][35]\nIn 1988, Pence ran for Congress against Democratic incumbent Philip Sharp, but lost.[36] He ran against Sharp again in 1990, quitting his job in order to work full-time in the campaign, but once again was unsuccessful.[36] During the race, Pence used \"political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife.\"[37] While the spending was not illegal at the time, it reportedly undermined his campaign.[37]\nDuring the 1990 campaign, Pence ran a television advertisement in which an actor, dressed in a robe and headdress and speaking in a thick Middle Eastern accent, thanked his opponent, Sharp, for doing nothing to wean the United States off imported oil as chairman of a House subcommittee on energy and power.[37][38] In response to criticism, Pence's campaign responded that the ad was not about Arabs; rather, it concerned Sharp's lack of leadership.[37][38] In 1991, Pence wrote an essay, \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner\", published in the Indiana Policy Review, in which he apologized for running negative ads against Sharp.[31][37][39]\nMike Pence rejuvenated his political career by running for the U.S. House of Representatives again in 2000, this time winning the seat in Indiana's 2nd congressional district after six-year incumbent David M. McIntosh opted to run for governor of Indiana. The district (renumbered as Indiana's 6th congressional district beginning in 2002) comprises all or portions of 19 counties in eastern Indiana. As a congressman, Pence adopted the slogan he had used on the radio, describing himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\"[4] While in Congress, Pence belonged to the Tea Party Caucus.[40]\nIn his first year in office, Pence opposed President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act in 2001,[41] as well as President Bush's Medicare prescription drug expansion the following year.[42] Pence was re-elected four more times by comfortable margins. In the 2006, 2008, and 2010 House elections, he defeated Democrat Barry Welsh.[43][44][45]\nPence began to climb the party leadership structure and from 2005 to 2007 was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House Republicans.[46] In November 2006, Pence announced his candidacy for leader of the Republican Party (minority leader) in the United States House of Representatives.[47] Pence's release announcing his run for minority leader focused on a \"return to the values\" of the Newt Gingrich-headed 1994 Republican Revolution.[47] However, he lost the bid to Representative John Boehner of Ohio by a vote of 168 for Boehner, 27 for Pence, and one for Representative Joe Barton of Texas.[48] In January 2009, Pence was elected as the Republican Conference chairman, the third-highest-ranking Republican leadership position. He ran unopposed and was elected unanimously. He was the first representative from Indiana to hold a House leadership position since 1981.[2] During Pence's twelve years in the House, he introduced 90 bills and resolutions; none became law.[49] His committee assignments in the House were the following:\nIn 2008, Esquire magazine listed Pence as one of the ten best members of Congress, writing that Pence's \"unalloyed traditional conservatism has repeatedly pitted him against his party elders.\"[56] Pence was mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for president in 2008[57] and 2012.[58] In September 2010, he was the top choice for president in a straw poll conducted by the Values Voter Summit.[59][60] That same year he was encouraged to run against incumbent Democratic senator Evan Bayh,[61][62][63] but opted not to enter the race,[64] even after Bayh unexpectedly announced that he would retire.[65]\nIn May 2011, Mike Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012.[66] Incumbent Republican governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited. He ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels.[67][68] Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote and less than 3% ahead of Democrat John R. Gregg, and trailed by Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham.[69] Pence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013.[70]\nPence \"inherited a $2\u00a0billion budget reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state\u00a0... added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections.\"[71] The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2\u00a0billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14\u00a0billion annual state budget include $24\u00a0million cut from colleges and universities; $27\u00a0million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA);[72] and $12\u00a0million cut from the Department of Correction.[73] During Pence's term as governor, the unemployment rate reflected the national average.[74] Indiana's job growth lagged slightly behind the national trend.[75] In 2014, Indiana's economy was among the slowest-growing in the United States, with 0.4 percent GDP growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector.[76] Carrier Corp. and United Technologies Electronic Controls (UTEC) announced in 2016 that they would be closing two facilities in Indiana, sending 2,100 jobs to Mexico; the Trump campaign criticized the moves[77] and Pence expressed \"deep disappointment\".[78][79] Pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received.[79][80] The Indiana Economic Development Corporation led by Pence had approved $24\u00a0million in incentives to 10 companies who sent jobs abroad. $8.7\u00a0million had been paid out by August 2016.[77]\nIn 2013, Pence signed a law blocking local governments in Indiana from requiring businesses to offer higher wages or benefits beyond those required by federal law. In 2015, Pence also repealed an Indiana law that required construction companies working on publicly funded projects to pay a prevailing wage.[81][82][83][84] Indiana enacted right-to-work legislation under Pence's predecessor, Republican governor Mitch Daniels. Under Pence, the state successfully defended this legislation against a labor challenge.[82] In 2013, Pence also announced the formation of the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, a life sciences research facility supported with $25\u00a0million in startup funds from the state.[85]\nPence made tax reform, namely a 10 percent income-tax rate cut, a priority for 2013.[86][87] While he did not get the 10 percent cut he advocated, Pence did accomplish his goal of cutting state taxes.[86] Legislators cut the income tax by five percent and also killed the inheritance tax.[86] Speaker of the House Brian Bosma said the legislative package was the \"largest tax cut in our state's history, about $1.1\u00a0billion dollars.\"[88] By signing Senate Bill 1, the state corporate income tax would be dropped from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent by 2021, which would be the second-lowest corporate income tax in the nation.[89] The law also permitted Indiana counties to eliminate the business personal property tax on new equipment and let them exempt small businesses with less than $20,000 worth of equipment from paying personal property taxes.[89]\nOn June 12, 2013, the Indiana Legislature overrode Pence's veto of a bill to retroactively authorize a local tax. Lawmakers overrode Pence's veto in a 68\u201323 vote in the House and a 34\u201312 one in the Senate.[90] Republican legislators overwhelmingly voted against Pence, while most Democrats supported his veto.[91] The Jackson\u2013Pulaski tax fix, one of three bills vetoed by Pence during the session, addressed a 15-year-old county income tax which had been imposed to fund the construction of jail facilities with the stipulation that the tax be lowered by one percent after the first several years. The reduction was not implemented and thus county residents paid an additional one percent tax that they were legally not required to pay. The bill, which was passed by a huge majority of legislators and subsequently vetoed by Pence, allowed money to be kept and not returned to the taxpayers as would have otherwise been necessary.[91][92]\nAs governor, Pence pressed for a balanced budget amendment to the state's constitution. He initially proposed the initiative in his State of the State address in January 2015. The legislation passed the state Senate.[93] Indiana has had AAA credit ratings with the three major credit-rating agencies since 2010, before Pence took office; these ratings were maintained throughout Pence's tenure.[94]\nIn 2014, Pence supported the Indiana Gateway project,[95] a $71.4\u00a0million passenger and freight rail improvement initiative paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus package), which Pence had voted against while a congressman.[96] In October 2015, Pence \"announced plans to pay off a $250\u00a0million federal loan\" to cover unemployment insurance payments which had spiked during the recession.[71] In March 2016, Pence signed legislation to fund a $230\u00a0million two-year road-funding package.[71]\nDuring his tenure as governor, Pence supported significant increases in education funding to pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, but frequently clashed with supporters of traditional public schools.[97][98] In 2014, a little over one year after taking office, Pence helped establish a $10\u00a0million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans (several of whom opposed the proposal) to approve the plan.[97][98] Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, \"getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool.\"[98] Demand for enrollment in the program \"far outstripped\" capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80\u00a0million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding,[97] arguing that \"Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion.\"[99] After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds.[97][100]\nIn 2015, Pence secured significant increases in charter-school funding from the legislation, although he did not get everything he had proposed.[98] Legislation signed into law by Pence in 2013 greatly increased the number of students in Indiana who qualify for school vouchers, making it one of the largest voucher programs in the United States.[101][102][103][104] The annual cost of the program is estimated to be $53\u00a0million for the 2015\u201316 school year.[103][104]\nPence opposed the Common Core State Standards Initiative, calling for the repeal of the standards in his 2014 State of the State address. The Indiana General Assembly then passed a bill to repeal the standards, becoming the first state to do so.[97][98]\nDespite successful advocacy for more funding for pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, Pence has frequently clashed with teachers unions and supporters of public schooling.[97][98] In one of his first acts as governor, Pence removed control of the Educational Employment Relations Board, which was in charge of handling conflicts between unions and school boards, from Glenda Ritz, a Democrat who was the Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction (a separately elected position in the state).[105] Pence created a new \"Center for Education and Career Innovation\" (CECI) to coordinate efforts between schools and the private sector; Ritz opposed the Center, viewing it as a \"power grab\" and encroachment on her own duties. Pence eventually disestablished the Center in order to help defuse the conflict.[97][98] In May 2015, Pence signed a bill stripping Ritz of much of her authority over standardized testing and other education issues, and reconstituting the State Board of Education dominated by Pence appointees.[106] The bill also allowed the board to appoint a chairman other than the Superintendent of Public Instruction starting in 2017, and added the State Board of Education (controlled by Pence) as a \"state educational authority\" along with the Department of Education (controlled by Ritz) for purposes of accessing sensitive student data.[106] Pence and Ritz also clashed over non-binding federal guidelines that advised Indiana public schools must treat transgender students in a way that corresponds to their gender identity, even if their education files indicate a different gender.[107]\nDuring Pence's term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly \"repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana's energy efficiency efforts.\"[108] Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that \"Indiana is a pro-coal state,\" expressing support for an \"all-of-the-above energy strategy,\" and stating: \"we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the EPA until we bring their war on coal to an end.\"[108][109] In 2015, Pence sent a letter to President Obama denouncing the EPA's Clean Power Plan (which would regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants) and stating that Indiana would refuse to comply with the plan.[108][110] Indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan.[108] In 2016, Pence said that even if legal challenges failed, Indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions.[111]\nIn 2014, over the opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property.[112] In 2015, following a shooting in Chattanooga, Pence recruited the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard on concealed carry. Some National Guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue.[113] In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary's still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns.[114][115] The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to Indiana, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana Attorney General Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as \"an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government.\"[115] In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer in Indiana.[116]\nIn 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a Superfund site. Governor Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency;[117] his successor Governor Eric Holcomb has issued Executive Order 17-13, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago.[118][119] The site of several former lead smelting plants was first identified as a health concern by the EPA in 1997.[120]\nBeginning in December 2014, there was an HIV outbreak in Southern Indiana.[121] In 2011, Planned Parenthood ran five rural clinics in Indiana. They tested for HIV and offered prevention, intervention and counseling for better health. The one in Scott County performed no abortions.[122] The Republican-controlled legislature and Pence defunded Planned Parenthood.[123] Scott County has been without an HIV testing center since 2013.[122] Pence had long been a vocal opponent of needle exchange programs, which allow drug users to trade in used syringes for sterile ones in order to stop the spread of diseases, despite evidence that such programs prevent the spread of AIDS and hepatitis C, and do not increase drug abuse.[121]\nIn March 2015, after the outbreak began, Pence allowed at least five counties to open needle exchanges, but did not move to lift the state ban on funding for needle exchanges.[121] Critics say Pence's compromise has been ineffective because counties had no way to pay for needle exchanges themselves. Indiana State Health Commissioner Jerome Adams defended Pence, saying that publicly funded needle exchange programs are controversial in many conservative communities.[124]\nIn 2015, Pence and the Obama administration agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.[125][126] As part of the expansion, called the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, Pence negotiated modifications to the program for Indiana that included co-payments by participants. The co-payments are linked to healthy behaviors on the part of the participants so that, for example, a participant who quit smoking would receive a lower co-payment. Participants can lose benefits for failing to make the payments.[127] The required contribution would be about 2% of income. Critics say those who already struggle to buy food and housing will have even more difficulty paying their 2%. One critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. A service provider said the program \"wins the award for bureaucratic complexity and red tape.\"[128] In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. National Public Radio/Side Effects Public Media said the application used \"misleading and inaccurate information.\"[129]\nOn March 26, 2015, Pence signed Indiana Senate Bill 101, also known as the Indiana \"religious objections\" bill (Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA), into law.[130] The law's signing was met with criticism by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons.[131][132][133][134] Such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ spoke out against the law. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff condemned the law, with Salesforce.com saying it would halt its plans to expand in the state.[135][136] Angie's List announced that they would cancel a $40\u00a0million expansion of their Indianapolis based headquarters over concerns with the law. The expansion would have moved 1000 jobs into the state.[137] Thousands protested against the policy.[131] Five Republican state representatives voted against the bill, and Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, criticized it as sending the \"wrong signal\" about the state.[138]\nPence defended the law, saying it was not about discrimination. In an appearance on the ABC News program This Week with George Stephanopoulos[139] he said, \"We are not going to change this law,\" while refusing to answer whether examples of discrimination against LGBT people given by Eric Miller of anti-LGBT group Advance America would be legal under the law.[140] Pence denied the law permitted discrimination and wrote in a March 31, 2015, Wall Street Journal op-ed, \"If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn't eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it.\"[141] In the wake of the backlash against the RFRA, on April 2, 2015, Pence signed legislation revising the law to protect against potential discrimination.[142] Pence received heavy criticism from liberals at the time of signing the religious freedom law, who labeled him as anti-gay. In 2018, emails released to the Associated Press showed that conservatives had also opposed his changing the law.[143]\nIn March 2016, Pence, as Indiana governor, signed into law H.B. 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. The bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus' race or gender or a fetal abnormality. In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state.[144][145][146] The law was described as \"exceptional for its breadth\"; if implemented, it would have made Indiana \"the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome.\"[145] Days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial.[145] The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by United States 7th Circuit.[147]\nIn June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he apologized.[148]\nOn January 26, 2015, it was widely reported that Pence had planned to launch a state-run, taxpayer-funded news service for Indiana.[149] The service, called \"JustIN\", was to be overseen by a former reporter for The Indianapolis Star, and would feature breaking news, stories written by press secretaries, and light features.[149] At the time, it was reported that the two employees who would run the news service would be paid a combined $100,000 yearly salary.[149] The target audience was small newspapers which had limited staff, but the site would also serve to communicate directly with the public. The publisher of the Commercial Review of Portland, Indiana, said, \"I think it's a ludicrous idea\u00a0... the notion of elected officials presenting material that will inevitably have a pro-administration point of view is antithetical to the idea of an independent press.\"[149] There was speculation that the news service would publish pro-administration stories that would make Pence look good in the event of a presidential run.[150]\nAccording to Associated Press, the idea \"of stories prewritten for the media set off a wave of criticism from journalists around the country, who likened the Indiana endeavor to state-run media in Russia and China. Headlines like 'Pravda in the Plains' accompanied calls for Pence to scrap the idea.\"[151] David A. Graham of The Atlantic regarded the announcement of JustIN as evidence of a disturbing changing trend in how the public gets news.[152] After a week or so of controversy about the idea, Pence scrapped the idea saying, \"However well-intentioned, after thorough review of the preliminary planning and careful consideration of the concerns expressed, I am writing you to inform you that I have made a decision to terminate development of the JustIN website immediately.\"[153]\nAs governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana.[154] In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence's order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence has appealed.[154]\nIn December 2015, Pence said that \"calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional\".[155]\nPence \"repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright.\"[156][157][158] As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records. In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence's contacts.[159] While this use is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues.[160] In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure.[160] Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence's use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence's past attacks on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state.[160] In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence's personal AOL account email correspondence.[156]\nPence ran for a second term as governor. He was unopposed in the May 3, 2016, Republican primary for governor. He was to face Democrat John R. Gregg, former speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, in a rematch of the 2012 race. However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate.[161] Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence's place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate.[162][163] Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election.[164]\nPence endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.[57]\nDonald Trump considered naming Pence as his vice presidential running mate along with other finalists including New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich.[165] Pence had stronger connections at the time to the politically influential big donors, the Kochs, than Trump did.[166][167][168][169][170] As was widely reported on July 14, The Indianapolis Star wrote that Pence would end his re-election campaign and accept the Republican vice presidential nomination instead.[171] The following day, Trump officially announced on Twitter that Pence would be his running mate.[172][173][174]\nImmediately after the announcement, Pence said he was \"very supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States\".[175] Pence said he was \"absolutely\" in sync with Trump's Mexican wall proposal, stating that Mexico was \"absolutely\" going to pay for it.[176]\nAccording to a FiveThirtyEight rating of candidates' ideology, Pence was the most conservative vice-presidential candidate in the last forty years.[177]\nPence said his role model as vice president would be Dick Cheney.[178]\nDuring Pence's preparations for the vice presidential debate in October 2016, Scott Walker played the role of Tim Kaine.[179] (In Kaine's own debate prep, Robert Barnett was selected to play Pence.)[180]\nIn response to lewd comments made by Donald Trump in 2005,[181] and reported in The Washington Post on Friday, October 7, 2016, Pence said \"I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them\", but Pence made clear that he was standing by the presidential candidate.[182] The candidate's campaign substituted Pence for Trump at a campaign event from which Trump was \"uninvited\" by Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives.[183]\nAccording to The New York Times, Pence called Trump on October 8, 2016, and told him he would not appear at the campaign event with Ryan as a replacement for Trump and that Trump would need to handle the next 48 hours on his own, as Pence said he did not think he would be an effective surrogate for Trump.[184] On October 10, 2016, Pence appeared on CNN and said it was \"absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket\" and that it is the \"greatest honor of my life\" to be nominated as Trump's running mate.[185]\nAccording to Bob Woodward's 2018 book Fear: Trump in the White House, in the midst of the Access Hollywood tape scandal in October 2016, then Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told Trump he should drop out of the race for the good of the party and that Pence had agreed to replace Trump on the top of the ticket as the Republican presidential nominee and that former United States secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had agreed to be Pence's running mate.[186]\nOn October 27, 2016, a chartered Boeing 737 carrying Pence skidded off a runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York City and was slowed by an engineered materials arrestor system; no injuries were reported.[187]\nOn November 8, 2016, Pence was elected vice president of the United States as Trump's running mate.\nSoon after the election, he was appointed chairman of President-elect Trump's transition team.[188] During the transition phase of the Trump administration, Pence was reported as holding a large degree of influence in the administration due to his roles as a mediator between Trump and congressional Republicans, for reassuring conservatives about Trump's conservative credentials, and his influence in determining Donald Trump's cabinet.[189][190]\nPence is the sixth vice president from Indiana, following Schuyler Colfax (1869\u20131873), Thomas A. Hendricks (1885), Charles W. Fairbanks (1905\u20131909), Thomas R. Marshall (1913\u20131921) and Dan Quayle (1989\u20131993).\nOn January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence became the 48th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by justice Clarence Thomas, using Ronald Reagan's Bible, opened to 2 Chronicles 7:14, \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land\", which is the same verse Reagan used for his swearing-ins as governor and president. Pence also used his personal Bible which he opens every morning.[191]\nOn the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security.[192] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017.[193]\nPence also sat in on calls made by President Trump to foreign heads of government and state such as Russian president Vladimir Putin[194] and Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.[195][196]\nIn January, Pence appointed Josh Pitcock as his chief of staff, who he had known from his gubernatorial and congressional days.[197] The following month, Jarrod Agen was tapped as deputy assistant to the president and director of communications to the vice president; his previous job being chief of staff for governor of Michigan Rick Snyder through the time of the Flint water crisis.[198] In July, Pitcock stepped down as chief of staff, and was succeeded in the position by Nick Ayers, another longtime Pence advisor.[199]\nOn February 7, 2017, Pence, in his dual constitutional role as president of the United States Senate made the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member.[200][201] He cast the deciding vote to break a fifty-fifty tie to confirm Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education.[202] Pence cast his second tie-breaking vote on March 30, voting to advance a bill to defund Planned Parenthood.[203] In 2018, Pence broke a tie to confirm Jonathan A. Kobes for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This was the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a judicial nominee in U.S. history. As of 2019[update], Pence has cast 13 tie-breaking votes, seventh-most in history and more than his previous four predecessors (Joe Biden, Dick Cheney, Al Gore and Dan Quayle) cast combined (Cheney broke eight ties, Gore broke four ties, and Quayle and Biden did not cast a tie-breaking vote).\nIn April, Pence made a tour of the Asia-Pacific region. In South Korea, he met acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn and condemned North Korea's latest missile launch.[204][205][205][206] In Japan, Pence met Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe and pledged to work with Japan, South Korea, and China \"to achieve a peaceable resolution and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\" adding \"The era of strategic patience is over and while all options are on the table\".[207][208] Pence subsequently traveled to Jakarta, Indonesia, where he met with president Joko Widodo, toured the largest mosque in the region (the Istiqlal Mosque), and praised moderate Islam.[209][210] Pence ended his trip with stops in Sydney, Australia (where, after meeting with Malcolm Turnbull, he said the U.S. \"intends to honor\" a U.S.\u2013Australia refugee resettlement agreement),[211] and Oahu, Hawaii and American Samoa.[212]\nOn May 21, 2017, Pence delivered the commencement address at the University of Notre Dame. Traditionally, the president delivers the address at Notre Dame in his inaugural year, but in 2017 Pence was invited instead when Trump decided to speak at Liberty University.[213][214][215][216]\nOn October 8, 2017, Pence walked out of a game between the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers at Trump's request after members of the 49ers knelt during the national anthem. Shortly afterwards, Pence commented via Twitter, \"President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem\"; further adding, \"While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I don't think its too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag and our national anthem.\"[217] Pence was widely criticized by various people for what was considered a publicity stunt. Democratic representative Adam Schiff (CA-28) questioned how much taxpayer's money was used to fund Pence's actions,[218] and it was later estimated that the cost of it all was about $242,500.[219] 49ers safety Eric Reid (the second NFL player after Colin Kaepernick to participate in the protests) told reporters it was predictable that Pence would walk out, knowing that most of the team were protesting.[218] Reid also expressed doubt over the regularity Pence is in terms of attending Colts matches, and referenced a photograph of the vice president and his wife in Colts uniform that had been tweeted before the match,[218] although the official photograph (right) proved otherwise. The photograph in question was first published in 2014.[220] Sportswriter Peter King wrote that the furor surrounding Pence had overshadowed Peyton Manning, who was being honored by the Colts, saying, \"Pence trumped a day that belonged to the greatest football hero the state of Indiana has ever seen, and he did it for political purposes\u00a0... he stole Manning's last great day as a Colt. [He] will have to live with himself for that.\"[218] The following year, Pence reacted positively on Twitter, after NFL owners unanimously decided to approve a new policy requiring all players to stand (or, given the option to stay in the locker room) during the national anthem, despite not consulting the NFL Players' Association.[221]\nOn February 1, 2018, it was announced that Pence would lead the presidential delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics, alongside his wife.[222] Much of Pence's time at PyeongChang was affected by the ongoing North Korean crisis. Prior to the opening ceremony, on February 9, Pence skipped on a dinner held by South Korean president Moon Jae-in, as he would have shared a table with North Korea's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam.[223] Instead, he met with four North Korean defectors in Pyeongtaek, alongside his special guest, Fred Warmbier (the father of Otto Warmbier, who was arrested in North Korea for attempted theft, and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, before returning to the U.S. in a comatose state).[224][225][226] At the ceremony, the Pences were seated in front of the North Korean delegates, and when North and South Korean athletes entered during the Parade of Athletes, they chose to stay seated, which prompted critics to accuse Pence of hypocrisy in regards to the NFL protests.[227][228] Pence was supposed to meet with the North Koreans on February 10, but they pulled out at the last minute.[229]\nOver the next few months, the North Koreans started communicating more with their neighbors, as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un secretly met with Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping in March and then Moon Jae-in in an historic inter-Korean summit in April,[230][231] and around the same time, a meeting between Trump and Kim was also proposed. On May 10, Pence accompanied Trump to Andrews Air Force Base as three American citizens were released by North Korea, and in an early morning interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl, he said seeing the men back on American soil \"was really one of the greatest joys of my life.\"[232][233] Talks broke down later that month following comments made by Pence and Trump, comparing the situation to events in Libya seven years previous, despite their voluntary disarmament of nuclear weapons in 2003.[234] North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui called Pence's remarks \"ignorant and stupid\".[235] On May 24, Trump abruptly called off the summit with Pence in attendance,[234] only for him to change his mind a day later,[236] later announcing that it would still be scheduled to take place on June 12 in Singapore.[237]\nIn May 2017, Pence filed FEC paperwork to form Great America Committee, a PAC that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst.[238][239] This is the only time a vice president has started his own PAC while still in office.[240] Pence denied a New York Times article's allegations that he will run for president in 2020, calling them \"laughable and absurd\", and said the article was \"disgraceful and offensive\".[241]\nPence is a key player in the Trump-Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry. After the inquiry was opened, Pence publicly stated his support of Trump's call for foreign investigation into 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden, saying, \"I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position.\"[242] House committees have requested information from Biden regarding the executive branch's dealings with Ukraine. Pence has had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Pence told the press that he did not mention Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption.[243]\nPence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to assassinate Iran's General Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Queda attacks on the United States to Iran. In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani, \"an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans.\" Pence insisted Soleimani, \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States,\" which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers, who actually numbered 19, and insinuating without evidence, that the general was involved. Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated.[244] Pence's spokeswoman Katie Waldman said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, 10 of whom \"were assisted by Soleimani\".[245]\nIn June 2019, the Democratic former New York City Council President Andrew Stein opined that Trump could improve his re-election chances by replacing Pence as his running mate with former South Carolina Governor and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.[246] Despite that, Trump has said Pence will be his running mate, but declined to endorse Pence in 2019 should his running mate seek to succeed him, but said he would give it \"very strong consideration\".[247]\nPence is described as being staunchly conservative on fiscal and social issues, with his political views strongly shaped by his Christian faith and by the conservative political theorist Russell Kirk.[1] During his acceptance speech for the nomination of Republican vice presidential candidate at the 2016 Republican National Convention he said, \"I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\"[248] As one commentator put it, \"Pence doesn't simply wear his faith on his sleeve\u2014he wears the entire Jesus jersey.\"[16]\nPence is an opponent of abortion, and his unwavering support of abortion restrictions has gained him the support of grassroots conservative activists.[249] He began seeking to defund Planned Parenthood in 2007[250] and in three congressional sessions, he introduced legislation to block organizations that provide abortion services from receiving any Title X funding, even for services not related to reproductive health or family planning.[251]\nPence has criticized comprehensive sex education. In 2002, he criticized a speech by then-secretary of state Colin Powell, who had said it was \"important for young people\u00a0... to protect themselves from the possibility of acquiring any sexually transmitted disease\" through the use of condoms.[252][253] Pence called Powell's comments a \"sad day\" and expressed his support for abstinence education.[252][253] He asserted that \"condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases\" and that Powell was \"maybe inadvertently misleading millions of young people and endangering lives\".[252][253]\nPence opposed President Obama's executive order eliminating restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research, saying, \"I believe it is morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for research\u00a0... I believe it is morally wrong to take the tax dollars of millions of pro-life Americans.\"[254][255] He asserted that \"scientific breakthroughs have rendered embryonic stem-cell research obsolete\".[254][255]\nOn January 27, 2017, Pence spoke at the March for Life in Washington D.C., becoming the first vice president and the highest-ranking United States official to ever speak at the annual event.[256][257]\nPence has said he supports an overturn of Roe v. Wade, though denying that Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for that purpose.[258][259]\nPence has been a vocal opponent of efforts to expand LGBT civil rights, during both his governorship and his tenure as a U.S. representative. In 2000 he said, \"Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a 'discrete and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\"[260] Pence's 2000 congressional campaign website included text that called for \"an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus\" and instead advocated for resources to be directed toward institutions \"which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior\".[261][262][263][264] Pence has also been accused by LGBT rights advocates of endorsing conversion therapy, a charge he denies.[265]\nIn 2007, Pence voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have banned workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[266] Pence opposed the 2009 Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act,[267] saying that Barack Obama wanted to \"advance a radical social agenda\"[268] and said that pastors \"could be charged or be subject to intimidation for simply expressing a Biblical worldview on the issue of homosexual behavior\".[269]\nPence has said that homosexuals should not serve in the military, saying, \"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service because the presence of homosexuals in the ranks weakens unit cohesion.\"[270] Pence opposed the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" saying in 2010 that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military would \"have an impact on unit cohesion\".[270][271]\nPence opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.[272] While in the House, he said that \"societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family\".[273] He has advocated a constitutional same-sex marriage ban but did not champion such a proposed ban for his first year as governor.[274]\nSince entering politics, Pence has been widely condemned for his opposition to LGBT rights, by politicians, celebrities, and academics, who have accused Pence of promoting and encouraging homophobia and transphobia. Rolling Stone published an article in 2016 assailing Pence for his anti-LGBT and other actions as governor, and a book by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner condemned Pence as a \"Christian supremacist.\"[275][276] Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBT rights organization, has frequently censured Pence over his views on rights for the LGBT community, delivering a report in April 2018 that heavily excoriated Pence for his \"homophobic\" history.[277] Among the protests against Donald Trump, protesters have also targeted Pence; in May 2017, students at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, walked out of classes on the day of a speech delivered at the university by Pence, to protest Pence's anti-LGBT rhetoric.[278] In March 2018, Jill Twiss, a writer for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver wrote with Oliver a children's book about Pence's pet rabbit Marlon Bundo; the book's pro-LGBT themes and support of same-sex marriage were praised by LGBT rights groups and reviewers on Amazon, becoming a bestseller after it was published; the book aimed to disparage Pence for his anti-LGBT rhetoric, and spoofed Charlotte Pence's children's book about the rabbit following her father around on a day as vice president, Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President.[279][280] Pence's daughter Charlotte expressed her support for the parody book and the charities both books benefitted.[281]\nDuring the 2018 Winter Olympics held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, openly gay figure skater Adam Rippon declined an invitation to a meeting with Pence in Pyeongchang, citing Pence's anti-LGBT history and alleged support for conversion therapy.[282] When Pence was made aware of Rippon's statement, he published a response on Twitter calling the charge of supporting conversion therapy \"fake news.\"[283] John Oliver berated Pence for his hostility towards LGBT citizens and accused him of lying in his denials of supporting conversion therapy by pointing out Pence's longtime friendship with evangelist and anti-LGBT activist James Dobson, who promoted conversion therapy.[284] Following the tweet, the New York Times brought attention to a statement from Pence's campaign website in 2000: \"Resources should be directed towards those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\" The statement was interpreted as evidence of hypocrisy by Pence, which generated heavy criticism from the medical and LGBT community, though a Pence spokeswoman in January said the \"accusation is totally false\" citing that changing \u201csexual behavior\u201d referred to Pence\u2019s support of the Ryan White CARE Act which encourages safe sex practices to combat HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. [285][286] The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler has called the allegations that Pence supported conversion therapy as \"a dubious assumption\", while other media such as CNN promoted the allegations as truthful.[287]\nPence's legislative history regarding LGBT rights has also come under political criticism. South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay, described Pence in August 2018 as \"a social extremist.\"[288] In June 2018, Pence visited Philadelphia. Prior to his arrival in the city, openly gay lawmaker Brian Sims, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 182nd district, posted a message and accompanying photo on Facebook of himself giving the middle finger to Pence, with the caption beneath the photo containing a statement denouncing Pence and his views on LGBT rights.[289] The posting of the image quickly drew controversy; while progressive commentators and media outlets lauded Sims for the message, right-wing and conservative sources were critical of Sims and the post, accusing him of lacking basic respect for the vice president; Sims responded on Twitter to the negative press by individually mocking detractors of the post and accusing them of supporting Donald Trump's alleged sexual assaults of women (which came to light following the release of a recording of Trump making obscene comments about women in 2016), and the controversial separations of immigrant families at the southern border conducted under the Trump administration.[289] Pence faced other protests and opposition during his visit to Philadelphia.\nIn January 2019, Pence's wife, Second Lady Karen Pence announced that she would return to teaching at Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C. The announcement drew immediate controversy based on Immanuel Christian School's code of conduct, which included that the school would refuse admission to students who were involved in or who had tolerated \"sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity.\" After Second Lady Pence and the school were condemned by the media, Pence defended his wife, stating in an interview, \"To see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us.\" Pence was in turn condemned for the defense; on January 19, singer and LGBT activist Lady Gaga denounced the Pences and Immanuel Christian School at a concert in Las Vegas, stating that Pence believes \"it's acceptable that his wife works at a school that bans LGBTQ. You are wrong!\", among other related statements.[290][291][292]\nIn March 2019, former Vice President Joe Biden referred to Pence as \"a decent guy\" during a speech at the University of Nebraska Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska, a month before Biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign. LGBT groups, progressive leaders and celebrities strongly criticized him, with actress and New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon chastising Biden on Twitter, to which Biden responded by apologizing and criticizing Pence's stance on LGBT rights. Nixon later penned an op-ed in The Washington Post calling Pence \"insidious and dangerous\" for his actions on LGBT rights, also condemning Pence's actions against abortion as Governor of Indiana and accusing the Vice President of continuing to support conversion therapy, writing that \"It's easy to say nice things about Pence when you're not personally threatened by his agenda. If Biden were being directly attacked in the same way that our community is, I think he would see Pence from a very different vantage point.\"[293][294]\nPence was a co-sponsor of H.J.Res.73, a 2011 spending limit amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This amendment would limit federal spending to \"the average annual revenue collected in the three prior years, adjusted in proportion to changes in population and inflation\".[295] In regards to adopting the gold standard, Pence said in 2011, \"the time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nation's monetary affairs\".[296] Pence proposed legislation to end the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve (maximizing employment and stabilizing prices), requiring the Fed to just focus on price stability and not full employment.[297][298] He has been a proponent of a flat federal tax rate.[299] Pence opposed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) (the \"Wall Street bailout\") of 2008.[299] Pence also opposed the auto industry rescue package of 2008\u201309, which guided General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy.[300]\nIn 2007, Pence voted against raising the federal minimum wage to $7.25 (from $5.15) an hour over two years, saying it would \"hurt the working poor\".[81] While in the House, Pence voted against the Employee Free Choice Act (\"card check\").[82] He voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[301] He had publicly opposed the bill[302] denouncing it as a failure, and called for a federal spending freeze.[303] Nevertheless, several months after voting against the bill, Pence privately sought $6\u00a0million in stimulus funds for projects in his district,[304] and in 2010, hosted a job fair for stimulus-backed employers.[305] A Pence spokesperson said that \"once it became law, he had a responsibility to support local efforts to secure funding for projects that could benefit people in his district\".[304] Pence voted against the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.[306]\nPence was a supporter of earmark reform. He voted against the $139.7\u00a0billion Transportation-Treasury spending bill in June 2006, and in favor of a series of amendments proposed that same month by Jeff Flake which would strip other members' earmarks from the federal budget.[307] On occasion, however, Pence secured earmarks for projects in his district.[307]\nPence voted against the act that created Medicare Part\u00a0D (a prescription drug benefit)[42] and against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[308] In June 2012, after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius, Pence likened the ruling to the September 11 terrorist attacks in a closed-door meeting of the House Republican Conference. He immediately apologized for making the statement.[309]\nIn 2001, Pence wrote an op-ed arguing against the tobacco settlement and tobacco regulation, saying they would create \"new government bureaucracies\" and encroach on private lives. He said that \"despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill\".[121][310] Pence asserted, \"two out of every three smokers does [sic] not die from a smoking related illness and nine out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer\", while acknowledging that \"smoking isn't good for you\" and people who smoke should quit.[121][310] In 2009, Pence voted against the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which allows the FDA to regulate tobacco products.[311] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pence's state of Indiana has one of the worst smoking problems in America.[254]\nPence was slow to support a needle exchange program in Indiana to combat an HIV outbreak related to needle-sharing among opioid drug users. While giving credit for the program's ultimate start, an AIDS research foundation director of public policy later deemed the outbreak \"entirely preventable\". The state's health commissioner defended Pence's speed at responding to the situation.[312]\nIn June 2006, Pence unveiled an immigration plan (which he described as \"No Amnesty Immigration reform\") that would include increased border security, followed by strict enforcement of laws against hiring illegal aliens, and a guest worker program. This guest worker program would have required participants to apply from their home country to government-approved job placement agencies that match workers with employers who cannot find Americans for the job.[313] The plan received support from conservatives such as Dick Armey,[314] but attracted criticism from other conservatives such as Richard Viguerie and paleoconservatives Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Buchanan, who, as described by The New York Times, collectively viewed Pence as lending \"his conservative prestige to a form of liberal amnesty\".[14][315]\nIn 2009, Pence opposed birthright citizenship (the legal principle set forth by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\"). He co-sponsored a bill that would have limited citizenship to children born to at least one parent who is a citizen, immigrants living permanently in the U.S. or non-citizens performing active service in the Armed Forces.[316]\nIn 2010, Pence voted against the DREAM Act, which would grant the undocumented children of illegal immigrants conditional non-immigrant status if they met certain requirements.[317] In 2010, Pence said Arizona S.B. 1070, which at the time of passage in 2010 was the nation's broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration legislation, was \"a good faith to try and restore order to their communities\".[318]\nPence supported President George W. Bush's unsuccessful 2005 proposal to partially privatize Social Security[319] by allowing workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in private investment accounts and reduce the increase in benefits for high-income participants.[320] Pence had previously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush's.[320]\nWhen asked in 2010 if he would be willing to make cuts to Social Security, Pence answered, \"I think everything has to be on the table.\"[320] When asked if he would raise the retirement age, he said, \"I'm an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu.\"[320]\nPence supported the Patriot Act on its passage in 2001,[321] and in 2005 called the act \"essential to our continued success in the war on terror here at home\".[322] Pence was a sponsor of legislation in 2009 to extend three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act (the library records provision, the roving-wiretap provision, and the lone-wolf provision) for an additional ten years.[323]\nPence \"has been a longtime, aggressive advocate of trade deals\" between the U.S. and foreign countries.[324] Pence has been a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),[324] and during his tenure in the House, he voted for every free-trade agreement that came before him.[325] Pence voted in favor of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); in favor of keeping the U.S. in the World Trade Organization; and in favor of permanent normal trade relations with China.[325] Pence also supported bilateral free-trade agreements with Colombia, South Korea, Panama, Peru, Oman, Chile and Singapore.[325] Pence's strong stance in favor of free trade sharply differs from the stance of his running mate Trump, who has condemned globalization and the liberalization of trade.[324][325]\nPence voted against the Trade and Globalization Act of 2007, which would have expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance to American workers adversely affected by globalization.[326] However, in 2014 Pence called for the \"swift adoption\" of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), urging Indiana's congressional delegation to support the trade deal.[324]\nPence supported the Iraq War Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq.[327] During the Iraq War, Pence opposed setting a public withdrawal date from Iraq. During an April 2007 visit to Baghdad, Pence and John McCain visited Shorja market, the site of a deadly attack in February 2007 which had claimed 61 lives. Pence and McCain described the visit as evidence that the security situation in Iraqi markets had improved.[328] The visit to the market took place under tight security, including helicopters overhead, and the New York Times reported that the visit gave a false indication of how secure the area was because of the extremely heavy security forces protecting McCain.[329] Pence chaired the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and was a prominent supporter of George W. Bush's Iraq War troop surge of 2007. At the time, Pence said \"the surge is working\" and defended the initial decision to invade in 2003.[327]\nPence has opposed closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and trying the suspected terrorists in the United States.[330] As an alternative, Pence has said the \"enemy combatants\" should be tried in a military tribunal.[330]\nPence has stated his support of Israel and its right to attack facilities in Iran to prevent the Iranians from developing nuclear weapons, has defended the actions of Israel in its use of deadly force in enforcing the blockade of Gaza, and has referred to Israel as \"America's most cherished ally\".[331] He visited Israel in 2014 to express his support, and in 2016 signed into law a bill which would ban Indiana from having any commercial dealings with a company that boycotts Israel.[332] He opposes a Palestinian state.[333]\nPence criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama's alleged weak leadership, saying: \"When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts. That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership.\"[334]\nTwo weeks prior to the NATO intervention in Libya, Pence thanked the Obama administration and secretary of state Hillary Clinton for their efforts to isolate the Gaddafi regime.[335][336][337] Pence expressed support for \"a no-fly zone\" and said \"Gaddafi must go.\"[335][336][337]\nPence condemned the \"terrible savagery\" against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, saying \"The images of the violence and its victims have shocked the American people, and decent people all over the world\".[338]\nPence called on Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to release Andrew Brunson, an American pastor detained in the post-coup purges in Turkey,[339] or face significant sanctions.[340] On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on two senior Turkish government ministers who were involved in the detention of Brunson.[341][342] Erdo\u011fan said the U.S. behavior will force Turkey to look for new friends and allies.[343]\nOn July 26, 2018, Pence raised the Xinjiang re-education camps issue at Ministerial To Advance Religious Freedom.[344] He said that \"Sadly, as we speak as well, Beijing is holding hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of Uyghur Muslims in so-called 're-education camps', where they're forced to endure around-the-clock political indoctrination and to denounce their religious beliefs and their cultural identity as the goal.\"[345]\nPence \"does not accept the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of climate change.\"[346] In 2001, Pence wrote in an op-ed that \"global warming is a myth,\" saying that \"the earth is actually cooler today than it was about 50 years ago\".[347][348] In 2006 and 2009, Pence expressed the view that it was unclear whether global warming was driven by human activity, and in 2009 he told political commentator Chris Matthews that there was a \"growing skepticism in the scientific community about global warming\".[349][350] In 2009, Pence led the Republican effort to defeat the American Clean Energy and Security Act (Waxman-Markey), a Democratic-backed bill to cut greenhouse gas emissions (and therefore combat climate change) through a cap-and-trade system.[346] On September 27, 2016, however, Pence said \"there's no question\" that human activity affects both the climate and the environment.[351] Pence holds a lifetime rating of four percent from the League of Conservation Voters.[352] While in the House, Pence \"voted to eliminate funding for climate education programs and to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions\".[108] Pence also \"repeatedly voted against energy efficiency and renewable energy funding and rules\" and voted \"for several bills that supported fossil fuel development, including legislation promoting offshore drilling\".[108]\nPence has questioned proposals to decrease penalties for low-level marijuana offenses in Indiana, saying the state should focus on \"reducing crime, not reducing penalties\".[353] In 2013, Pence expressed concern that a then-pending bill to revise the state's criminal code was not tough enough on drug crimes, and successfully lobbied to limit the reduction in sentencing of marijuana offenses.[354]\nIn 2016, he signed into law a measure that would reinstate a ten-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for certain drug offenders.[355][356]\nDuring 2014, Pence sent a letter to United States Attorney General Eric Holder, saying Indiana would not comply with federal prison rape elimination standards because they were \"too expensive\". According to the Indiana Department of Corrections, it would cost the state $15\u201320\u00a0million annually to comply with the guidelines. Pence said a number of rape prevention measures had already been \"implemented\".[357]\n\nIn 2015, Pence signed Senate Bill 94 to lengthen the statute of limitations for rape\u2014continuing for five years after sufficient DNA evidence is uncovered, enough recorded evidence is brought forth or discovered, or the offender confesses to the crime.[358] Pence also signed Senate Bill\u00a08 to allow the death penalty for beheadings if the victim was alive at the time of the offense.[358]Pence has been an advocate of federal restrictions on online gambling. In 2006, he was one of 35 cosponsors of H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte\u2013Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,[359] and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[360]\nPence praised the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission when it was announced. Pence said:\nFreedom won today in the Supreme Court. Today's ruling in the Citizens United case takes us one step closer to the Founding Fathers' vision of free speech, a vision that is cherished by all Americans and one Congress has a responsibility to protect. If the freedom of speech means anything, it means protecting the right of private citizens to voice opposition or support for their elected representatives. The fact that the court overturned a 20-year precedent speaks volumes about the importance of this issue.[361]Pence described the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, known as McCain\u2013Feingold, which regulates the financing of political campaigns, as \"oppressive restrictions on free speech\".[362]\nIn the late 1990s, Pence put forth support for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton due to lying about an affair Clinton had as president, but also further argued for the moral requirements of the office of the presidency. Pence wrote that an American president with \"bad moral habits\" can \"incinerate the planet\", thus nothing less than a president who represents \"all of our highest hopes and ideals and values\" could be accepted. Pence also brought up \"staggering rates of illegitimacy and divorce\" mandating that \"America needs to be able to look to her First Family as role models\".[363][364]\nAfter becoming vice president, Pence remained mostly silent on allegations that President Trump had extramarital affairs before his presidency with adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, but on one occasion called Daniels' allegations \"baseless\".[363][364]\nMike and Karen Pence have been married since 1985. The two met while he was in law school at Indiana University.[16] They have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.[365][366] During Pence's service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses.[11][20] Pence's son, Michael, is a first lieutenant and training to be a pilot in the United States Marine Corps.[367][368] Pence has five siblings. His oldest brother, Greg, ran in 2018 to represent Indiana's 6th congressional district in Congress (the seat previously held by Mike), and won.[369][370] Pence's father died in 1988, leaving his mother, Nancy, a widow with four grown children and two teenagers. On May 1, 2004, Pence's mother married Basil Coolidge Fritsch, a widower since 2001.[371][372]\nThe Pences have four pets: a cat, a dog, a rabbit, and a snake.[373] Their rabbit, named Marlon Bundo, was featured in two children's books, both released in March 2018. A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo was written by Jill Twiss and released on March 18, 2018.[374] Marlon Bundo's: A Day in the Life of the Vice President was written by Charlotte and released on March 19, 2018.[375]\nPence was raised in a Catholic family, served as an altar server, and attended parochial school.[4][376] He became a born-again Christian in college, while a member of a nondenominational Christian student group, and identified his first year\u2014and specifically \"a Christian music festival in Asbury, Kentucky, in the spring of 1978\"[377] referring to the Ichthus Music Festival at then Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky\u2014as the moment he made a \"commitment to Christ.\"[4][376] After that point, Pence continued to attend Mass (where he met his wife) and was a Catholic youth minister.[376] Pence called himself Catholic in a 1994 news piece, although by 1995, he and his family had joined an evangelical megachurch, the Grace Evangelical Church.[4][376] In 2013, Pence said his family was \"kind of looking for a church.\"[4] He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\" and as \"a born-again, evangelical Catholic.\"[4][376]\nWhen asked by Chris Matthews in 2009 if he believed in evolution, Pence said \"I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them. How he did that, I'll ask him about some day.\"[254][349] In a 2002 statement on the floor of the House of Representatives (reported in the Congressional Record), Pence told his colleagues \"...\u00a0I also believe that someday scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides even a remotely rational explanation for the known universe.\"[378][379]\nPence adheres to the Billy Graham rule, in which husbands avoid spending time alone with women to whom they are not married.[380][381]\n*\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nSir Ian Murray McKellen CH CBE (born 25 May 1939) is an English actor. His career spans genres ranging from Shakespearean and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction. He is the recipient of six Laurence Olivier Awards, a Tony Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BIF Award, two Saturn Awards, four Drama Desk Awards, and two Critics' Choice Awards. He has also received nominations for two Academy Awards, five Primetime Emmy Awards, and four BAFTAs. He achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in Richard III (1995), James Whale in Gods and Monsters (1998), Magneto in the X-Men films, and Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. The BBC states that his \"performances have guaranteed him a place in the canon of English stage and film actors\".[2][3] A recipient of every major theatrical award in the UK, McKellen is regarded as a British cultural icon.[4][5] He started his professional career in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of their highly regarded repertory company. In 1965, McKellen made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's Richard II and Marlowe's Edward II, and he firmly established himself as one of the country's foremost classical actors. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain. McKellen was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1979 Birthday Honours, was knighted in the 1991 New Year Honours for services to the performing arts, and made a Companion of Honour for services to drama and to equality in the 2008 New Year Honours.[6][7][8][9] He has been openly gay since 1988, and continues to be a champion for LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded Freedom of the City of London in October 2014.[10] McKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire,[11][12] the son of Margery Lois (n\u00e9e Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.[13] Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951, after his father had been promoted.[13][14] The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that \"only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal.\"[14] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: \"Well, darling, you forget\u2014I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old.\u201d[15] McKellen's father was a civil engineer[16] and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent.[17] Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a \"strict, evangelical Protestant minister\" in Ballymena, County Antrim.[18] His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. \"My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met.\"[19] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 24. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a member of the Religious Society of Friends, he said, \"Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore.\"[20] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a \"grandfather of the modern weekend\".[21] McKellen attended Bolton School (Boys' Division),[22] of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron.[23] An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.[13] When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.[13] His sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, Twelfth Night,[24] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their Macbeth and Wigan High School for Girls' production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[25] In 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.[26] He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the College. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in Henry IV alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), Cymbeline (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and Doctor Faustus.[27][28][29] During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a huge impact on McKellen's future career. McKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre, as Roper in A Man for All Seasons, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's Cymbeline had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[27][29] After four years in regional repertory theatres he made his first West End appearance, in A Scent of Flowers, regarded as a \"notable success\".[27] In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Richard II (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Marlowe's Edward II (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.[30] In the 1970s and 1980s McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles, including the title role in Macbeth (which he had first played for Trevor Nunn in a \"gripping...out of the ordinary\" production, with Judi Dench, at Stratford in 1976), and Iago in Othello, in award-winning productions directed by Nunn.[27] Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn. In 2007 he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of King Lear and The Seagull, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he appeared in a very popular revival of Waiting for Godot at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart.[31][32] He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.[33] In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from The Tempest.[34] In October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his \"last big Shakespearean part\".[35] He performed the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End during the summer of 2018.[36][37] McKellen had taken film roles throughout his career\u2014beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in A Touch of Love, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in Priest of Love,[38] but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films.[26] In 1993, he had a supporting role as a South African tycoon in the critically acclaimed[39] Six Degrees of Separation, in which he starred with Stockard Channing, Donald Sutherland, and Will Smith. In the same year, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries Tales of the City, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin, and the film Last Action Hero, in which he briefly played Death opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger and Charles Dance. Later in 1993, McKellen appeared in the television film And the Band Played On about the discovery of the AIDS virus for which McKellen won a CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.[40] In 1995, he played the title role in Richard III,[41] which transported the setting into an alternative 1930s in which England is ruled by fascists. The film was a critical success.[42] McKellen co-produced and co-wrote the film, adapting the play for the screen based on a stage production of Shakespeare's play directed by Richard Eyre for the Royal National Theatre in which McKellen had appeared.[26][42] As executive producer he returned his \u00a350,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle.[43] In his review of the film, The Washington Post film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen's performance a \"lethally flamboyant incarnation\" and said his \"florid mastery ... dominates everything\".[44] His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He appeared in the modestly acclaimed film[45] Apt Pupil, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King. McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. He was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the 1998 film Gods and Monsters, wherein he played James Whale, the director of Show Boat (1936) and Frankenstein.[26] In 1999 McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film X-Men and its sequels X2: X-Men United (2003) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).[26] He later made a short appearance as an older Magneto in 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011's X-Men: First Class.[46] While filming the first X-Men film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson's three-film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings (consisting of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003) ). He received honors from the Screen Actors Guild for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in The Fellowship of the Ring and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the Lord of the Rings films,[47] then reprised the role on screen in Jackson's film adaptation of The Hobbit, which was released in three parts from 2012 to 2014.[48] On 16 March 2002, he hosted Saturday Night Live. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show The Simpsons in a special British-themed episode entitled \"The Regina Monologues\", along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television's long running British soap opera, Coronation Street, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. He narrated Richard Bell's film Eighteen as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson. McKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot),[49] Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.[50] McKellen responded, \"I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie\u2014not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story.\" He continued, \"And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it\".[50] McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor \u2013 Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner.[51] In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. On 23 August 2013 the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015.[52][53] In November 2013, McKellen appeared in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary comedy homage The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot.[54] In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins' Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's The Dresser, alongside Edward Fox and Emily Watson.[55] In 2017, McKellen portrayed Cogsworth in the live-action adaptation of Disney's Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after Gods and Monsters and Mr. Holmes) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens.[56] Also that year, McKellen appeared in the documentary McKellen: Playing the Part, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen's life and career as an actor. In 2019, McKellen starred in The Good Liar with Helen Mirren,[57] and additionally played Gus the Theatre Cat in Cats, an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, directed by Tom Hooper, and also featuring Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench.[58] McKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964.[59] Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse.[60] In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends with Mathias later directing McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.[61] McKellen is an atheist.[62] In the late 1980s, McKellen lost his appetite for meat except for fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.[63] In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).[64] He has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien's constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the Lord of the Rings and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies, whose character was also one of the original nine companions, arranged for his stunt double to get the tattoo instead.[65] He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.[66] In 2012, McKellen stated on his blog that \"There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I've not needed any treatment.\"[67] He became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013[68] in order to preside over the marriage of his friend and X-Men co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.[69] McKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014.[70] He was made a Freeman of the city of London on Thursday 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. McKellen was nominated by London's Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was chosen as he was an \"exceptional actor\" and \"tireless campaigner for equality\".[71] He is also an Emeritus Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.[72] While McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio.[73] The context that prompted McKellen's decision\u2014overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career\u2014was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament.[26] Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality \"... as a kind of pretended family relationship\".[74] McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay.[26][75] McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin.[26] In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.[76] He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.[19] Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland. In 2003, during an appearance on Have I Got News For You, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, \"Fuck off, I'm gay.\"[77] McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Dame Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.[78] McKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented that: I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about\u2014nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.[79] McKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[80] McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month,[81] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation,[82] and FFLAG where he appears in their video \"Parents Talking\".[83] In 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, \"I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena\": This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.[19] In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade[84] and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.[81] In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.[80] In 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.[85]McKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended.[86] In December 2008, he was named in Out's annual Out 100 list.[87] In 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool's Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.[88] In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, a \"coward\" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.[89] In 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.[90] In April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.[91] A cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[92][93] McKellen is an honorary board member for the New York and Washington, DC based organization Only Make Believe.[94] Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012[95] and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013.[96] He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping down to his Lord of the Rings underwear on stage. McKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming The Hobbit in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour \"Shakespeare, Tolkien, and You!\", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (Waiting for Godot in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.[97] In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.[98] A friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to For Ian Charleson: A Tribute.[99] A recording of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum.[100][101] He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's The Tempest.[34]",

His career spans genres ranging from Shakespearean and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction.\nHe is the recipient of six Laurence Olivier Awards, a Tony Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BIF Award, two Saturn Awards, four Drama Desk Awards, and two Critics' Choice Awards. He has also received nominations for two Academy Awards, five Primetime Emmy Awards, and four BAFTAs.\nHe achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in Richard III (1995), James Whale in Gods and Monsters (1998), Magneto in the X-Men films, and Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.\nThe BBC states that his \"performances have guaranteed him a place in the canon of English stage and film actors\".[2][3] A recipient of every major theatrical award in the UK, McKellen is regarded as a British cultural icon.[4][5] He started his professional career in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of their highly regarded repertory company. In 1965, McKellen made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's Richard II and Marlowe's Edward II, and he firmly established himself as one of the country's foremost classical actors. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain.\nMcKellen was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1979 Birthday Honours, was knighted in the 1991 New Year Honours for services to the performing arts, and made a Companion of Honour for services to drama and to equality in the 2008 New Year Honours.[6][7][8][9] He has been openly gay since 1988, and continues to be a champion for LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded Freedom of the City of London in October 2014.[10]\nMcKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire,[11][12] the son of Margery Lois (n\u00e9e Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.[13] Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951, after his father had been promoted.[13][14] The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that \"only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal.\"[14] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: \"Well, darling, you forget\u2014I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old.\u201d[15]\nMcKellen's father was a civil engineer[16] and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent.[17] Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a \"strict, evangelical Protestant minister\" in Ballymena, County Antrim.[18] His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. \"My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met.\"[19] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 24. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a member of the Religious Society of Friends, he said, \"Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore.\"[20] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a \"grandfather of the modern weekend\".[21]\nMcKellen attended Bolton School (Boys' Division),[22] of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron.[23] An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.[13] When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.[13]\nHis sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, Twelfth Night,[24] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their Macbeth and Wigan High School for Girls' production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[25]\nIn 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.[26] He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the College. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in Henry IV alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), Cymbeline (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and Doctor Faustus.[27][28][29] During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a huge impact on McKellen's future career.\nMcKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre, as Roper in A Man for All Seasons, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's Cymbeline had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[27][29]\nAfter four years in regional repertory theatres he made his first West End appearance, in A Scent of Flowers, regarded as a \"notable success\".[27] In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Richard II (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Marlowe's Edward II (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.[30]\nIn the 1970s and 1980s McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles, including the title role in Macbeth (which he had first played for Trevor Nunn in a \"gripping...out of the ordinary\" production, with Judi Dench, at Stratford in 1976), and Iago in Othello, in award-winning productions directed by Nunn.[27] Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn.\nIn 2007 he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of King Lear and The Seagull, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he appeared in a very popular revival of Waiting for Godot at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart.[31][32] He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.[33] In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from The Tempest.[34]\nIn October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his \"last big Shakespearean part\".[35] He performed the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End during the summer of 2018.[36][37]\nMcKellen had taken film roles throughout his career\u2014beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in A Touch of Love, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in Priest of Love,[38] but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films.[26] In 1993, he had a supporting role as a South African tycoon in the critically acclaimed[39] Six Degrees of Separation, in which he starred with Stockard Channing, Donald Sutherland, and Will Smith. In the same year, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries Tales of the City, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin, and the film Last Action Hero, in which he briefly played Death opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger and Charles Dance.\nLater in 1993, McKellen appeared in the television film And the Band Played On about the discovery of the AIDS virus for which McKellen won a CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.[40] In 1995, he played the title role in Richard III,[41] which transported the setting into an alternative 1930s in which England is ruled by fascists. The film was a critical success.[42] McKellen co-produced and co-wrote the film, adapting the play for the screen based on a stage production of Shakespeare's play directed by Richard Eyre for the Royal National Theatre in which McKellen had appeared.[26][42] As executive producer he returned his \u00a350,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle.[43] In his review of the film, The Washington Post film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen's performance a \"lethally flamboyant incarnation\" and said his \"florid mastery ... dominates everything\".[44] His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\nHe appeared in the modestly acclaimed film[45] Apt Pupil, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King. McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. He was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the 1998 film Gods and Monsters, wherein he played James Whale, the director of Show Boat (1936) and Frankenstein.[26]\nIn 1999 McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film X-Men and its sequels X2: X-Men United (2003) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006).[26] He later made a short appearance as an older Magneto in 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011's X-Men: First Class.[46]\nWhile filming the first X-Men film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson's three-film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings (consisting of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003) ). He received honors from the Screen Actors Guild for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in The Fellowship of the Ring and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the Lord of the Rings films,[47] then reprised the role on screen in Jackson's film adaptation of The Hobbit, which was released in three parts from 2012 to 2014.[48]\nOn 16 March 2002, he hosted Saturday Night Live. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show The Simpsons in a special British-themed episode entitled \"The Regina Monologues\", along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television's long running British soap opera, Coronation Street, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. He narrated Richard Bell's film Eighteen as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson.\nMcKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot),[49] Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.[50] McKellen responded, \"I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie\u2014not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story.\" He continued, \"And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it\".[50] McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor \u2013 Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner.[51] In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. On 23 August 2013 the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015.[52][53]\nIn November 2013, McKellen appeared in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary comedy homage The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot.[54] In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins' Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's The Dresser, alongside Edward Fox and Emily Watson.[55] In 2017, McKellen portrayed Cogsworth in the live-action adaptation of Disney's Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after Gods and Monsters and Mr. Holmes) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens.[56] Also that year, McKellen appeared in the documentary McKellen: Playing the Part, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen's life and career as an actor.\nIn 2019, McKellen starred in The Good Liar with Helen Mirren,[57] and additionally played Gus the Theatre Cat in Cats, an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, directed by Tom Hooper, and also featuring Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench.[58]\nMcKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964.[59] Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse.[60] In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends with Mathias later directing McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.[61]\nMcKellen is an atheist.[62] In the late 1980s, McKellen lost his appetite for meat except for fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.[63] In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).[64]\nHe has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien's constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the Lord of the Rings and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies, whose character was also one of the original nine companions, arranged for his stunt double to get the tattoo instead.[65]\nHe was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.[66] In 2012, McKellen stated on his blog that \"There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I've not needed any treatment.\"[67]\nHe became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013[68] in order to preside over the marriage of his friend and X-Men co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.[69]\nMcKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014.[70] He was made a Freeman of the city of London on Thursday 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. McKellen was nominated by London's Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was chosen as he was an \"exceptional actor\" and \"tireless campaigner for equality\".[71] He is also an Emeritus Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.[72]\n\nWhile McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio.[73] The context that prompted McKellen's decision\u2014overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career\u2014was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament.[26] Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality \"... as a kind of pretended family relationship\".[74] McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay.[26][75] McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin.[26] In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.[76] He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.[19] Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.\nIn 2003, during an appearance on Have I Got News For You, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, \"Fuck off, I'm gay.\"[77] McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Dame Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.[78]\nMcKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented that:\nI have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about\u2014nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.[79]\nMcKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[80] McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month,[81] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation,[82] and FFLAG where he appears in their video \"Parents Talking\".[83]\nIn 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, \"I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena\": This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.[19] In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade[84] and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.[81] In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.[80]\n\nIn 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.[85]McKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended.[86] In December 2008, he was named in Out's annual Out 100 list.[87]\nIn 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool's Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.[88] In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, a \"coward\" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.[89]\nIn 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.[90]\nIn April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged.

While in New Zealand filming The Hobbit in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour \"Shakespeare, Tolkien, and You!\", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (Waiting for Godot in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.[97] In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.[98]\nA friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to For Ian Charleson: A Tribute.[99] A recording of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum.[100][101] He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's The Tempest.[34]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nCaitlyn Marie Jenner (born William Bruce Jenner; October 28, 1949) is an American television personality and retired Olympic gold medal\u2013winning decathlete. Jenner played college football for the Graceland Yellowjackets before incurring a knee injury that required surgery. Convinced by Olympic decathlete Jack Parker's coach, L.\u00a0D.\u00a0Weldon, to try the decathlon, Jenner culminated a 6 year decathlon career by winning the men's decathlon event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal,[3][4] setting a third successive world record and gaining fame as \"an all-American hero\".[5] Given the unofficial title of \"world's greatest athlete\",[6] Jenner established a career in television, film, writing, auto racing, business, and as a Playgirl cover model.[7] Jenner has six children with three successive wives\u2014Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner\u2014and has since 2007 appeared on the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians with Kris, their daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kris's other children Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian. Assigned male at birth, Caitlyn Jenner publicly came out as a trans woman in April 2015. Her new name was publicly announced in July of that year, with her name and gender being legally changed the following September.[8] From 2015 to 2016, Jenner starred in the reality television series I Am Cait, which focused on her gender transition. In January 2017, she underwent sex reassignment surgery.[9] Jenner has been called the most famous transgender woman in the world.[10][11] Caitlyn Marie Jenner was born William Bruce Jenner on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York.[12] She was known as Bruce Jenner until June 2015. Her parents are Esther Ruth (n\u00e9e McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner, who was an arborist.[13][14] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Welsh descent.[15] Her younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner's success at the Olympic Games.[16][17] As a young child, Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia.[18] Jenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for her freshman and sophomore years[19][20] and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for her junior and senior years, graduating in 1968.[21] Jenner earned a football scholarship and attended Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury.[22] Recognizing Jenner's potential, Graceland track coach L. D. Weldon encouraged Jenner to switch to the decathlon.[23] Jenner debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place.[24] Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.[25] At the 1972 U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was in fifth place in the men's decathlon, behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes, with only the last event remaining. Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the men's 1500 metres, Jenner qualified for the Olympic team by running a fast final lap, finishing 22 seconds ahead of the other runners. This prompted the Eugene Register-Guard to ask: \"Who's Jenner?\"[26][27] Following the Olympic Trials, Jenner finished in tenth place in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.[28] By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, Jenner was inspired to start an intense training regimen. \"For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, and this guy has it. I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games. I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 6\u20138 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year.\"[29] After graduating from Graceland, Jenner married girlfriend Chrystie Crownover and moved to San Jose, California. Crownover provided most of the family income by working as a flight attendant for United Airlines.[30] Jenner trained during the day and sold insurance at night, earning US$9,000 a year.[31][32] In the era before professional American athletes were allowed to compete in Olympic sports, this kind of training was unheard of. On the other hand, Soviet athletes were state-sponsored, which gave them a certain advantage over amateur American athletes.[33][34][34] During this period, Jenner trained at the San Jose City College (SJCC) and San Jose State University (SJSU) tracks.[35][36] San Jose athletics centered on SJCC coach Bert Bonanno; at that time, the city was a hotbed for training and was called the \"Track Capital of the World\".[32] Many other aspiring Olympic athletes also trained at San Jose; the list included Millard Hampton, Andre Phillips, John Powell, Mac Wilkins, and Al Feuerbach.[35][37] Jenner's most successful events were the skill events of the second day: hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1500 meters.[5][38] Jenner was the American champion in the men's decathlon event in 1974, and was featured on the cover of Track & Field News magazine's August 1974 issue.[39][40] While on tour in 1975, Jenner won the French national championship,[41] and a gold medal at the 1975 Pan American Games, earning the tournament record with 8,045 points.[25] This was followed by new world records of 8,524 points at the U.S.A./U.S.S.R./Poland triangular meet in Eugene, Oregon on August 9\u201310, 1975, breaking Avilov's record,[42] and 8,538 points at the 1976 Olympic trials, also in Eugene.[27][43] The record in Eugene was a hybrid score because a timing system failure and wind aided marks. Still, Jenner was proud of \"A nice little workout, huh?\" \"We got what we wanted. We scared the hell out of everybody in the world only a month away from the Games.\"[44] Of the 13 decathlons Jenner competed in between 1973 and 1976, the only loss was at the 1975 AAU National Championships, when a \"no height\" in the pole vault marred the score.[25] At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Jenner achieved five personal bests on the first day of the men's decathlon\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a \"home run\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0despite being in second place behind Guido Kratschmer of West Germany. Jenner was confident: \"The second day has all my good events. If everything works out all right, we should be ahead after it's all over.\" Following a rainstorm on the second day, Jenner watched teammate Fred Dixon get injured in the 110 meter hurdles,[45] so took a cautious approach to the hurdles and discus, then had personal bests in the pole vault, when Jenner took the lead, and javelin.[46] By that point, victory was virtually assured, but it remained to be seen by how much Jenner would improve the record. In the final event\u2014the 1500 meters, which was seen live on national television\u2014Jenner looked content to finish the long competition. Jenner sprinted the last lap, making up a 50-meter deficit and nearly catching the event favorite, Soviet Leonid Litvinenko, who was already well out of contention for the gold medal, but whose personal best had been eight seconds better than Jenner's personal best before the race. Jenner set a new personal best time and won the gold medal with a world-record score of 8,618 points.[5][27][29][47][48] Olympic world record performance:[49] After the event, Jenner took an American flag from a spectator and carried it during the victory lap, starting a tradition that is now common among winning athletes.[50][51] Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: \"In 1972, I made the decision that I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this.\"[29] Jenner explained, \"It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got the rest of my life to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?\"[5] As a result of winning the Olympic decathlon, Jenner became a national hero and received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States and was also named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1976.[4][22] Jenner's 1976 world and Olympic record was broken by four points by Daley Thompson at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow; Thompson's victory was perhaps tainted by the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, though the top American at the time, Bobby Coffman, was not expected to push Thompson or challenge Jenner's record. In 1985, Jenner's Olympic decathlon score was reevaluated against the IAAF's updated decathlon scoring table and was reported as 8,634 for comparative purposes. This converted mark stood as the American record until 1991, when it was surpassed by eventual gold medalist, and world record holder, Dan O'Brien of Dan & Dave fame.[52] As of 2018[update], Jenner was ranked twenty-sixth on the world all-time list and ninth on the American all-time list.[53] Jenner was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1980, the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986, the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame and the Connecticut Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, and the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.[54] For almost 20 years, San Jose City College hosted an annual Bruce Jenner Invitational competition.[55][56][57] All information from IAAF[61] In the 1970s, Olympic athletes were considered to be amateurs and were not allowed to seek or accept payment for their positions as sports celebrities. During the Cold War in 1972, three major Olympic titles that had a long history of American success\u00a0\u2013\u00a0basketball, the 100 meter dash, and decathlon\u00a0\u2013\u00a0were won by Soviet athletes. All Soviet athletes were professionals, while the United States was limited to amateurs.[62][33][34][34] Jenner became an American hero by returning the decathlon title to the United States. \"After the Games were over,\" Jenner said, \"I happened to be the right guy, at that right place, at that right time.\"[29] Tony Kornheiser of The New York Times wrote: \"Jenner is twirling the nation like a baton. He and wife, Chrystie, are so high up on the pedestal of American heroism, it would take a crane to get them down.\"[5][30][63] After the expected Olympic success, Jenner planned to cash in on whatever celebrity status could follow a gold medal in the same mold as Johnny Weissmuller and Sonja Henie, who had become major movie stars following their gold medals. This would require forgoing any future Olympic competition. At the time, Jenner's agent George Wallach felt there was a four-year window\u00a0\u2013\u00a0until the next Olympics\u00a0\u2013\u00a0upon which to capitalize. Wallach reported that Jenner was being considered for the role of Superman, which ultimately went to Christopher Reeve. \"I really don't know how many offers we have,\" Wallach claimed. \"There are still unopened telegrams back at the hotel and you just can't believe the offers that poured in during the first two days.\"[64] Jenner appeared on the cover of the August 9, 1976, issue of Sports Illustrated,[65] the February 1979 issue of Gentleman's Quarterly,[66] and on the cover of Playgirl magazine.[7] Jenner became a spokesperson for Tropicana, Minolta, and Buster Brown shoes.[29] Jenner was also selected by the Kansas City Kings with the 139th overall pick in the seventh round of the 1977 NBA draft despite not having played basketball since high school.[67] The publicity stunt was executed by team president/general manager Joe Axelson to mock the Kansas City Chiefs' yearly claims that they planned on selecting \"the best athlete available\" in the National Football League Draft. Jenner was presented with a jersey customized with the number 8618, the Olympic-gold-medal-winning score, but would never appear as an active player with the Kings.[68] In 1977, Jenner became a spokesperson for Wheaties brand breakfast cereal and appeared in a photograph on the cover of the cereal box. After taking over from Olympic champion Bob Richards, Jenner was second in a succession of athletes featured as spokespersons for the brand. Mary Lou Retton succeeded Jenner in 1984.[71] On November 22, 1977, Jenner went to San Francisco to refute charges filed by San Francisco district attorney Joseph Freitas that General Mills\u2014the maker of Wheaties\u2014had engaged in deceptive advertising in its campaign that featured Jenner. Jenner liked Wheaties and ate the breakfast cereal two or three times a week, which supported the advertising campaign's claims. Two days later, Freitas withdrew the suit, saying that it was \"a case of overzealousness\" on the part of his staff.[72] When Jenner came out as a trans woman in 2015, General Mills stated that: \"Bruce Jenner continues to be a respected member of Team Wheaties.\" After a negative response to this initial statement, Mike Siemienas, General Mills's brand media relations manager, clarified it by saying: \"Bruce Jenner has been a respected member of Team Wheaties, and Caitlyn Jenner will continue to be.\"[73] The comedy Can't Stop the Music (1980) was Jenner's only theatrical release until 2011. Jenner had some success with a television career, starring in the made-for-TV movies The Golden Moment: An Olympic Love Story[74] (1980) and Grambling's White Tiger (1981).[75] During the 1981\u20131982 season, Jenner became a semi-regular cast member in the police series CHiPs, guest-starring as Officer Steve McLeish for six episodes, substituting for star Erik Estrada, who was locked in a contract dispute with NBC and MGM.[3] Jenner also appeared in an episode of the sitcom Silver Spoons called \"Trouble with Words\", wherein her personal issues with dyslexia were revealed in a storyline about a recurring teenage character with the same problem. Jenner appeared in the series Learn to Read[76] and in the video games Olympic Decathlon[77] (1981) and Bruce Jenner's World Class Decathlon (1996).[78] The \"hero shot\", the finish of the final event of the 1976 Olympic decathlon, and the Wheaties cover, were parodied by John Belushi on Saturday Night Live, endorsing \"Little Chocolate Donuts\".[79] In 1989, Jenner played herself in the comedy short Dirty Tennis written by James Van Patten.[80] Jenner has appeared in a variety of game shows and reality television programs, including starring with Grits Gresham in an episode of The American Sportsman.[81] In the early 1990s, Jenner was the host of an infomercial for a stair-climbing exercise machine called the Stair Climber Plus.[82] In January 2002, Jenner participated in an episode of the American series The Weakest Link, featuring Olympic athletes.[83] In February and March 2003, Jenner was part of the cast of the American series I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.[84] She made a cameo appearance in a season-three episode of The Apprentice, which aired in May 2005.[85] She also partnered with Tai Babilonia for Skating with Celebrities[86] in a series that aired January\u00a0\u2013\u00a0March 2006 (they were eliminated during the fifth of seven episodes), served as a guest judge on Pet Star on Animal Planet.[87] In November 2010, a photograph of Jenner was shown in a janitor's resume in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.[88] Additional television and talk show appearances by Jenner include: Nickelodeon's made-for-TV film Gym Teacher: The Movie[89] as well as episodes of Murder, She Wrote,[90] the Lingo Olympic Winners episode,[91] and talk shows such as Hannity[92] and season\u00a01, episode\u00a021 of The Bonnie Hunt Show in 2008.[93] Since late 2007, Jenner has starred in the E! reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians along with wife Kris Jenner, stepchildren Kourtney, Kimberley, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian (from Kris's marriage to attorney Robert Kardashian), and daughters Kylie and Kendall.[94] In 2011, Jenner appeared in the Adam Sandler comedy Jack and Jill in a scene with Al Pacino as an actor in a play.[95] Like Can't Stop the Music, the film won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture and swept every Razzie category.[96] In September 2016, Jenner appeared as herself on the Amazon Prime TV series Transparent in a dream sequence during the season three episode \"To Sardines and Back\".[97] In November 2019, it was announced that Jenner would be participating in the nineteenth season of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.[98] Jenner had a short career as a race car driver in the IMSA Camel GT series (International Motor Sports Association) in the 1980s.[99] Jenner's first victory came in the 1986 12 hours of Sebring in the IMSA GTO class driving the 7-Eleven Roush Racing Ford Mustang with co-driver Scott Pruett. The pair won their class and finished 4th overall in the 12-hour endurance race. 1986 was also the most successful year of Jenner's career, finishing second in the championship to Pruett.[100][101] Jenner commented, \"I was a lot more badass runner than I was a driver.\"[102] Jenner had licensed her previous name for Bruce Jenner's Westwood Centers for Nautilus & Aerobics in the early 1980s to David A. Cirotto, president of other local Nautilus & Aerobics Centers. She had no ownership in the licensed name centers,[31] which were solely owned by Cirotto.[103] Jenner's company, Bruce Jenner Aviation, sells aircraft supplies to executives and corporations.[31] Jenner was the business development vice president for a staffing industry software application known as JennerNet, which was based on Lotus Domino technology.[104] In March 2016, Jenner announced that she had been chosen as the face of H&M Sport.[105] Later that year, H&M created a six-minute film featuring Jenner, called Caitlyn Jenner's Greatest Victories: A Timeline.[106] In a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in April 2015, Jenner came out as a trans woman, saying that she had dealt with gender dysphoria since her youth and that, \"for all intents and purposes, I'm a woman.\" Jenner cross-dressed for many years and took hormone replacement therapy but stopped after her romance with Kris Kardashian became more serious, leading to marriage in 1991.[108][109][110] Jenner recounts having permission to explore her gender identity on her own travels but not when they were coupled, and that not knowing the best way to talk about the many issues contributed to the deterioration of the 23-year-long marriage, which ended formally in 2015.[110] Jenner has undergone cosmetic surgery, and completed sex reassignment surgery in January 2017.[9] She said she has never been sexually attracted to men, but always to women, and that, keeping in mind the difficulty people have understanding the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity, she will identify as asexual for now.[111][112] In June 2015, Jenner debuted her new name and image, and began publicly using feminine pronoun self-descriptors.[113] Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner.[114][115] Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed with the family in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized that there is no one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent first before focusing on her transition.[116] In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.[117] Jenner's announcement that she is transgender came at an unprecedented time for trans visibility, including legislative initiatives.[118][119] The 20/20 interview had 20.7 million viewers, making it television's \"highest-ever rated newsmagazine telecast among adults 18\u201349 and adults 25\u201354\".[120] The Daily Beast wrote that Jenner's honesty, vulnerability, and fame may have caused \"cheap jokes\" about trans people to \"seem mean to a mainstream audience on an unprecedented scale\".[121] Noting the shift in how comedians treated Jenner's transition, The Daily Beast saw the change as the same evolution that took place in acceptance of LGBT people as a whole when \"comedians finally cross the critical threshold from mockery to creativity in their joke-telling\".[121] Jenner's emerging gender identity was revealed in a Vanity Fair interview written by Buzz Bissinger. Annie Leibovitz photographed the cover, the magazine's first to feature an openly transgender woman, which was captioned \"Call me Caitlyn\".[122][123] Using her Twitter handle, @Caitlyn_Jenner, she tweeted: \"I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.\" Time magazine declared this tweet the tenth most re-tweeted tweet of 2015, based on re-tweets of tweets by verified users from January 1 to November 10 of that year.[124] Jenner amassed over one million Twitter followers in four hours and three minutes, setting a new Guinness World Record and surpassing United States President Barack Obama, who, a month before, accomplished the same feat in four hours and fifty-two minutes.[125][126] Four days later Jenner was up to 2.37 million followers, with another 1.5 million followers on Instagram.[127] Jenner was also mocked. Beginning in September 2015, she was depicted on the satirical American animated program South Park, which parodied her supporters' political correctness, as well as her driving record. The Jenner-related episodes were \"Stunning and Brave\", \"Where My Country Gone?\", \"Sponsored Content\", \"Truth and Advertising\" and \"PC Principal Final Justice\" from the show's 19th season.[128][129] In April 2016 during the Republican presidential primaries, Jenner became an exemplar for candidate Donald Trump's opposition to North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, with Trump saying that Jenner could use any restroom of her choosing at his Trump Tower property. Jenner soon posted a video showing that she had taken Trump up on his offer. She thanked Trump and assured Trump's adversary Ted Cruz that \"nobody got molested\".[130][131] In June 2016, Jenner was one of several celebrities depicted using synthetic nude \"sleeping\" bodies for the video of Kanye West's song \"Famous\".[132] Later that month, an episode of Epic Rap Battles of History was released featuring Jenner, as Bruce (portrayed by Peter Shukoff) and then Caitlyn (portrayed by transgender rapper Jolie \"NoShame\" Drake), rap battling against Bruce Banner (portrayed by Lloyd Ahlquist) then The Hulk (portrayed by Mike O'Hearn). In August 2015, Jenner won the Social Media Queen award at the Teen Choice Awards.[133] In October 2015, Glamour magazine named her one of its 25 Glamour Women of the Year, calling her a \"Trans Champion.\"[134] In November 2015, Jenner was listed as one of Entertainment Weekly's 2015 Entertainers of the Year.[135] In December 2015, she was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of 2015.[136] Also in that month, she was listed on Time magazine's eight-person shortlist for the 2015 Person of the Year,[137] and Bing released its list of the year's \"Most Searched Celebrities\", which Jenner was at the top of, and declared Jenner's Vanity Fair cover the second in a list of \"top celeb moments of 2015.\"[138][139] She was the second most searched for person on Google in 2015.[140] In April 2016, she was listed in the Time 100.[141] In June 2016, Jenner became the first openly transgender person to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. The cover and associated story marked the 40th anniversary of her winning the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon.[142][143] Feminist author Germaine Greer called Glamour magazine's decision to award Jenner with a \"Woman of the Year\" award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman could be better than \"someone who is just born a woman.\"[144] Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for stating\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in a BuzzFeed interview[145]\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 that the hardest part about being a woman \"is figuring out what to wear\". McGowan argued: \"We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well fucking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.\" McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: \"Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism.\"[146][147] Chris Mandle of The Independent stated: \"Jenner has gone on to inspire countless men and women, but her comments, which were made after she was celebrated at Glamour magazine's Women Of The Year in New York were branded 'offensive and insulting'.\" He added: \"People began tweeting the other, harder things women have to deal with, such as institutionalized oppression, abuse and sexual assault\".[148] James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, the only female New York Police Department officer to die on September 11, 2001, returned Moira's \"Woman of the Year\" award, given posthumously. Referring to Jenner as a man, he stated that he found Glamour giving Jenner the same award insulting to Moira's memory, and referred to the matter as a publicity stunt.[149][150] Smith later said that, having supported transgender youth and Glamour's decision to honor transgender actress Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner's \"hardest part about being a woman\" commentary; this proved to him that Jenner \"is not truly a woman. I believe this comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it.\"[151] Conversely, Adrienne Tam of The Daily Telegraph argued that Jenner deserved the Glamour award, stating: \"What McGowan failed to take into consideration was the jesting manner in which Jenner spoke.\" Tam said: [Jenner] also immediately followed up her \"what women wear\" dilemma with: It's more than that. I'm kind of at this point in my life where I'm trying to figure this womanhood thing out. It is more than hair, makeup, clothes, all that kind of stuff. There's an element here that I'm still kind of searching for. And I think that'll take a while. Because I think as far as gender, we're all on a journey. We're all learning and growing about ourselves. And I feel the same way. Tam considered McGowan's criticism to be over the top, and stated of James Smith's criticism, \"The salient point here is one about courage. We easily recognise physical courage such as saving orphans from burning buildings, or ordinary people putting their lives in the line of fire. It is far harder to recognise mental courage.\" She added: \"Without a doubt, the police officer who died in the September 11 attacks was courageous. But so is Jenner. It's a different kind of courage, but it is courage nonetheless.\"[152] Since coming out as a trans woman in 2015, Jenner has been called the most famous openly transgender woman in the world.[8][10][11] She is also one of the most recognized LGBT people in the world and arguably the most famous LGBT athlete.[153] Jenner said that her visibility was partly to bring attention to gender dysphoria, violence against trans women, and other transgender issues.[154] She also sought to promote more informed discussion of LGBT issues.[154] She signed with Creative Artists Agency's speakers department and will collaborate with the CAA Foundation on a philanthropic strategy focusing on LGBT issues.[155] She made a private appearance at the Los Angeles LGBT Center in June 2015, where she spoke with trans youth.[156] Jenner received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the 2015 ESPY Awards in July 2015. ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt said Jenner was given the award because \"she has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.\"[157] She is the third consecutive openly LGBT person to receive the award following footballer Michael Sam (2014) and anchorwoman Robin Roberts (2013).[158] In October, Jenner presented the Point Foundation's Horizon Award to television producers Rhys Ernst (of the show Transparent) and Zach Zyskowski (of the show Becoming Us).[159][160] This was her second public speaking engagement after her gender transition.[160] In November, Jenner was listed as one of the nine runners-up for The Advocate's Person of the Year.[161] That month she was also listed as one of the Out100 of 2015, with Out calling her the \"Newsmaker of the Year.\"[162] On International Human Rights Day, Jenner discussed transgender rights with Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.[163] In 2016, Jenner was on the cover of The Advocate's February/March issue.[164] MAC Cosmetics collaborated with Jenner on a lipstick, called Finally Free, which was made available for purchase April 8, 2016, with MAC stating, \"100% of the selling price goes to the MAC AIDS Fund Transgender Initiative, to further its work in support of transgender communities.\"[165][166] Also in April 2016, Jenner was listed as No.\u00a08 on Out magazine's Power 50 list.[167][168] In May 2016, her interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015 won Outstanding TV Journalism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Newsmagazine at the GLAAD Media Awards.[169] In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Jenner and others told the stories of the people killed there.[170][171] In July 2016, Jenner spoke about coming out as transgender and Republican at a Republican National Convention \"Big Tent Brunch\" for the conservative group American Unity Fund.[172][173] Jenner's gender transition is the subject of I Am Cait, initially an eight-part TV documentary series, which premiered on E! in July 2015 to an audience of 2.7 million viewers.[174][175][176] Jenner is an executive producer of the show.[177] The show focuses on Jenner's transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends. The show also explores how Jenner adjusts to what she sees as her job as a role model for the transgender community.[178][179] In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016.[180] The show tied for Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.[181][182] Jenner's memoir, The Secrets of My Life, was published on April 25, 2017.[183] Jenner is a Christian, leans towards political conservatism, and is a Republican.[184][185] \"I have gotten more flak for being a conservative Republican than I have for being trans,\" she has said.[186] Although stopping short of an endorsement, Jenner said she liked Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, despite Cruz's negative views of trans people.[187] On her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner said that although she does not support Donald Trump, she thinks he would be good for women's issues; she then stated she would never support Hillary Clinton.[188] She ended up voting for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[189] In February 2017, President Trump rescinded federal requirements giving transgender students the right to choose the school restroom matching their gender identity. In response, Jenner tweeted \"Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.\"[190] In April 2017, Jenner said she was in favor of same-sex marriage.[191] In July 2017, Jenner announced that she was contemplating running in the 2018 race for the US Senate to represent California.[192] Later in the month, she condemned Trump for issuing an order to reinstate a ban on transgender people from serving in the military. In her tweet, she wrote \"What happened to your promise to fight for them?\", juxtaposing it with Trump's tweet from June 2016 in which he promised to fight for the LGBT community.[189] In an October 2018 Washington Post opinion piece, she wrote that she was mistaken in her belief that Trump and his administration would support the LGBTQ community and vowed to learn from her error. \"The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president.\"[193] Her reversal came after a Trump administration proposal to restrict the legal definition of a person's gender to that assigned at birth.[194] Prior to her public gender transition, Jenner had been married three times, first to Chrystie Scott (n\u00e9e Crownover) from 1972 to 1981. They have two children, son Burton \"Burt\" Jenner and daughter Cassandra \"Casey\" Marino (n\u00e9e Jenner).[195][196] Jenner and Scott's divorce was finalized the first week of January 1981.[197] On January 5, 1981, Jenner married actress Linda Thompson in Hawaii.[198] They have two sons together, Brandon Jenner and Sam Brody Jenner (known as Brody).[199] By February 1986, Jenner and Thompson had separated and subsequently divorced.[200] Their sons later starred on the reality show The Princes of Malibu,[201] and Brody appeared in the reality show The Hills.[202] On April 21, 1991, Jenner married Kris Kardashian (n\u00e9e Houghton) after five months of dating.[203] They have two daughters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner. While married, Jenner was also the step-parent to Kris's children from her previous marriage\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Robert\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who star in Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The couple separated in June 2013, but the separation was not publicly announced until four months later, in October.[204][205] [206] Kris filed for divorce in September 2014, citing irreconcilable differences.[207] Their divorce terms were finalized in December 2014 and went into effect on March 23, 2015, as mandated by a state legal requirement for a six months delay after the filing.[208] In February 2015, Jenner was involved in a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. Kim Howe, an animal rights activist and actress, was killed when Jenner's SUV ran into Howe's car. Accounts of the sequence of collisions have varied, as have the number of people injured.[209] Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, but three civil lawsuits were filed against Jenner by Howe's stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved in the collision.[210][211] Jessica Steindorff, a Hollywood agent who was hit by Howe's car, settled her case in December 2015. Howe's stepchildren settled their case in January 2016.[212] Financial details were not disclosed in either case.[213]",

Convinced by Olympic decathlete Jack Parker's coach, L.\u00a0D.\u00a0Weldon, to try the decathlon, Jenner culminated a 6 year decathlon career by winning the men's decathlon event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal,[3][4] setting a third successive world record and gaining fame as \"an all-American hero\".[5] Given the unofficial title of \"world's greatest athlete\",[6] Jenner established a career in television, film, writing, auto racing, business, and as a Playgirl cover model.[7]\nJenner has six children with three successive wives\u2014Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner\u2014and has since 2007 appeared on the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians with Kris, their daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kris's other children Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian. Assigned male at birth, Caitlyn Jenner publicly came out as a trans woman in April 2015. Her new name was publicly announced in July of that year, with her name and gender being legally changed the following September.[8] From 2015 to 2016, Jenner starred in the reality television series I Am Cait, which focused on her gender transition. In January 2017, she underwent sex reassignment surgery.[9] Jenner has been called the most famous transgender woman in the world.[10][11]\nCaitlyn Marie Jenner was born William Bruce Jenner on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York.[12] She was known as Bruce Jenner until June 2015. Her parents are Esther Ruth (n\u00e9e McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner, who was an arborist.[13][14] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Welsh descent.[15] Her younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner's success at the Olympic Games.[16][17] As a young child, Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia.[18]\nJenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for her freshman and sophomore years[19][20] and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for her junior and senior years, graduating in 1968.[21] Jenner earned a football scholarship and attended Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury.[22] Recognizing Jenner's potential, Graceland track coach L. D. Weldon encouraged Jenner to switch to the decathlon.[23] Jenner debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place.[24] Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.[25]\nAt the 1972 U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was in fifth place in the men's decathlon, behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes, with only the last event remaining. Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the men's 1500 metres, Jenner qualified for the Olympic team by running a fast final lap, finishing 22 seconds ahead of the other runners. This prompted the Eugene Register-Guard to ask: \"Who's Jenner?\"[26][27] Following the Olympic Trials, Jenner finished in tenth place in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.[28] By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, Jenner was inspired to start an intense training regimen. \"For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, and this guy has it. I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games. I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 6\u20138 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year.\"[29]\nAfter graduating from Graceland, Jenner married girlfriend Chrystie Crownover and moved to San Jose, California. Crownover provided most of the family income by working as a flight attendant for United Airlines.[30] Jenner trained during the day and sold insurance at night, earning US$9,000 a year.[31][32] In the era before professional American athletes were allowed to compete in Olympic sports, this kind of training was unheard of. On the other hand, Soviet athletes were state-sponsored, which gave them a certain advantage over amateur American athletes.[33][34][34] During this period, Jenner trained at the San Jose City College (SJCC) and San Jose State University (SJSU) tracks.[35][36] San Jose athletics centered on SJCC coach Bert Bonanno; at that time, the city was a hotbed for training and was called the \"Track Capital of the World\".[32] Many other aspiring Olympic athletes also trained at San Jose; the list included Millard Hampton, Andre Phillips, John Powell, Mac Wilkins, and Al Feuerbach.[35][37] Jenner's most successful events were the skill events of the second day: hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1500 meters.[5][38]\nJenner was the American champion in the men's decathlon event in 1974, and was featured on the cover of Track &amp; Field News magazine's August 1974 issue.[39][40] While on tour in 1975, Jenner won the French national championship,[41] and a gold medal at the 1975 Pan American Games, earning the tournament record with 8,045 points.[25] This was followed by new world records of 8,524 points at the U.S.A./U.S.S.R./Poland triangular meet in Eugene, Oregon on August 9\u201310, 1975, breaking Avilov's record,[42] and 8,538 points at the 1976 Olympic trials, also in Eugene.[27][43] The record in Eugene was a hybrid score because a timing system failure and wind aided marks. Still, Jenner was proud of \"A nice little workout, huh?\"\n\"We got what we wanted. We scared the hell out of everybody in the world only a month away from the Games.\"[44]\nOf the 13 decathlons Jenner competed in between 1973 and 1976, the only loss was at the 1975 AAU National Championships, when a \"no height\" in the pole vault marred the score.[25]\nAt the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Jenner achieved five personal bests on the first day of the men's decathlon\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a \"home run\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0despite being in second place behind Guido Kratschmer of West Germany. Jenner was confident: \"The second day has all my good events. If everything works out all right, we should be ahead after it's all over.\" Following a rainstorm on the second day, Jenner watched teammate Fred Dixon get injured in the 110 meter hurdles,[45] so took a cautious approach to the hurdles and discus, then had personal bests in the pole vault, when Jenner took the lead, and javelin.[46] By that point, victory was virtually assured, but it remained to be seen by how much Jenner would improve the record. In the final event\u2014the 1500 meters, which was seen live on national television\u2014Jenner looked content to finish the long competition. Jenner sprinted the last lap, making up a 50-meter deficit and nearly catching the event favorite, Soviet Leonid Litvinenko, who was already well out of contention for the gold medal, but whose personal best had been eight seconds better than Jenner's personal best before the race. Jenner set a new personal best time and won the gold medal with a world-record score of 8,618 points.[5][27][29][47][48]\nOlympic world record performance:[49]\nAfter the event, Jenner took an American flag from a spectator and carried it during the victory lap, starting a tradition that is now common among winning athletes.[50][51] Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: \"In 1972, I made the decision that I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this.\"[29] Jenner explained, \"It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got the rest of my life to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?\"[5]\nAs a result of winning the Olympic decathlon, Jenner became a national hero and received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States and was also named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1976.[4][22]\nJenner's 1976 world and Olympic record was broken by four points by Daley Thompson at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow; Thompson's victory was perhaps tainted by the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, though the top American at the time, Bobby Coffman, was not expected to push Thompson or challenge Jenner's record. In 1985, Jenner's Olympic decathlon score was reevaluated against the IAAF's updated decathlon scoring table and was reported as 8,634 for comparative purposes. This converted mark stood as the American record until 1991, when it was surpassed by eventual gold medalist, and world record holder, Dan O'Brien of Dan &amp; Dave fame.[52] As of 2018[update], Jenner was ranked twenty-sixth on the world all-time list and ninth on the American all-time list.[53]\nJenner was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1980, the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986, the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame and the Connecticut Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, and the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.[54] For almost 20 years, San Jose City College hosted an annual Bruce Jenner Invitational competition.[55][56][57]\nAll information from IAAF[61]\nIn the 1970s, Olympic athletes were considered to be amateurs and were not allowed to seek or accept payment for their positions as sports celebrities. During the Cold War in 1972, three major Olympic titles that had a long history of American success\u00a0\u2013\u00a0basketball, the 100 meter dash, and decathlon\u00a0\u2013\u00a0were won by Soviet athletes. All Soviet athletes were professionals, while the United States was limited to amateurs.[62][33][34][34] Jenner became an American hero by returning the decathlon title to the United States. \"After the Games were over,\" Jenner said, \"I happened to be the right guy, at that right place, at that right time.\"[29] Tony Kornheiser of The New York Times wrote: \"Jenner is twirling the nation like a baton. He and wife, Chrystie, are so high up on the pedestal of American heroism, it would take a crane to get them down.\"[5][30][63]\nAfter the expected Olympic success, Jenner planned to cash in on whatever celebrity status could follow a gold medal in the same mold as Johnny Weissmuller and Sonja Henie, who had become major movie stars following their gold medals. This would require forgoing any future Olympic competition. At the time, Jenner's agent George Wallach felt there was a four-year window\u00a0\u2013\u00a0until the next Olympics\u00a0\u2013\u00a0upon which to capitalize. Wallach reported that Jenner was being considered for the role of Superman, which ultimately went to Christopher Reeve. \"I really don't know how many offers we have,\" Wallach claimed. \"There are still unopened telegrams back at the hotel and you just can't believe the offers that poured in during the first two days.\"[64]\nJenner appeared on the cover of the August 9, 1976, issue of Sports Illustrated,[65] the February 1979 issue of Gentleman's Quarterly,[66] and on the cover of Playgirl magazine.[7] Jenner became a spokesperson for Tropicana, Minolta, and Buster Brown shoes.[29] Jenner was also selected by the Kansas City Kings with the 139th overall pick in the seventh round of the 1977 NBA draft despite not having played basketball since high school.[67] The publicity stunt was executed by team president/general manager Joe Axelson to mock the Kansas City Chiefs' yearly claims that they planned on selecting \"the best athlete available\" in the National Football League Draft. Jenner was presented with a jersey customized with the number 8618, the Olympic-gold-medal-winning score, but would never appear as an active player with the Kings.[68]\n\nIn 1977, Jenner became a spokesperson for Wheaties brand breakfast cereal and appeared in a photograph on the cover of the cereal box. After taking over from Olympic champion Bob Richards, Jenner was second in a succession of athletes featured as spokespersons for the brand. Mary Lou Retton succeeded Jenner in 1984.[71]\nOn November 22, 1977, Jenner went to San Francisco to refute charges filed by San Francisco district attorney Joseph Freitas that General Mills\u2014the maker of Wheaties\u2014had engaged in deceptive advertising in its campaign that featured Jenner. Jenner liked Wheaties and ate the breakfast cereal two or three times a week, which supported the advertising campaign's claims. Two days later, Freitas withdrew the suit, saying that it was \"a case of overzealousness\" on the part of his staff.[72]\nWhen Jenner came out as a trans woman in 2015, General Mills stated that: \"Bruce Jenner continues to be a respected member of Team Wheaties.\" After a negative response to this initial statement, Mike Siemienas, General Mills's brand media relations manager, clarified it by saying: \"Bruce Jenner has been a respected member of Team Wheaties, and Caitlyn Jenner will continue to be.\"[73]\nThe comedy Can't Stop the Music (1980) was Jenner's only theatrical release until 2011. Jenner had some success with a television career, starring in the made-for-TV movies The Golden Moment: An Olympic Love Story[74] (1980) and Grambling's White Tiger (1981).[75] During the 1981\u20131982 season, Jenner became a semi-regular cast member in the police series CHiPs, guest-starring as Officer Steve McLeish for six episodes, substituting for star Erik Estrada, who was locked in a contract dispute with NBC and MGM.[3] Jenner also appeared in an episode of the sitcom Silver Spoons called \"Trouble with Words\", wherein her personal issues with dyslexia were revealed in a storyline about a recurring teenage character with the same problem.\nJenner appeared in the series Learn to Read[76] and in the video games Olympic Decathlon[77] (1981) and Bruce Jenner's World Class Decathlon (1996).[78] The \"hero shot\", the finish of the final event of the 1976 Olympic decathlon, and the Wheaties cover, were parodied by John Belushi on Saturday Night Live, endorsing \"Little Chocolate Donuts\".[79] In 1989, Jenner played herself in the comedy short Dirty Tennis written by James Van Patten.[80]\nJenner has appeared in a variety of game shows and reality television programs, including starring with Grits Gresham in an episode of The American Sportsman.[81] In the early 1990s, Jenner was the host of an infomercial for a stair-climbing exercise machine called the Stair Climber Plus.[82]\nIn January 2002, Jenner participated in an episode of the American series The Weakest Link, featuring Olympic athletes.[83] In February and March 2003, Jenner was part of the cast of the American series I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.[84] She made a cameo appearance in a season-three episode of The Apprentice, which aired in May 2005.[85] She also partnered with Tai Babilonia for Skating with Celebrities[86] in a series that aired January\u00a0\u2013\u00a0March 2006 (they were eliminated during the fifth of seven episodes), served as a guest judge on Pet Star on Animal Planet.[87] In November 2010, a photograph of Jenner was shown in a janitor's resume in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.[88]\nAdditional television and talk show appearances by Jenner include: Nickelodeon's made-for-TV film Gym Teacher: The Movie[89] as well as episodes of Murder, She Wrote,[90] the Lingo Olympic Winners episode,[91] and talk shows such as Hannity[92] and season\u00a01, episode\u00a021 of The Bonnie Hunt Show in 2008.[93]\nSince late 2007, Jenner has starred in the E! reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians along with wife Kris Jenner, stepchildren Kourtney, Kimberley, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian (from Kris's marriage to attorney Robert Kardashian), and daughters Kylie and Kendall.[94]\nIn 2011, Jenner appeared in the Adam Sandler comedy Jack and Jill in a scene with Al Pacino as an actor in a play.[95] Like Can't Stop the Music, the film won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture and swept every Razzie category.[96]\nIn September 2016, Jenner appeared as herself on the Amazon Prime TV series Transparent in a dream sequence during the season three episode \"To Sardines and Back\".[97]\nIn November 2019, it was announced that Jenner would be participating in the nineteenth season of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.[98]\nJenner had a short career as a race car driver in the IMSA Camel GT series (International Motor Sports Association) in the 1980s.[99] Jenner's first victory came in the 1986 12 hours of Sebring in the IMSA GTO class driving the 7-Eleven Roush Racing Ford Mustang with co-driver Scott Pruett. The pair won their class and finished 4th overall in the 12-hour endurance race. 1986 was also the most successful year of Jenner's career, finishing second in the championship to Pruett.[100][101] Jenner commented, \"I was a lot more badass runner than I was a driver.\"[102]\nJenner had licensed her previous name for Bruce Jenner's Westwood Centers for Nautilus &amp; Aerobics in the early 1980s to David A. Cirotto, president of other local Nautilus &amp; Aerobics Centers. She had no ownership in the licensed name centers,[31] which were solely owned by Cirotto.[103] Jenner's company, Bruce Jenner Aviation, sells aircraft supplies to executives and corporations.[31] Jenner was the business development vice president for a staffing industry software application known as JennerNet, which was based on Lotus Domino technology.[104]\nIn March 2016, Jenner announced that she had been chosen as the face of H&amp;M Sport.[105] Later that year, H&amp;M created a six-minute film featuring Jenner, called Caitlyn Jenner's Greatest Victories: A Timeline.[106]\nIn a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in April 2015, Jenner came out as a trans woman, saying that she had dealt with gender dysphoria since her youth and that, \"for all intents and purposes, I'm a woman.\" Jenner cross-dressed for many years and took hormone replacement therapy but stopped after her romance with Kris Kardashian became more serious, leading to marriage in 1991.[108][109][110] Jenner recounts having permission to explore her gender identity on her own travels but not when they were coupled, and that not knowing the best way to talk about the many issues contributed to the deterioration of the 23-year-long marriage, which ended formally in 2015.[110]\nJenner has undergone cosmetic surgery, and completed sex reassignment surgery in January 2017.[9] She said she has never been sexually attracted to men, but always to women, and that, keeping in mind the difficulty people have understanding the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity, she will identify as asexual for now.[111][112]\nIn June 2015, Jenner debuted her new name and image, and began publicly using feminine pronoun self-descriptors.[113] Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner.[114][115] Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed with the family in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized that there is no one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent first before focusing on her transition.[116] In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.[117]\nJenner's announcement that she is transgender came at an unprecedented time for trans visibility, including legislative initiatives.[118][119] The 20/20 interview had 20.7 million viewers, making it television's \"highest-ever rated newsmagazine telecast among adults 18\u201349 and adults 25\u201354\".[120] The Daily Beast wrote that Jenner's honesty, vulnerability, and fame may have caused \"cheap jokes\" about trans people to \"seem mean to a mainstream audience on an unprecedented scale\".[121] Noting the shift in how comedians treated Jenner's transition, The Daily Beast saw the change as the same evolution that took place in acceptance of LGBT people as a whole when \"comedians finally cross the critical threshold from mockery to creativity in their joke-telling\".[121]\nJenner's emerging gender identity was revealed in a Vanity Fair interview written by Buzz Bissinger. Annie Leibovitz photographed the cover, the magazine's first to feature an openly transgender woman, which was captioned \"Call me Caitlyn\".[122][123] Using her Twitter handle, @Caitlyn_Jenner, she tweeted: \"I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.\" Time magazine declared this tweet the tenth most re-tweeted tweet of 2015, based on re-tweets of tweets by verified users from January 1 to November 10 of that year.[124] Jenner amassed over one million Twitter followers in four hours and three minutes, setting a new Guinness World Record and surpassing United States President Barack Obama, who, a month before, accomplished the same feat in four hours and fifty-two minutes.[125][126] Four days later Jenner was up to 2.37 million followers, with another 1.5 million followers on Instagram.[127]\nJenner was also mocked. Beginning in September 2015, she was depicted on the satirical American animated program South Park, which parodied her supporters' political correctness, as well as her driving record. The Jenner-related episodes were \"Stunning and Brave\", \"Where My Country Gone?\", \"Sponsored Content\", \"Truth and Advertising\" and \"PC Principal Final Justice\" from the show's 19th season.[128][129]\nIn April 2016 during the Republican presidential primaries, Jenner became an exemplar for candidate Donald Trump's opposition to North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act, with Trump saying that Jenner could use any restroom of her choosing at his Trump Tower property. Jenner soon posted a video showing that she had taken Trump up on his offer. She thanked Trump and assured Trump's adversary Ted Cruz that \"nobody got molested\".[130][131]\nIn June 2016, Jenner was one of several celebrities depicted using synthetic nude \"sleeping\" bodies for the video of Kanye West's song \"Famous\".[132] Later that month, an episode of Epic Rap Battles of History was released featuring Jenner, as Bruce (portrayed by Peter Shukoff) and then Caitlyn (portrayed by transgender rapper Jolie \"NoShame\" Drake), rap battling against Bruce Banner (portrayed by Lloyd Ahlquist) then The Hulk (portrayed by Mike O'Hearn).\nIn August 2015, Jenner won the Social Media Queen award at the Teen Choice Awards.[133] In October 2015, Glamour magazine named her one of its 25 Glamour Women of the Year, calling her a \"Trans Champion.\"[134] In November 2015, Jenner was listed as one of Entertainment Weekly's 2015 Entertainers of the Year.[135] In December 2015, she was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of 2015.[136] Also in that month, she was listed on Time magazine's eight-person shortlist for the 2015 Person of the Year,[137] and Bing released its list of the year's \"Most Searched Celebrities\", which Jenner was at the top of, and declared Jenner's Vanity Fair cover the second in a list of \"top celeb moments of 2015.\"[138][139] She was the second most searched for person on Google in 2015.[140] In April 2016, she was listed in the Time 100.[141] In June 2016, Jenner became the first openly transgender person to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. The cover and associated story marked the 40th anniversary of her winning the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon.[142][143]\nFeminist author Germaine Greer called Glamour magazine's decision to award Jenner with a \"Woman of the Year\" award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman could be better than \"someone who is just born a woman.\"[144] Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for stating\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in a BuzzFeed interview[145]\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 that the hardest part about being a woman \"is figuring out what to wear\". McGowan argued: \"We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well fucking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.\" McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: \"Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism.\"[146][147]\nChris Mandle of The Independent stated: \"Jenner has gone on to inspire countless men and women, but her comments, which were made after she was celebrated at Glamour magazine's Women Of The Year in New York were branded 'offensive and insulting'.\" He added: \"People began tweeting the other, harder things women have to deal with, such as institutionalized oppression, abuse and sexual assault\".[148] James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, the only female New York Police Department officer to die on September 11, 2001, returned Moira's \"Woman of the Year\" award, given posthumously. Referring to Jenner as a man, he stated that he found Glamour giving Jenner the same award insulting to Moira's memory, and referred to the matter as a publicity stunt.[149][150] Smith later said that, having supported transgender youth and Glamour's decision to honor transgender actress Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner's \"hardest part about being a woman\" commentary; this proved to him that Jenner \"is not truly a woman. I believe this comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it.\"[151]\nConversely, Adrienne Tam of The Daily Telegraph argued that Jenner deserved the Glamour award, stating: \"What McGowan failed to take into consideration was the jesting manner in which Jenner spoke.\" Tam said:\n[Jenner] also immediately followed up her \"what women wear\" dilemma with: It's more than that. I'm kind of at this point in my life where I'm trying to figure this womanhood thing out. It is more than hair, makeup, clothes, all that kind of stuff. There's an element here that I'm still kind of searching for. And I think that'll take a while. Because I think as far as gender, we're all on a journey. We're all learning and growing about ourselves. And I feel the same way.\nTam considered McGowan's criticism to be over the top, and stated of James Smith's criticism, \"The salient point here is one about courage. We easily recognise physical courage such as saving orphans from burning buildings, or ordinary people putting their lives in the line of fire. It is far harder to recognise mental courage.\" She added: \"Without a doubt, the police officer who died in the September 11 attacks was courageous. But so is Jenner. It's a different kind of courage, but it is courage nonetheless.\"[152]\nSince coming out as a trans woman in 2015, Jenner has been called the most famous openly transgender woman in the world.[8][10][11] She is also one of the most recognized LGBT people in the world and arguably the most famous LGBT athlete.[153] Jenner said that her visibility was partly to bring attention to gender dysphoria, violence against trans women, and other transgender issues.[154] She also sought to promote more informed discussion of LGBT issues.[154] She signed with Creative Artists Agency's speakers department and will collaborate with the CAA Foundation on a philanthropic strategy focusing on LGBT issues.[155] She made a private appearance at the Los Angeles LGBT Center in June 2015, where she spoke with trans youth.[156]\nJenner received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the 2015 ESPY Awards in July 2015. ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt said Jenner was given the award because \"she has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.\"[157] She is the third consecutive openly LGBT person to receive the award following footballer Michael Sam (2014) and anchorwoman Robin Roberts (2013).[158]\nIn October, Jenner presented the Point Foundation's Horizon Award to television producers Rhys Ernst (of the show Transparent) and Zach Zyskowski (of the show Becoming Us).[159][160] This was her second public speaking engagement after her gender transition.[160]\nIn November, Jenner was listed as one of the nine runners-up for The Advocate's Person of the Year.[161] That month she was also listed as one of the Out100 of 2015, with Out calling her the \"Newsmaker of the Year.\"[162] On International Human Rights Day, Jenner discussed transgender rights with Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.[163] In 2016, Jenner was on the cover of The Advocate's February/March issue.[164]\nMAC Cosmetics collaborated with Jenner on a lipstick, called Finally Free, which was made available for purchase April 8, 2016, with MAC stating, \"100% of the selling price goes to the MAC AIDS Fund Transgender Initiative, to further its work in support of transgender communities.\"[165][166] Also in April 2016, Jenner was listed as No.\u00a08 on Out magazine's Power 50 list.[167][168] In May 2016, her interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015 won Outstanding TV Journalism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Newsmagazine at the GLAAD Media Awards.[169]\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Jenner and others told the stories of the people killed there.[170][171]\nIn July 2016, Jenner spoke about coming out as transgender and Republican at a Republican National Convention \"Big Tent Brunch\" for the conservative group American Unity Fund.[172][173]\nJenner's gender transition is the subject of I Am Cait, initially an eight-part TV documentary series, which premiered on E! in July 2015 to an audience of 2.7 million viewers.[174][175][176] Jenner is an executive producer of the show.[177] The show focuses on Jenner's transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends. The show also explores how Jenner adjusts to what she sees as her job as a role model for the transgender community.[178][179] In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016.[180] The show tied for Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.[181][182]\nJenner's memoir, The Secrets of My Life, was published on April 25, 2017.[183]\nJenner is a Christian, leans towards political conservatism, and is a Republican.[184][185] \"I have gotten more flak for being a conservative Republican than I have for being trans,\" she has said.[186] Although stopping short of an endorsement, Jenner said she liked Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, despite Cruz's negative views of trans people.[187] On her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner said that although she does not support Donald Trump, she thinks he would be good for women's issues; she then stated she would never support Hillary Clinton.[188] She ended up voting for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[189]\nIn February 2017, President Trump rescinded federal requirements giving transgender students the right to choose the school restroom matching their gender identity. In response, Jenner tweeted \"Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.\"[190]\nIn April 2017, Jenner said she was in favor of same-sex marriage.[191]\nIn July 2017, Jenner announced that she was contemplating running in the 2018 race for the US Senate to represent California.[192] Later in the month, she condemned Trump for issuing an order to reinstate a ban on transgender people from serving in the military. In her tweet, she wrote \"What happened to your promise to fight for them?\", juxtaposing it with Trump's tweet from June 2016 in which he promised to fight for the LGBT community.[189]\nIn an October 2018 Washington Post opinion piece, she wrote that she was mistaken in her belief that Trump and his administration would support the LGBTQ community and vowed to learn from her error. \"The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president.\"[193] Her reversal came after a Trump administration proposal to restrict the legal definition of a person's gender to that assigned at birth.[194]\nPrior to her public gender transition, Jenner had been married three times, first to Chrystie Scott (n\u00e9e Crownover) from 1972 to 1981. They have two children, son Burton \"Burt\" Jenner and daughter Cassandra \"Casey\" Marino (n\u00e9e Jenner).[195][196] Jenner and Scott's divorce was finalized the first week of January 1981.[197]\nOn January 5, 1981, Jenner married actress Linda Thompson in Hawaii.[198] They have two sons together, Brandon Jenner and Sam Brody Jenner (known as Brody).[199] By February 1986, Jenner and Thompson had separated and subsequently divorced.[200] Their sons later starred on the reality show The Princes of Malibu,[201] and Brody appeared in the reality show The Hills.[202]\nOn April 21, 1991, Jenner married Kris Kardashian (n\u00e9e Houghton) after five months of dating.[203] They have two daughters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner. While married, Jenner was also the step-parent to Kris's children from her previous marriage\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Robert\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who star in Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The couple separated in June 2013, but the separation was not publicly announced until four months later, in October.[204][205] [206] Kris filed for divorce in September 2014, citing irreconcilable differences.[207] Their divorce terms were finalized in December 2014 and went into effect on March 23, 2015, as mandated by a state legal requirement for a six months delay after the filing.[208]\nIn February 2015, Jenner was involved in a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. Kim Howe, an animal rights activist and actress, was killed when Jenner's SUV ran into Howe's car. Accounts of the sequence of collisions have varied, as have the number of people injured.[209] Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, but three civil lawsuits were filed against Jenner by Howe's stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved in the collision.[210][211] Jessica Steindorff, a Hollywood agent who was hit by Howe's car, settled her case in December 2015. Howe's stepchildren settled their case in January 2016.[212] Financial details were not disclosed in either case.[213]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJussie Smollett (/\u02c8d\u0292\u028csi/ JUSS-ee, born June 21, 1982) is an American actor and singer. He began his career as a child actor in 1987 acting in films including The Mighty Ducks (1992) and Rob Reiner's North (1994). In 2015, Smollett portrayed musician Jamal Lyon in the Fox drama series Empire, a role that was hailed as groundbreaking for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television. Smollett has also appeared in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Alien: Covenant (2017) as Ricks and in Marshall (2017) as Langston Hughes. Smollett was indicted on February 20, 2019 for disorderly conduct consisting of allegedly paying two Nigerian-American brothers to stage a fake hate crime assault on him and filing a false police report.[7] Smollett's defense team reached a deal with prosecutors on March 26, 2019, in which all charges were dropped in return for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.[8] On March 27, 2019, it was announced that the FBI would be investigating why the charges were dismissed.[9] Jussie Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California, the third of six children of Janet (n\u00e9e Harris) and Joel Smollett (1956\u20132014).[10] He has three brothers and two sisters: Jake, Jocqui, Jojo, Jurnee, and Jazz, several of whom are also actors.[11] Smollett is biracial;[12] his mother is African-American and his father was a Jewish man whose family emigrated from Russia and Poland.[13] He has said that his father would \"kill you if you called him white\". His father was absent from his life for a significant portion of his childhood.[14] He graduated from Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey.[15] Smollett told his parents he was gay when he was 19.[14] Smollett began his acting career as a child, appearing in the films The Mighty Ducks (1992) and Rob Reiner's North (1994). On television, he starred alongside his five real-life siblings in the short-lived ABC sitcom On Our Own from 1994\u20131995.[16] In 2012, Smollett returned to acting with the leading role in Patrik-Ian Polk's LGBT-themed comedy-drama The Skinny.[17] Also that year, he released an EP titled The Poisoned Hearts Club.[11][18] He later guest-starred on The Mindy Project (2012) and Revenge (2014).[14] In 2014, Smollett was cast as Jamal Lyon\u2014a gay musician who struggles to gain the approval of his father\u2014opposite Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard in the Fox drama series Empire.[19][20][21] His role was hailed as \"groundbreaking\" for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television.[22] Smollett reprised his role in subsequent seasons,[23] and directed an episode of the fourth season in 2017.[24] In February 2015, Smollett confirmed that he had signed a recording contract with Columbia Records and would be releasing an album in the future.[25] Smollett co-wrote the songs \"I Wanna Love You\" and \"You're So Beautiful\" on the Original Soundtrack from Season 1 of Empire album, which was released in March 2015.[26] In June 2015, it was announced that Smollett would guest-star alongside his younger sister, Jurnee, on Underground, which aired in 2016.[27] In March 2018, Smollett released his debut album, Sum of My Music.[28] Sum of My Music is an R&B album that features elements of electronic music and hip hop. Smollett self-released it through his own label, Music of Sound.[29] On April 30, 2019, it was announced that although Fox Entertainment had extended Smollett's contract for the sixth season of Empire, there were no plans for the character to appear during the season.[30][31] Smollett came out as gay during a televised interview with Ellen DeGeneres in March 2015.[32][33] In a 2016 interview with Out, he clarified his sexual orientation by stating, \"If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man.\" However, he stated his belief that openness to love is more important than gender, revealing that \"If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I'm going to love that woman.\"[14] When Smollett's gay character from Empire engaged in a tryst with a female character, Smollett defended the plot development by stating that he and Empire's creator Lee Daniels were trying to create a conversation about sexual fluidity in the gay community. Daniels has stated that while he and Smollett are gay, they both occasionally want to have sex with women. Daniels stated that \"We're showing life on Empire\", in that both he and Smollett were incorporating their own sexual fluidity as gay men into the show.[34] Smollett lives in Chicago.[35] According to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, Smollett pleaded no contest to providing false information to law enforcement in a 2007 misdemeanor case resulting from a DUI stop in which Smollett gave police a false name and signed his brother's name on the summons promising to appear in court.[36][37] Smollett also pleaded no contest to driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit and driving without a valid driver's license,[36] and was sentenced to a fine and two years of probation.[36] On January 29, 2019, Smollett told police that he was attacked outside his apartment building by two men in ski masks who called him racial and homophobic slurs, and said \"This is MAGA country\", referencing President Donald Trump's slogan \"Make America Great Again\"[38] and used their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault.[39][40] According to a statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the two suspects then \"poured an unknown liquid\" on Smollett and put a noose around his neck.[41] Smollett said that he fought them off. Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; not seriously injured, he was released \"in good condition\" later that morning.[38][42][43] The police were called after 2:30 am;[44] when they arrived around 2:40 am, Smollett had a white rope around his neck.[45] Smollett said that the attack may have been motivated by his criticism of the Trump administration[46] and that he believed that the alleged assault was linked to the threatening letter that was sent to him earlier that month.[37] On February 20, 2019, Smollett was charged by a grand jury with a class 4 felony for filing a false police report.[47][48][49] The next day, Smollett surrendered himself at the Chicago Police Department's Central Booking station.[50] Shortly thereafter, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi stated that Smollett \"is under arrest and in the custody of detectives\".[51] On March 26, 2019, all charges filed against Smollett were dropped, with Judge Steven Watkins ordering the public court file sealed.[8][52] First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats said the office reached a deal with Smollett's defense team in which prosecutors dropped the charges upon Smollett performing 16 hours of community service[53][54][55] and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.[56][57][58] On March 27, 2019, it was announced that the FBI would be investigating why the charges were dismissed.[9]",

In 2015, Smollett portrayed musician Jamal Lyon in the Fox drama series Empire, a role that was hailed as groundbreaking for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television. Smollett has also appeared in Ridley Scott's science fiction film Alien: Covenant (2017) as Ricks and in Marshall (2017) as Langston Hughes.\nSmollett was indicted on February 20, 2019 for disorderly conduct consisting of allegedly paying two Nigerian-American brothers to stage a fake hate crime assault on him and filing a false police report.[7] Smollett's defense team reached a deal with prosecutors on March 26, 2019, in which all charges were dropped in return for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.[8]  On March 27, 2019, it was announced that the FBI would be investigating why the charges were dismissed.[9]\nJussie Smollett was born in Santa Rosa, California, the third of six children of Janet (n\u00e9e Harris) and Joel Smollett (1956\u20132014).[10] He has three brothers and two sisters: Jake, Jocqui, Jojo, Jurnee, and Jazz, several of whom are also actors.[11] Smollett is biracial;[12] his mother is African-American and his father was a Jewish man whose family emigrated from Russia and Poland.[13] He has said that his father would \"kill you if you called him white\". His father was absent from his life for a significant portion of his childhood.[14] He graduated from Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey.[15] Smollett told his parents he was gay when he was 19.[14]\nSmollett began his acting career as a child, appearing in the films The Mighty Ducks (1992) and Rob Reiner's North (1994). On television, he starred alongside his five real-life siblings in the short-lived ABC sitcom On Our Own from 1994\u20131995.[16] In 2012, Smollett returned to acting with the leading role in Patrik-Ian Polk's LGBT-themed comedy-drama The Skinny.[17] Also that year, he released an EP titled The Poisoned Hearts Club.[11][18] He later guest-starred on The Mindy Project (2012) and Revenge (2014).[14]\nIn 2014, Smollett was cast as Jamal Lyon\u2014a gay musician who struggles to gain the approval of his father\u2014opposite Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard in the Fox drama series Empire.[19][20][21] His role was hailed as \"groundbreaking\" for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television.[22] Smollett reprised his role in subsequent seasons,[23] and directed an episode of the fourth season in 2017.[24]\nIn February 2015, Smollett confirmed that he had signed a recording contract with Columbia Records and would be releasing an album in the future.[25] Smollett co-wrote the songs \"I Wanna Love You\" and \"You're So Beautiful\" on the Original Soundtrack from Season 1 of Empire album, which was released in March 2015.[26]\nIn June 2015, it was announced that Smollett would guest-star alongside his younger sister, Jurnee, on Underground, which aired in 2016.[27] In March 2018, Smollett released his debut album, Sum of My Music.[28] Sum of My Music is an R&amp;B album that features elements of electronic music and hip hop. Smollett self-released it through his own label, Music of Sound.[29]\nOn April 30, 2019, it was announced that although Fox Entertainment had extended Smollett's contract for the sixth season of Empire, there were no plans for the character to appear during the season.[30][31]\nSmollett came out as gay during a televised interview with Ellen DeGeneres in March 2015.[32][33]\nIn a 2016 interview with Out, he clarified his sexual orientation by stating, \"If I had to label myself, I would label myself as a gay man.\" However, he stated his belief that openness to love is more important than gender, revealing that \"If I fall in love down the road with a woman, I'm going to love that woman.\"[14] When Smollett's gay character from Empire engaged in a tryst with a female character, Smollett defended the plot development by stating that he and Empire's creator Lee Daniels were trying to create a conversation about sexual fluidity in the gay community.

The series was cancelled after one season.[90] Lovato released her third studio album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011.[91] Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R&B and featured less pop rock than her first two albums.[92] Lyrically, Unbroken encompasses more mature themes as opposed to Lovato's previous work, with some songs focusing on Lovato's personal struggles.[93] The album and its stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lovato's vocals and saw a growth in her musicianship due to the songs focusing on her struggles, but criticized the album's \"party songs\" and found the music to be more generic than her previous efforts.[94] Unbroken debuted at number four in the US, selling 97,000 copies in its first week of release; it was later certified Gold.[95] \"Skyscraper\", the lead single from Unbroken, was released on July 12, and was noted for its messages of self-worth and confidence.[96] It debuted at number ten in the US, selling 176,000 downloads during the first week of release, becoming Lovato's highest first week sales at the time.[97] The song also became Lovato's highest-peaked single since \"This Is Me\" reached number nine in July 2008,[97] and it also debuted at number two on the Hot Digital Songs chart.[98] \"Skyscraper\" received the Best Video With a Message award at the September 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and the track was also certified Platinum by the RIAA and Silver by the BPI.[99] The album's second and final single, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was released on January 23, 2012, and later peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 16, making Lovato's fourth highest peaking song at the time.[100] It peaked at number 12 on the US Adult Top 40 chart and number one on the US Pop Songs chart.

At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding.\" She went on to further describe her vocals as \"spectacular.\"[216] On her 18th birthday, Lovato bought a Mediterranean-style house in Los Angeles, California; however, she decided to live in a \"sober house\" in Los Angeles after leaving rehab in January 2011.[217] Lovato started training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 2016.[218] As of 2019[update] she is ranked a blue belt in the martial art, which is derived from jujutsu.[219] Lovato had an on-off relationship with American singer Joe Jonas between 2008 and 2010, but they prioritized their friendship.[220] From 2010 to 2016, Lovato was in a relationship with actor Wilmer Valderrama.[221][222][223] She later dated mixed martial artist fighter Guilherme Vasconcelos until May 2017.[224] Lovato describes her sexuality as fluid, and has said she is open to finding love with someone of any gender.[225][226] Lovato had no interest in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother.[227] She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, \"He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [he's] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do'.\"[228][229] She has written multiple songs about him.[230] Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013, at age 53.[231] After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honor she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.[232] Lovato had suffered from depression, an eating disorder, self-harm, and being bullied before she went into rehab at the age of 18.[233][234] On November 1, 2010, Lovato withdrew from the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert tour, entering a treatment facility for \"physical and emotional issues\".[235] It was reported[236] that she decided to enter treatment after punching female dancer Alex Welch; her management and family convinced her she needed help. Lovato said she took \"100 percent, full responsibility\" for the incident.[233] On January 28, 2011, Lovato completed inpatient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. She acknowledged that she had had bulimia, had harmed herself, and had been \"self-medicating\" with drugs and alcohol \"like a lot of teens do to numb their pain\".[237] She added that she \"basically had a nervous breakdown\" and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during her treatment.[238] Lovato later said that she had used cocaine several times a day and smuggled cocaine onto airplanes.[239] In April 2011, Lovato became a contributing editor for Seventeen magazine, writing an article that described her struggles.[240] In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, Demi Lovato: Stay Strong, about her rehab and recovery.[241] She began work on her fourth album the following month.[242] In January 2013, it was reported that Lovato had been living in a sober-living facility in Los Angeles for more than a year because she felt it was the best way to avoid returning to her addictions and eating disorder.[243] Lovato celebrated the six year anniversary of her sobriety on March 15, 2018.[244] In her 2017 YouTube documentary Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, Lovato revealed publicly that her treatment at Timberline Knolls was not entirely successful, stating that she still struggled with alcoholism and a cocaine addiction in the year following her stint in the treatment centre and further revealing that she was in fact under the influence of cocaine while being interviewed about her sobriety for Demi Lovato: Stay Strong.[245][246][247][248] She stated: \"I wasn't working my program. I wasn't ready to get sober. I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night. Nobody knew.\"[246] Lovato also stated that her drug and alcohol addictions caused her to not only nearly overdose several times, but later began to impact her ability to perform and promote her third studio album Unbroken, referencing a 2012 performance on the eleventh season of American Idol where she was severely hungover.[245][247][248] After her management team had expressed their intentions to leave her, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for her addictions, leading to her move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help her overcome her drug and alcohol problems.[245][248] On June 21, 2018, Lovato released \"Sober\" in which she revealed she had relapsed after six years of sobriety.[249] On July 24, 2018, she was rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after emergency services were called to her home due to an opioid overdose.[250][251] She was reported to be stable and recovering later in the day.[250] Lovato was reported to have overdosed on oxycodone laced with fentanyl[252] and was revived with naloxone.[253] She was hospitalized for two weeks and subsequently entered an in-patient rehab facility.[254] In December 2018, Lovato took to Twitter to dismiss rumors about her overdose and went on to thank her fans, writing: \"If I feel like the world needs to know something, I will tell them MYSELF. All my fans need to know is I'm working hard on myself, I'm happy and clean and I'm SO grateful for their support.\"[255] She went on to add that some day she will \"tell the world what exactly happened, why it happened and what my life is like today.. but until I'm ready to share that with people please stop prying and making up shit that you know nothing about. I still need space and time to heal.\"[255] Lovato is an active supporter of LGBT rights. When the Defense of Marriage Act was struck down in June 2013, she tweeted: \"Gay, straight, lesbian, bi.\u00a0... No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality.\"[256] Lovato later said: \"I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, and I still have a lot of faith.\"[257] On December 23, 2011, Lovato posted a message on Twitter criticizing her former network for airing episodes of Shake It Up and So Random! in which characters joked about eating disorders. Disney Channel publicity officials quickly took action, apologizing to Lovato and removing the episodes from the network's broadcast and video on demand sources after additional criticism (following Lovato's post) on the network's public-relations account.[258] Lovato identifies as a feminist.[259] Lovato spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia about raising awareness for mental health,[260] and also performed at the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence rally in Washington, D.C. in March 2018.[261][262] In October 2019, Lovato attended a free trip to Israel provided by the Ministry of Jerusalem Affairs and private donors[263], where she was baptised in the Jordan River. After posting pictures on Instagram, she immediately received backlash due to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, but later insisted that it was meant to be a spiritual experience, not a political statement.[264] In May 2009, Lovato was named an Honorary Ambassador of Education by the American Partnership For Eosinophilic Disorders.[265] As part of her involvement with Disney's Friends for Change, Lovato, the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez recorded the initiative's theme song (\"Send It On\") in 2009. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 20,[56][266] and its proceeds were directed to environmental charities through the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund.[55] Lovato and Joe Jonas recorded another song, \"Make a Wave\", for the charity in March 2010.[71] She is also spokesperson for the Join the Surge Campaign!, DoSomething.Org and Joining the Surge by Clean & Clear; the latter is a national campaign encouraging teenagers to take action in their communities.[267] Lovato was featured in a January 2010 public-service announcement for Voto Latino to promote the organization's \"Be Counted\" campaign preparing for the 2010 United States Census.[268] In October 2010 she was the spokeswoman for the anti-bullying organization, PACER.[269] Lovato participated in the \"A Day Made Better\" school advocacy campaign[270] and has supported DonateMyDress.org, Kids Wish Network, Love Our Children USA, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and City of Hope.[271] In April 2012 she became a contributing editor of Seventeen magazine, describing her personal struggles to its female teenage audience.[240] She became a spokesperson for the anti-bullying organization PACER and appeared on America's Next Top Model to speak out against bullying.[272] In October Lovato was named the ambassador of Mean Stinks, a campaign focused on eliminating bullying by girls.[273] In May 2013 she was cited for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental-health problems at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in Washington.[274] In late June 2013 Lovato announced the creation of the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program, named for her late father, to pay treatment costs for mentally-ill patients.[232] In August 2013, she traveled to Kenya for her 21st birthday to participate in a program of the international charity organization Free the Children.[275] In May 2014, Lovato was named the LA Pride Parade Grand Marshal and the lead performer for NYC Pride Week for her contribution to the LGBT community. NYC Pride spokesperson Patti Diluigi said, \"Demi Lovato is an amazing role model for today's youth, both LGBT and non-LGBT, for her activism in the area of equality, positive messaging on body image, and level of openness with her struggles. As a community, we're fortunate to have an ally like Demi.\"[276] Lovato has also become the face of Human Rights Campaign's America's for Marriage Equality. For the announcement of the campaign, Lovato stated \"Whether you're LGBT or straight, your love is valid, beautiful and an incredible love. So let's protect love and strengthen the institution of marriage by allowing loving, caring and committed same-sex couples to legally marry. Please join me and the majority of American citizens who support marriage equality.\"[277] On April 2, 2016, Lovato received the GLAAD Vanguard Award for making a significant difference in promoting equal rights for the LGBT community at the 27th GLAAD Media Awards ceremony.[278] As of September\u00a02015[update], Lovato's name appears on the \"Unclaimed Coogan\" list, which is a fund for child actors whose earnings were partially withheld, but which remain unclaimed by the former child performers.[279] In June 2016, Lovato was among the artists that signed an open letter to stop gun violence, created by Billboard.[280] That month, the Human Rights Campaign also released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Lovato and others told the stories of the people killed there.[281][282] In January 2017, Lovato returned to Kenya to participate in working with We Movement to do work with women and children.[283] In March 2017, as a celebration of five-year anniversary of sobriety, Lovato donated money to Los Angeles-based charities, randomly selecting a group of causes based on their work, which included animal, LGBT and adoption rights.[284][285] On March 22, Lovato will be honored with the Artistic Award of Courage at The Jane and Terry Semel Institute's biannual Open Mind Gala, which recognizes those who raise awareness and reduce the stigma of mental health issues.[286] Lovato partnered with Fabletics in May 2017 on limited edition activewear collection.[287] The collaboration was in support of the United Nations Foundation's Girl Up campaign to fund programs \"for some of the world's most marginalized adolescent girls.\"[288][289] On September 23, 2017, Lovato was named a Global Citizen ambassador for championing the mental health of thousands of children displaced within Iraq and other communities.

Outside the entertainment industry, Lovato is an activist for several social causes.\nLovato was born on August 20, 1992 in Albuquerque, New Mexico[9] to former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Dianna De La Garza (n\u00e9e Dianna Lee Smith)[10] and engineer and musician Patrick Martin Lovato.[11] She has an older sister named Dallas;[12] a younger maternal half-sister, actress Madison De La Garza;[13] and an older paternal half-sister named Amber, whom she first spoke to when she was 20.[14]\nLovato's parents divorced in mid-1994, shortly after her second birthday.[15] Lovato's father was of Mexican descent, with mostly Spanish and Native American ancestors, and came from a family that has been living in New Mexico for generations; he also had distant Portuguese and Jewish ancestry.[16][17] Her mother is of English and Irish ancestry.[18][19] Through her father, Lovato is a descendant of Civil War Union veteran Francisco Perea and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico governor Francisco Xavier Ch\u00e1vez.[20] Lovato claims that through DNA testing she discovered that she is also of 16 percent Scandinavian descent and one percent of African descent.[21]\nLovato was raised in Dallas, Texas.[22][23] She began playing piano at age seven and guitar at ten,[24] when she also began dancing and acting classes.[25] In 2002, she began her career on the children's television series Barney &amp; Friends, portraying the role of Angela.[26] Lovato told Ellen DeGeneres that due to her acting career she was bullied so harshly that she asked for homeschooling,[27] and received her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2009, one year early.[28] In 2006, Lovato appeared on Prison Break, and on Just Jordan the following year.[9]\nFrom 2007 to 2008, Lovato played Charlotte Adams on the Disney Channel short series As the Bell Rings.[29] Lovato auditioned for the channel's television film Camp Rock and series Sonny with a Chance during 2007 and got both roles.[30] Lovato played the lead character, aspiring singer Mitchie Torres, in Camp Rock.[31] The film premiered on June 20, 2008, to 8.9\u00a0million viewers.[32] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Lovato's acting skills were underwhelming and that she \"has the knee-jerk smile of someone who is often told she has a great smile\".[33] The film's soundtrack was released three days earlier; however, the music was considered less current than that of High School Musical.[34] It debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, with 188,000 units sold in its first week of release.[35] Lovato sang four songs on the soundtrack, including \"We Rock\" and \"This Is Me\".[36] The latter, Lovato's debut single, debuted at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and later peaked at number nine, marking her first entry on the chart.[37] That summer, Lovato signed with Hollywood Records and began her Demi Live! Warm Up Tour before the release of her debut studio album,[38] and appeared on the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour.[39]\nLovato's debut studio album, Don't Forget, was released on September 23, 2008, and was met with generally positive reviews from critics.[40][41][42] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Demi Lovato might satisfy her 'tween fans but she won't be winning any rockers over with Don't Forget\".[43] The album debuted at number two in the US, with first-week sales of 89,000 copies.[44] Ten of its songs were co-written with the Jonas Brothers.[45]\nDon't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for US sales of over 500,000 copies.[46] Its lead single, \"Get Back\", was praised for its pop rock style and peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, also selling over 560,000 copies in the United States.[47][48][49] The album's second single, \"La La Land\", was cited for its strong rock elements[50] and peaked at number 52 in the US,[49] and cracked the top 40 in Ireland and the United Kingdom.[51][52] The music video for the song was directed by Brendan Malloy and Tim Wheeler.[53][full citation needed] The third single and title track, \"Don't Forget\", peaked at number 41 in the US.[54]\nIn 2009, Lovato recorded \"Send It On\", a charity single and the theme song for Disney's Friends for Change, with costars the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez.[55][56] All proceeds from the song were donated to environmental charities supported by the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund.[55] Lovato's Disney Channel sitcom Sonny with a Chance, in which she played Sonny Munroe, the newest cast member of the show-within-a-show So Random!, premiered on February 8.[57] Lovato's acting ability was described by Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times as \"very good\", and he compared her favorably to Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus.[58] That June, she starred alongside Selena Gomez in the Disney Channel film Princess Protection Program, in which Lovato portrayed Rosie Gonzalez / Princess Rosalinda. The film, the fourth highest-rated Disney Channel original movie, premiered to 8.5\u00a0million viewers.[59]\nLovato's second studio album, Here We Go Again, was released on July 21, 2009;[9] she described its acoustic style as similar to that of John Mayer.[60] The album received favorable reviews from critics who appreciated its enjoyable pop-rock elements, echoing reviews of Don't Forget.[61] Lovato's first number one album, it debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 108,000 copies, and was later certified Gold.[62][63] The album's lead single and title track, \"Here We Go Again\", debuted at number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100, and managed to peak at number 15, becoming Lovato's highest peaking solo single at the time.[64] The song also peaked at number 68 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 38 in New Zealand.[65][66] \"Here We Go Again\" was additionally certified Platinum in the US.[63] The album's second and final single, \"Remember December\" failed to match the success of its predecessor, but peaked at number 80 on the UK Singles Chart. Lovato made her first 40-city national concert tour, Live in Concert, in support of Here We Go Again.[67] The tour, from June 21 to August 21, 2009,[68] had David Archuleta,[68] KSM and Jordan Pruitt as opening acts.[69] Lovato and Archuleta received the Choice Music Tour award at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards.[70]\nIn 2010, Lovato and Joe Jonas recorded \"Make a Wave\" as the second charity single for Disney's Friends for Change.[71] In May of that year, Lovato guest-starred as Hayley May, a teenager with schizophrenia, in the sixth-season Grey's Anatomy episode, \"Shiny Happy People\".[72] Although critics praised her versatility, they were underwhelmed by her acting and felt that her appearance was designed primarily to attract viewers.[73] Later that year, she headlined her first international tour, Demi Lovato: Live in Concert,[74][75] and joined the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour as a guest.[76]\nCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam, with Lovato reprising her role as Mitchie Torres, premiered on September 3, 2010.[77][78] Critics were ambivalent about the film's plot, and it has a 40-percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[79] However, Lovato's performance was called \"dependably appealing\" by Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly.[80] The film premiered to eight million viewers, the number-one cable television movie of the year by the number of viewers.[81] Its accompanying soundtrack was released on August 10 with Lovato singing nine songs, including \"Can't Back Down\" and \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\".[82] The soundtrack debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 41,000 copies.[83] The Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert was reworked to incorporate Lovato and the rest of the film's cast;[84] it began on August 7, two weeks later than planned.[85] The Sonny with a Chance soundtrack was released on October 5; Lovato sang on four tracks, including \"Me, Myself and Time\".[86] It debuted (and peaked) at number 163 on the Billboard 200, her lowest-selling soundtrack.[87] That month, Lovato also announced her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series;[88] she later said that she would return to acting when she felt confident doing so.[89] Her departure led to the spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was cancelled after one season.[90]\nLovato released her third studio album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011.[91] Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R&amp;B and featured less pop rock than her first two albums.[92] Lyrically, Unbroken encompasses more mature themes as opposed to Lovato's previous work, with some songs focusing on Lovato's personal struggles.[93] The album and its stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lovato's vocals and saw a growth in her musicianship due to the songs focusing on her struggles, but criticized the album's \"party songs\" and found the music to be more generic than her previous efforts.[94] Unbroken debuted at number four in the US, selling 97,000 copies in its first week of release; it was later certified Gold.[95]\n\"Skyscraper\", the lead single from Unbroken, was released on July 12, and was noted for its messages of self-worth and confidence.[96] It debuted at number ten in the US, selling 176,000 downloads during the first week of release, becoming Lovato's highest first week sales at the time.[97] The song also became Lovato's highest-peaked single since \"This Is Me\" reached number nine in July 2008,[97] and it also debuted at number two on the Hot Digital Songs chart.[98] \"Skyscraper\" received the Best Video With a Message award at the September 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, and the track was also certified Platinum by the RIAA and Silver by the BPI.[99] The album's second and final single, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was released on January 23, 2012, and later peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 16, making Lovato's fourth highest peaking song at the time.[100] It peaked at number 12 on the US Adult Top 40 chart and number one on the US Pop Songs chart. It also became the longest climb by a female artist to reach No. 1 in the Pop Songs chart history, until 2019, when Halsey's feature on \"Eastside\" broke the record.[49][101] The song was certified triple Platinum in the US; as of October\u00a02014[update], \"Give Your Heart a Break\" sold 2.1 million digital copies.[102] Billboard has rated the song as Lovato's best, calling it \"timeless\".[103]\nIn May, Lovato became a judge and mentor for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, with a reported salary of one million dollars.[104] Joining Britney Spears, Simon Cowell, and L.A. Reid,[105] it was speculated that she was chosen to attract a younger audience.[106] Mentoring the Young Adults category, her final act (CeCe Frey) finished sixth.[107] At the Minnesota State Fair in August, Lovato announced that after a pre-show performance at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards[108] she would release a single by December.[109] On December 24, she released a video on her YouTube account of herself singing \"Angels Among Us\" dedicated to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[110] In March, she was confirmed as returning for The X Factor's third season,[111] with her salary reportedly doubling.[112]\nLovato's fourth studio album, Demi, was released on May 10, 2013. The album features influences of synthpop and bubblegum pop and was met with generally positive reviews from music critics.[113] Although Jon Carmichael of The New York Times found Lovato's transition fun, according to Entertainment Weekly it signified a less-mature image.[114][115] The album debuted at number three in the US, with first-week sales of 110,000 copies, the highest selling debut week of Lovato's discography.[116] It was also successful internationally, charting in the top ten in New Zealand, Spain and the UK.[117] The album has been certified Gold in the US.[118]\nThe lead single from Demi, \"Heart Attack,\" was released on February 25, and debuted at number 12 in the US, with first-week sales of 215,000 copies, the highest first week sales of Lovato's discography.[119][120] The song peaked at number 10 (Lovato's third showing in the US top ten),[49] and was also successful in the UK, Australia, and Europe.[121] The second single, \"Made in the USA\" peaked at number 80 in the US.[102] The third and fourth singles from Demi, \"Neon Lights\" and \"Really Don't Care\", both peaked in the top forty of the US, and at number one in the country's Dance Club Songs chart.[122][123] They were also certified Platinum in the US.[124]\nLovato later released a deluxe version of Demi, which was to include seven new tracks, consisting of four live performances and three studio recordings.[125] One of these songs included a collaboration with Olly Murs on a song for his fourth studio album, entitled \"Up\".[126] Lovato contributed to The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones soundtrack album with \"Heart by Heart\".[127]\nOn June 11, Lovato released an e-book, Demi, on iBooks.[128] She planned to appear in at least six episodes of the fifth season of Glee, but she only appeared four. She played Dani, a struggling New York-based artist who befriends Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and interacts with fellow newcomer Adam Lambert's character. Lovato debuted in the season's second episode, which aired on October 3, and made her final appearance in March 2014.[129] On November 19, she released a book, Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year, which topped The New York Times bestseller list.[130] She then agreed to write a memoir, which has yet to be released.[131]\nShe announced her Neon Lights Tour (including a Canadian leg) on September 29, 2013,[132] which began February 9, 2014 and ended May 17.[133][134] On October 21, she released her cover of \"Let It Go\" for the Disney film Frozen, which was released in theaters on November 27. Lovato's cover was described as more \"radio friendly\" and \"pop\" as compared to the original by Idina Menzel.[135] Lovato's cover appears in the movie's credits, and the song was promoted as the single for the film's soundtrack.[136] The song peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 38, spending 20 weeks on the chart. It was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.[124] On May 18, 2014, \"Somebody to You\" featuring Lovato was released as the fourth single from The Vamps' debut album, Meet the Vamps.[137] On May 29, she announced her fourth concert tour (and first world tour, covering 25 cities), the Demi World Tour, and its first North American dates.[138] In November 2014, Lovato opened the UK shows on Enrique Iglesias' Sex and Love Tour.[139] She also worked with her longtime friend Nick Jonas on a song for his self-titled album called \"Avalanche,\" released November 2014.[140] Lovato was featured on \"Up\", the second single from Olly Murs' fourth studio album, Never Been Better.[141]\nLovato announced her skincare line called Devonne by Demi to be available in December 2014.[142] She released a music video for her song \"Nightingale\" on December 24, 2014.[143]\nLovato's fifth album, Confident, was released on October 16, 2015,[144] and received generally positive reviews from music critics.[145] The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies.[146] During the album's production, Lovato commented: \"I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become.\"[147][148] She further stated, \"I've never been so sure of myself as an artist when it comes down to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do.\"[149]\nIn January 2019, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA, and has sold one million copies in the United States[150].

She was never publicly seen drinking and driving or wearing really scandalous clothes or anything like that. I feel like she set a really great example and she was extremely talented.\"[207] Lovato's The Neon Lights Tour was \"inspired by Beyonc\u00e9.\"[208]\nNick Levine of Digital Spy, commenting on her vocals for her album, Don't Forget, stated, \"she's certainly a stronger singer than the Jonases.

Something not often found in her peers.\"[211]\nFor Lovato's second studio album, Here We Go Again, Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News wrote, \"Unlike so many of her Disney-fied peers, Lovato can really sing...[and it's] refreshing [she doesn't need Auto-Tune] to mask any lack of natural ability.\"[212]\nUpon working with Lovato on her third studio album, Unbroken, Ryan Tedder stated, \"Demi blew me out of the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes.\" He also commented on their work together on the song \"Neon Lights\" from Lovato's fourth studio album, saying, \"She, in pop music, has one of the biggest ranges, possibly the highest full voice singer I've ever worked with.\"[213] Tamsyn Wilce from Alter the Press commented on her vocals on Demi, stating \"it shows just how strong her vocal cords are and the variation of styles that she can completely work to make her own.\"[214]\nIn a review for the Neon Lights Tour, Mike Wass from Idolator commented \"you don't need shiny distractions when you can belt out songs like Demi and connect with the crowd on such an emotional level.\"[215]\nIn a review for the Demi World Tour, Marielle Wakim from Los Angeles Magazine commented on Lovato's vocals, stating, \"For those who haven't bothered to follow Lovato's career, let's get something out of the way: the girl can sing. Get over your fear of being judged by your Facebook friends and Spotify her discography, because you're going to have the last laugh five years down the road (probably sooner) when she wins a Grammy. At 22 years old, her vocal range is astounding.\" She went on to further describe her vocals as \"spectacular.\"[216]\nOn her 18th birthday, Lovato bought a Mediterranean-style house in Los Angeles, California; however, she decided to live in a \"sober house\" in Los Angeles after leaving rehab in January 2011.[217]\nLovato started training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 2016.[218] As of 2019[update] she is ranked a blue belt in the martial art, which is derived from jujutsu.[219]\nLovato had an on-off relationship with American singer Joe Jonas between 2008 and 2010, but they prioritized their friendship.[220] From 2010 to 2016, Lovato was in a relationship with actor Wilmer Valderrama.[221][222][223] She later dated mixed martial artist fighter Guilherme Vasconcelos until May 2017.[224] Lovato describes her sexuality as fluid, and has said she is open to finding love with someone of any gender.[225][226]\nLovato had no interest in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother.[227] She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, \"He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [he's] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do'.\"[228][229] She has written multiple songs about him.[230] Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013, at age 53.[231] After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honor she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.[232]\nLovato had suffered from depression, an eating disorder, self-harm, and being bullied before she went into rehab at the age of 18.[233][234] On November 1, 2010, Lovato withdrew from the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert tour, entering a treatment facility for \"physical and emotional issues\".[235] It was reported[236] that she decided to enter treatment after punching female dancer Alex Welch; her management and family convinced her she needed help. Lovato said she took \"100 percent, full responsibility\" for the incident.[233] On January 28, 2011, Lovato completed inpatient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. She acknowledged that she had had bulimia, had harmed herself, and had been \"self-medicating\" with drugs and alcohol \"like a lot of teens do to numb their pain\".[237] She added that she \"basically had a nervous breakdown\" and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during her treatment.[238] Lovato later said that she had used cocaine several times a day and smuggled cocaine onto airplanes.[239]\nIn April 2011, Lovato became a contributing editor for Seventeen magazine, writing an article that described her struggles.[240] In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, Demi Lovato: Stay Strong, about her rehab and recovery.[241] She began work on her fourth album the following month.[242] In January 2013, it was reported that Lovato had been living in a sober-living facility in Los Angeles for more than a year because she felt it was the best way to avoid returning to her addictions and eating disorder.[243] Lovato celebrated the six year anniversary of her sobriety on March 15, 2018.[244]\nIn her 2017 YouTube documentary Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, Lovato revealed publicly that her treatment at Timberline Knolls was not entirely successful, stating that she still struggled with alcoholism and a cocaine addiction in the year following her stint in the treatment centre and further revealing that she was in fact under the influence of cocaine while being interviewed about her sobriety for Demi Lovato: Stay Strong.[245][246][247][248] She stated: \"I wasn't working my program. I wasn't ready to get sober. I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night. Nobody knew.\"[246]\nLovato also stated that her drug and alcohol addictions caused her to not only nearly overdose several times, but later began to impact her ability to perform and promote her third studio album Unbroken, referencing a 2012 performance on the eleventh season of American Idol where she was severely hungover.[245][247][248] After her management team had expressed their intentions to leave her, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for her addictions, leading to her move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help her overcome her drug and alcohol problems.[245][248]\nOn June 21, 2018, Lovato released \"Sober\" in which she revealed she had relapsed after six years of sobriety.[249] On July 24, 2018, she was rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after emergency services were called to her home due to an opioid overdose.[250][251] She was reported to be stable and recovering later in the day.[250] Lovato was reported to have overdosed on oxycodone laced with fentanyl[252] and was revived with naloxone.[253] She was hospitalized for two weeks and subsequently entered an in-patient rehab facility.[254] In December 2018, Lovato took to Twitter to dismiss rumors about her overdose and went on to thank her fans, writing: \"If I feel like the world needs to know something, I will tell them MYSELF. All my fans need to know is I'm working hard on myself, I'm happy and clean and I'm SO grateful for their support.\"[255] She went on to add that some day she will \"tell the world what exactly happened, why it happened and what my life is like today.. but until I'm ready to share that with people please stop prying and making up shit that you know nothing about. I still need space and time to heal.\"[255]\nLovato is an active supporter of LGBT rights. When the Defense of Marriage Act was struck down in June 2013, she tweeted: \"Gay, straight, lesbian, bi.\u00a0... No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality.\"[256] Lovato later said: \"I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, and I still have a lot of faith.\"[257]\nOn December 23, 2011, Lovato posted a message on Twitter criticizing her former network for airing episodes of Shake It Up and So Random! in which characters joked about eating disorders. Disney Channel publicity officials quickly took action, apologizing to Lovato and removing the episodes from the network's broadcast and video on demand sources after additional criticism (following Lovato's post) on the network's public-relations account.[258]\nLovato identifies as a feminist.[259]\nLovato spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia about raising awareness for mental health,[260] and also performed at the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence rally in Washington, D.C. in March 2018.[261][262]\nIn October 2019, Lovato attended a free trip to Israel provided by the Ministry of Jerusalem Affairs and private donors[263], where she was baptised in the Jordan River. After posting pictures on Instagram, she immediately received backlash due to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, but later insisted that it was meant to be a spiritual experience, not a political statement.[264]\nIn May 2009, Lovato was named an Honorary Ambassador of Education by the American Partnership For Eosinophilic Disorders.[265] As part of her involvement with Disney's Friends for Change, Lovato, the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez recorded the initiative's theme song (\"Send It On\") in 2009. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 20,[56][266] and its proceeds were directed to environmental charities through the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund.[55] Lovato and Joe Jonas recorded another song, \"Make a Wave\", for the charity in March 2010.[71] She is also spokesperson for the Join the Surge Campaign!, DoSomething.Org and Joining the Surge by Clean &amp; Clear; the latter is a national campaign encouraging teenagers to take action in their communities.[267]\nLovato was featured in a January 2010 public-service announcement for Voto Latino to promote the organization's \"Be Counted\" campaign preparing for the 2010 United States Census.[268] In October 2010 she was the spokeswoman for the anti-bullying organization, PACER.[269] Lovato participated in the \"A Day Made Better\" school advocacy campaign[270] and has supported DonateMyDress.org, Kids Wish Network, Love Our Children USA, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and City of Hope.[271] In April 2012 she became a contributing editor of Seventeen magazine, describing her personal struggles to its female teenage audience.[240] She became a spokesperson for the anti-bullying organization PACER and appeared on America's Next Top Model to speak out against bullying.[272]\nIn October Lovato was named the ambassador of Mean Stinks, a campaign focused on eliminating bullying by girls.[273] In May 2013 she was cited for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental-health problems at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in Washington.[274] In late June 2013 Lovato announced the creation of the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program, named for her late father, to pay treatment costs for mentally-ill patients.[232] In August 2013, she traveled to Kenya for her 21st birthday to participate in a program of the international charity organization Free the Children.[275]\nIn May 2014, Lovato was named the LA Pride Parade Grand Marshal and the lead performer for NYC Pride Week for her contribution to the LGBT community. NYC Pride spokesperson Patti Diluigi said, \"Demi Lovato is an amazing role model for today's youth, both LGBT and non-LGBT, for her activism in the area of equality, positive messaging on body image, and level of openness with her struggles. As a community, we're fortunate to have an ally like Demi.\"[276] Lovato has also become the face of Human Rights Campaign's America's for Marriage Equality. For the announcement of the campaign, Lovato stated \"Whether you're LGBT or straight, your love is valid, beautiful and an incredible love.

Elected in 2012, she is the first Hindu member of Congress and the first American Samoan voting member of Congress.[1][2][3] Gabbard's announcement of her intention to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2020 US presidential election made her the first female combat veteran to run for president.[4][5] In 2002, Gabbard was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives.[6] Gabbard served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009 as Army Military Police platoon leader.[7][8][9] She was a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2013 to 2016, when she resigned to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. She supports a Medicare for All health care plan she terms \"Single Payer Plus\"[10][11][12] and strengthening Roe v Wade by codifying it into federal law.[13] She co-sponsored the Family Act for paid family and medical leave and endorsed universal basic income.[14][15][16] Until 2004 she voted and lobbied against same-sex marriage in Hawaii. She publicly apologized for her former positions in 2012, and again after launching her presidential campaign in 2019.[17][18] Since 2013 she has been a member of the LGBT Equality caucus in Congress.[19][20] She opposes military interventionism[21][22] and has called herself a \"hawk\" on terrorism.[23] Her decision to meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and her skeptical approach to two claims he had used chemical weapons[24][25] were controversial, particularly among \"leading establishment Democrats\".[26] Gabbard was born on April 12, 1981, in Leloaloa, Maoputasi County, on American Samoa's main island of Tutuila.[27][28] She was the fourth of five children born to Mike Gabbard and his wife Carol (n\u00e9e Porter) Gabbard.[29] In 1983, when Gabbard was two years old, her family moved to Hawaii, where her family had lived in the late 1970s.[30][31][32] Gabbard was raised in a multicultural household.[33][34] She is of mixed ethnicity, including Asian, Polynesian, and Caucasian descent.[35] Her mother was born in Indiana and grew up in Michigan.[36] Her father was born in American Samoa and lived in Hawaii and Florida as a child;[31][37] he is of Samoan and European ancestry.[38] Gabbard grew up in the Science of Identity Foundation community[39] and fully embraced the Hindu faith as a teenager.[29][40][41] Gabbard's first name comes from the Sanskrit word for Holy Basil, a plant sacred in Hinduism.[42] Her siblings also have Hindu Sanskrit-origin names.[29] She was home-schooled through high school except for two years at informal schools in the Philippines.[30][43] In 1998, at age 17, Gabbard began working for the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values, an anti-gay political action committee her father founded, to pass an amendment giving the Hawaii state legislature the power to \"reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples\";[44][45] she spoke on the organization's behalf as late as 2004[46] and referred to those seeking marriage equality as \"a small number of homosexual extremists.\"[44] In the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Gabbard worked for a nonprofit, Stand Up For America (SUFA),[47][48] founded by her father.[49] In 2002, while working as a self-employed martial arts instructor,[50] she was the youngest legislator ever elected to represent the 42nd House District of the Hawaii House of Representatives.[51][52] In 2004, Gabbard volunteered for Army National Guard service in Iraq and chose not to campaign for reelection.[53] Before her deployment to Iraq in 2004, Gabbard also worked as an educator for the Healthy Hawai'i Coalition.[54] In 2009, Gabbard graduated from Hawaii Pacific University with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in International Business.[55][56][57] In April 2003, while serving in the State Legislature, Gabbard enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard.[58] In July 2004, she was deployed for a 12-month tour in Iraq, serving as a specialist with the Medical Company, 29th Support Battalion, 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.[59][60][61] In Iraq, Gabbard served at Logistical Support Area Anaconda, completing her tour in 2005.[62][63] In March 2007, she graduated from the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy. Gabbard was the first woman to finish as the Distinguished Honor graduate in the Academy's 50-year history.[51][64][65] She was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the 29th Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the Hawaii Army National Guard, this time to serve as an Army Military Police officer.[7][66][67] She was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009.[63][68][69] Gabbard is a recipient of the Combat Medical Badge and the Meritorious Service Medal.[70][71] On October 12, 2015, she was promoted from captain to major at a ceremony at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific[72][73] She continues to serve as a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard.[74] On August 7, 2018, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported that the Hawaii Army National Guard had instructed Gabbard that a video of her in uniform on her VoteTulsi Facebook page did not comply with military ethics rules. Gabbard's campaign removed the video and added a disclaimer to the website's banner image of Gabbard in uniform in a veterans' cemetery that the image does not imply an endorsement from the military. A similar situation had happened during a previous Gabbard congressional campaign. A spokeswoman for Gabbard said the campaign would work closely with the Department of Defense to ensure compliance with all regulations.[75] In 2002, after redistricting, Gabbard won the four-candidate Democratic primary with a plurality of 48% of the vote.[76] Gabbard then defeated Republican Alfonso Jimenez in the general election, 65%\u201335%.[76] At the age of 21, Gabbard became the youngest legislator ever elected in Hawaii's history and was at the time the youngest woman ever elected to a U.S. state legislature.[51][52] During her term of office, Gabbard successfully led opposition to, and protests of, a state bill that would have legalized same-sex civil unions[77][78] and urged Hawaiians to support the Federal Marriage Amendment to prevent federal law from overriding state law with regard to same-sex marriage.[79] In 2004, Gabbard filed for reelection but then volunteered for Army National Guard service in Iraq. Rida Cabanilla, who filed to run against her, called on Gabbard to resign because she would not be able to represent her district from Iraq.[80] Gabbard announced in August 2004 that she would not campaign for a second term,[53] and Cabanilla won the Democratic primary, 64%\u201325%.[81] State law prevented the removal of Gabbard's name from the ballot.[82] After returning home from her second deployment to the Middle East in 2009, Gabbard ran for a seat on the Honolulu City Council vacated by City Councilman Rod Tam, of the 6th district, who decided to retire in order to run for mayor of Honolulu.[83] In the 10-candidate nonpartisan open primary in September 2010, Gabbard finished first with 33% of the vote.[84] In the November 2 runoff election she defeated Sesnita Moepono, 58%\u201342%.[85] Gabbard introduced a measure to help food truck vendors by loosening parking restrictions.[86] She also introduced Bill 54, a measure that authorized city workers to confiscate personal belongings stored on public property with 24 hours' notice to its owner.[87][88] After overcoming opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)[89] and Occupy Hawai'i,[90] Bill 54 passed and became City Ordinance 1129. In early 2011, Mazie Hirono, the incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, announced that she would run for the United States Senate. In May 2011, Gabbard announced her candidacy for Hirono's House seat.[91] The Democratic Mayor of Honolulu, Mufi Hannemann, was the best-known candidate in the six-way primary, but Gabbard won with 62,882 votes (55%); the Honolulu Star-Advertiser called her win an \"improbable rise from a distant underdog to victory.\"[92] Gabbard resigned from the City Council on August 16 to focus on her congressional campaign[93] and to prevent the cost of holding a special election.[94][95] As the Democratic nominee, Gabbard spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina at the invitation of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who called Gabbard \"an emerging star.\"[96][97] She won the November 6, 2012, general election, defeating Republican Kawika Crowley by 168,503 to 40,707 votes (80.6%\u201319.4%),[98] becoming the first Samoan-American[99] and first Hindu member of Congress.[100][101] In December 2012, Gabbard applied to be considered for appointment to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the death of Daniel Inouye,[102] but despite support from prominent mainland Democrats,[103][104] she was not among the three candidates the Democratic Party of Hawaii selected.[105] In March 2013, Gabbard introduced the Helping Heroes Fly Act, seeking to improve airport security screenings for severely wounded veterans. It passed Congress and was signed into law by President Barack Obama.[106][107][108] She also led an effort to pass legislation to assist victims of military sexual trauma.[109][110][111] Gabbard was reelected on November 8, 2014, defeating Crowley again, by 142,010 to 33,630 votes (78.7%\u201318.6%); Libertarian candidate Joe Kent garnered 4,693 votes (2.6%).[112] Along with Senator Hirono, Gabbard introduced a bill to award Filipino and Filipino American veterans who fought in World War II the Congressional Gold Medal.[113] The bill passed Congress[114] and was signed into law by Obama in December 2016.[115] Gabbard also introduced Talia's Law, to prevent child abuse and neglect on military bases. It was passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama in December 2016.[116][117][118] Gabbard was reelected on November 8, 2016, defeating Republican nominee Angela Kaaihue by 170,848 to 39,668 votes (81.2%\u201318.8%).[119] In 2017, Gabbard introduced the \"Off Fossil Fuels (OFF) Act\", which set a target of 2035 for transitioning the United States to renewable energy. It was endorsed by Food and Water Watch.[120] In 2018, Gabbard introduced the \"Securing America's Election Act\", a bill to require all districts to use paper ballots, yielding an auditable paper trail in the event of a recount. Common Cause endorsed the bill.[121] Gabbard was reelected in November 2018,[122] defeating Republican nominee Brian Evans by 153,271 to 44,850 votes (77.4%\u201322.6%). In March 2019, Attorney General William Barr asserted in his summary of the Mueller Report that the Special Counsel investigation had failed to find that members of Trump's 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. In response, Gabbard commented that \"finding the president of the United States not guilty of conspiring with a foreign power to interfere with our elections is a good thing for America.\" She subsequently reintroduced her election security bill, arguing that it would make foreign interference less likely in 2020.[123] In September 2018, Gabbard and Representative Walter Jones (R-NC) co-sponsored the No More Presidential Wars Act, an effort to \"reclaim the responsibility Congress has to be the body that declares war, to end these presidential wars that are being fought without the authorization of Congress.\"[124] On October 25, 2019, Gabbard announced that she would not seek reelection to the House in 2020, citing her presidential campaign.[125][126] Hawaii State Senator Kai Kahele had been challenging her for the Congressional seat. Kahele and the co-chair of his campaign, former Hawaii governor Neil Abercrombie [127] criticized her for missing votes while campaigning for president, especially the vote on Syria; however, her absences were similar to other members of Congress running for president.[128][129] Committee assignments Caucus membership On January 22, 2013, Gabbard was unanimously elected to a four-year term as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.[139] In September 2015 she criticized chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's decision to hold only six debates during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, compared with 26 in 2008 and 15 in 2004,[140][141] and to exclude from all future DNC-sanctioned debates any candidate who participated in a non-DNC sanctioned debate. Gabbard released a statement about the debate controversy in a Facebook post in 2015:[142][143] Following her public criticisms of the debate process, Gabbard was reported to have been either \"disinvited\" or asked to \"consider not coming\" to October 13, 2015 Democratic debate in Las Vegas.[144][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In an interview with The New York Times, she spoke of an unhealthy atmosphere, saying, \"no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door\" in taking the job.[145] Gabbard privately wrote to Wasserman Schultz, accusing her of violating the DNC's duty of neutrality by favoring Hillary Clinton. This letter later became public in leaked emails published by WikiLeaks.[146][147] Gabbard resigned as DNC vice chair on February 28, 2016, in order to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination for President of the United States.[148][149] She was the first congresswoman to endorse Sanders[149] and later gave the nominating speech putting his name forward at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[150] In July 2016, Gabbard launched a petition to end the Democratic Party's process of appointing superdelegates in the nomination process.[151] She endorsed Keith Ellison for DNC chair in the 2017 chairmanship elections.[152] Gabbard was assigned as Bernie Sanders's running mate in California for any write-in votes for Sanders.[153] Shortly after the election, she was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate for 2020.[154][155] On February 2, 2019, Gabbard officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign.[156] CNN described her foreign policy platform as anti-interventionalist and her economic platform as populist.[156] Gabbard was the most frequently Googled candidate after the first, second, and fourth 2020 Democratic debates.[157][158][159] Gabbard did not meet the polling threshold for the third presidential debate in time for the August 28 deadline. The following day, she criticized DNC's qualification criteria, saying that the DNC process of developing those criteria lacked transparency.[160] On September 24, Gabbard qualified for the fourth debate in Ohio in October 2019 after gaining her fourth qualifying poll.[161] In October, Gabbard accused the media and the Democratic party of \"rigging\" the 2020 election, and briefly threatened to boycott the fourth debate.[162][163] On October 14, she announced in a letter to supporters that she would attend the debate.[164] On October 18, 2019, former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was reported to have said that Russia was \"grooming\" a female Democrat to run as a third-party candidate who would help President Trump win reelection via a spoiler effect.[165][166] The media understood Clinton to be referring to Gabbard, which Clinton spokesperson Nick Merril seemed to confirm to CNN, saying \"If the nesting doll fits\"; however, Gabbard has repeatedly said she will not run as a third-party candidate in 2020.[167][168][166] Fellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang,[169] Marianne Williamson,[170] Beto O'Rourke,[171] Pete Buttigieg,[172] John Delaney,[173] Bernie Sanders,[174] as well as President Trump[175][176] and Nina Turner[177][178] defended Gabbard and criticized Clinton's remarks.[179] On January 22, 2020, Gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit against Clinton, seeking damages in excess of $50 million.[180][181][182][183] Standing up for herself and chiding CNN for Russian remarks made by Bakari Sellers seemed to have led CNN to snub Gabbard in all of their town hall events leading into the New Hampshire primary, despite polling higher than several other attendees. Gabbard said that her campaign has reached out several times but, \"I don't even think we've gotten a response to date about why they're excluding the first female combat veteran ever to run for president, the only woman of color in the race.\"[184] Gabbard's political positions are broadly similar to those of other 2020 Democratic primary contenders on healthcare, climate, education, infrastructure, and criminal justice reform. But she has distinguishable positions on issues ranging from Democratic Party internal politics to foreign affairs.[citation needed] Gabbard says that domestic and military budgeting issues are intertwined.[185] She criticizes what she describes as a push by the \"neoliberal/neoconservative war machine\" for US involvement in \"counterproductive, wasteful foreign wars\", saying they have not made the United States any safer.[186] Instead, Gabbard says that the policy of escalating tensions has started a New Cold War and nuclear arms race.[187] She has said that the money spent on war should be redirected to serve health care, infrastructure, and other domestic priorities. Nevertheless, she describes herself as both a hawk and a dove.[188] Her domestic policy platform in her campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination is economically and socially progressive.[189][190][191] Gabbard has been outspoken against a \"broken criminal justice system\" that puts \"people in prison for smoking marijuana\" while allowing pharmaceutical corporations responsible for \"opioid-related deaths of thousands to walk away scot-free with their coffers full\".[192] Gabbard has stated that as president she would \"end the failed war on drugs, legalize marijuana, end cash bail, and ban private prisons\".[193] Bills she has introduced include the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act and the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act.[194][195] Gabbard protested the construction of the final leg of the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016.[196][197] Gabbard has spoken in favor of a Green New Deal but expressed concerns about vagueness in some proposed versions of the legislation[198] and its inclusion of nuclear energy.[199] She advocates her own Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act (\"OFF Act\") as legislation to transition the United States to clean renewable energy.[200][201] On January 18, 2017, Gabbard went on a one-week \"fact-finding mission\" to Syria and Lebanon, during which Gabbard met various political and religious leaders from Syria and Lebanon as well as regular citizens from both sides of the war, and also had two unplanned meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[202][203][204][205] In April 2017 Gabbard expressed skepticism about claims that Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in Khan Shaykhun and which were followed by a military attack against Syria by the United States. Gabbard said, \"a successful prosecution of Assad (at the International Criminal Court) w[ould] require collection of evidence from the scene of the incident\" and that she \"support[ed] the United Nations\u2019 efforts in this regard\".[24][25][206][207] In a 2018 interview with The Nation, Gabbard said the United States had \"been waging a regime change war in Syria since 2011.\"[208] Gabbard has called Assad \"\u2026 a brutal dictator. Just like Saddam Hussein.\"[209] Gabbard also criticized the Obama Administration for \"refusing\" to say that \"Islamic extremists\" are waging a war against the United States.[210] On December 20, 2019, the Stop Arming Terrorists Act[211][212] that she introduced in 2017[213] became law as part of National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, \u00a7 1228[214] to prohibit the Department of Defense from \"knowingly providing weapons or any other form of support to Al Qaeda\" or other terrorist groups or any individual or group affiliated with any such organization.[215] Gabbard was a five-year \"term member\"[216] of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).[217][218] When asked about her involvement in it, she said that while many in CFR did not share her worldview, \"If we only sit in rooms with people who we agree with, then we won\u2019t be able to bring about the kind of change that we need to see.\"[219] The U.S. military's 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike, which killed the high-level Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, brought strong reactions from around the world. Gabbard called the airstrike an act of war by President Trump and a violation of the U.S. Constitution because the president does not have Congressional authorization for this act.[220] Gabbard supports a national healthcare insurance program that covers uninsured as well as under-insured people[221] and allows supplemental but not duplicative private insurance.[201] She has called for addressing the national nursing shortage[222] and supports clear GMO labeling,[223][224] voting in 2016 against a GMO-labeling bill she said was too weak.[225] Gabbard voted \"present\" when the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump in December 2019. In two video messages[226][227] and a press release she cited The Federalist Papers essay No. 69[228] and described her vote as a protest against \"a political zero-sum game\".[229][230] Gabbard introduced H. Res. 766,[231][232] which would censure Trump for several of his foreign policy decisions and \"send a strong message to this president and future presidents that their abuses of power will not go unchecked, while leaving the question of removing Trump from office to the voters to decide.\"[233] A week later Gabbard said she had serious concern that the impeachment would increase the likelihood that her party would lose the presidential election and its majority in the House of Representatives.[234] In 1998 Gabbard supported her father's successful campaign to amend the Constitution of Hawaii to give lawmakers the power to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples.[19][18] As a Hawaii state legislator in 2004, Gabbard opposed and protested against Hawaii House Bill 1024, which would have established legal parity between same-sex couples in civil unions and married straight couples. The bill was defeated.[235][236][237] In 2012, Gabbard apologized for her \"anti-gay advocacy\".[17] After launching her presidential campaign in 2019, she apologized again and said that her views were changed by her experience in the military \"with LGBTQ service members both here at home and while deployed\".[238][239] She has been a member of the House LGBT Equality Caucus during her first,[240] third,[241] and fourth[242] terms in Congress, and received a 100% rating in her third term (improving from 88% and 92% in her previous two terms) for pro-LGBT legislation from the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for LGBT rights.[20] Gabbard is vegan[243] and, as a Hindu, follows Gaudiya Vaishnavism.[43] She describes herself as a karma yogi.[244] She values the Bhagavad Gita as a spiritual guide[245] and took the oath of office in 2013 using her personal copy,[246] which she gave to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a visit to India the following year.[247] In 2002, she married Eduardo Tamayo.[248][249] They divorced in 2006, citing \"the stresses war places on military spouses and families\" as a reason for their divorce.[235] In 2015, Gabbard married freelance cinematographer and editor Abraham Williams, the son of her Honolulu office manager, in a traditional Vedic wedding ceremony, wearing blue silk.[30][250][251] On November 25, 2013, Gabbard received the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award at a ceremony at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government for her efforts on behalf of veterans.[252] On March 26, 2014, Elle honored Gabbard, with others, at the Italian Embassy in the United States during its annual \"Women in Washington Power List.\"[253] On July 15, 2015, Gabbard received the Friend of the National Parks Award from the National Parks Conservation Association.[254]",

Elected in 2012, she is the first Hindu member of Congress and the first American Samoan voting member of Congress.[1][2][3] Gabbard's announcement of her intention to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2020 US presidential election made her the first female combat veteran to run for president.[4][5]\nIn 2002, Gabbard was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives.[6] Gabbard served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009 as Army Military Police platoon leader.[7][8][9] She was a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2013 to 2016, when she resigned to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.\nShe supports a Medicare for All health care plan she terms \"Single Payer Plus\"[10][11][12] and strengthening Roe v Wade by codifying it into federal law.[13] She co-sponsored the Family Act for paid family and medical leave and endorsed universal basic income.[14][15][16] Until 2004 she voted and lobbied against same-sex marriage in Hawaii. She publicly apologized for her former positions in 2012, and again after launching her presidential campaign in 2019.[17][18] Since 2013 she has been a member of the LGBT Equality caucus in Congress.[19][20]\nShe opposes military interventionism[21][22] and has called herself a \"hawk\" on terrorism.[23] Her decision to meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and her skeptical approach to two claims he had used chemical weapons[24][25] were controversial, particularly among \"leading establishment Democrats\".[26]\nGabbard was born on April 12, 1981, in Leloaloa, Maoputasi County, on American Samoa's main island of Tutuila.[27][28] She was the fourth of five children born to Mike Gabbard and his wife Carol (n\u00e9e Porter) Gabbard.[29]  In 1983, when Gabbard was two years old, her family moved to Hawaii, where her family had lived in the late 1970s.[30][31][32]\nGabbard was raised in a multicultural household.[33][34] She is of mixed ethnicity, including Asian, Polynesian, and Caucasian descent.[35] Her mother was born in Indiana and grew up in Michigan.[36]  Her father was born in American Samoa and lived in Hawaii and Florida as a child;[31][37] he is of Samoan and European ancestry.[38]\nGabbard grew up in the Science of Identity Foundation community[39] and fully embraced the Hindu faith as a teenager.[29][40][41] Gabbard's first name comes from the Sanskrit word for Holy Basil, a plant sacred in Hinduism.[42] Her siblings also have Hindu Sanskrit-origin names.[29]  She was home-schooled through high school except for two years at informal schools in the Philippines.[30][43]\nIn 1998, at age 17, Gabbard began working for the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values, an anti-gay  political action committee her father founded, to pass an amendment giving the Hawaii state legislature the power to \"reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples\";[44][45] she spoke on the organization's behalf as late as 2004[46] and referred to those seeking marriage equality as \"a small number of homosexual extremists.\"[44]\nIn the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Gabbard worked for a nonprofit, Stand Up For America (SUFA),[47][48] founded by her father.[49]\nIn 2002, while working as a self-employed martial arts instructor,[50] she was the youngest legislator ever elected to represent the 42nd House District of the Hawaii House of Representatives.[51][52]\nIn 2004, Gabbard volunteered for Army National Guard service in Iraq and chose not to campaign for reelection.[53] Before her deployment to Iraq in 2004, Gabbard also worked as an educator for the Healthy Hawai'i Coalition.[54]\nIn 2009, Gabbard graduated from Hawaii Pacific University with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in International Business.[55][56][57]\nIn April 2003, while serving in the State Legislature, Gabbard enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard.[58] In July 2004, she was deployed for a 12-month tour in Iraq, serving as a specialist with the Medical Company, 29th Support Battalion, 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.[59][60][61] In Iraq, Gabbard served at Logistical Support Area Anaconda, completing her tour in 2005.[62][63]\nIn March 2007, she graduated from the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy. Gabbard was the first woman to finish as the Distinguished Honor graduate in the Academy's 50-year history.[51][64][65] She was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the 29th Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 29th Infantry  Brigade Combat Team of the Hawaii Army National Guard, this time to serve as an Army Military Police officer.[7][66][67] She was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009.[63][68][69]\nGabbard is a recipient of the Combat Medical Badge and the Meritorious Service Medal.[70][71] On October 12, 2015, she was promoted from captain to major at a ceremony at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific[72][73] She continues to serve as a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard.[74]\nOn August 7, 2018, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported that the Hawaii Army National Guard had instructed Gabbard that a video of her in uniform on her VoteTulsi Facebook page did not comply with military ethics rules. Gabbard's campaign removed the video and added a disclaimer to the website's banner image of Gabbard in uniform in a veterans' cemetery that the image does not imply an endorsement from the military. A similar situation had happened during a previous Gabbard congressional campaign. A spokeswoman for Gabbard said the campaign would work closely with the Department of Defense to ensure compliance with all regulations.[75]\nIn 2002, after redistricting, Gabbard won the four-candidate Democratic primary with a plurality of 48% of the vote.[76] Gabbard then defeated Republican Alfonso Jimenez in the general election, 65%\u201335%.[76] At the age of 21, Gabbard became the youngest legislator ever elected in Hawaii's history and was at the time the youngest woman ever elected to a U.S. state legislature.[51][52]\nDuring her term of office, Gabbard successfully led opposition to, and protests of, a state bill that would have legalized same-sex civil unions[77][78] and urged Hawaiians to support the Federal Marriage Amendment to prevent federal law from overriding state law with regard to same-sex marriage.[79]\nIn 2004, Gabbard filed for reelection but then volunteered for Army National Guard service in Iraq. Rida Cabanilla, who filed to run against her, called on Gabbard to resign because she would not be able to represent her district from Iraq.[80] Gabbard announced in August 2004 that she would not campaign for a second term,[53] and Cabanilla won the Democratic primary, 64%\u201325%.[81] State law prevented the removal of Gabbard's name from the ballot.[82]\nAfter returning home from her second deployment to the Middle East in 2009, Gabbard ran for a seat on the Honolulu City Council vacated by City Councilman Rod Tam, of the 6th district, who decided to retire in order to run for mayor of Honolulu.[83] In the 10-candidate nonpartisan open primary in September 2010, Gabbard finished first with 33% of the vote.[84] In the November 2 runoff election she defeated Sesnita Moepono, 58%\u201342%.[85]\nGabbard introduced a measure to help food truck vendors by loosening parking restrictions.[86] She also introduced Bill 54, a measure that authorized city workers to confiscate personal belongings stored on public property with 24 hours' notice to its owner.[87][88] After overcoming opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)[89] and Occupy Hawai'i,[90] Bill 54 passed and became City Ordinance 1129.\nIn early 2011, Mazie Hirono, the incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, announced that she would run for the United States Senate. In May 2011, Gabbard announced her candidacy for Hirono's House seat.[91] The Democratic Mayor of Honolulu, Mufi Hannemann, was the best-known candidate in the six-way primary, but Gabbard won with 62,882 votes (55%); the Honolulu Star-Advertiser called her win an \"improbable rise from a distant underdog to victory.\"[92] Gabbard resigned from the City Council on August 16 to focus on her congressional campaign[93] and to prevent the cost of holding a special election.[94][95]\nAs the Democratic nominee, Gabbard spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina at the invitation of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who called Gabbard \"an emerging star.\"[96][97] She won the November 6, 2012, general election, defeating Republican Kawika Crowley by 168,503 to 40,707 votes (80.6%\u201319.4%),[98] becoming the first Samoan-American[99] and first Hindu member of Congress.[100][101]\nIn December 2012, Gabbard applied to be considered for appointment to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the death of Daniel Inouye,[102] but despite support from prominent mainland Democrats,[103][104] she was not among the three candidates the Democratic Party of Hawaii selected.[105]\nIn March 2013, Gabbard introduced the Helping Heroes Fly Act, seeking to improve airport security screenings for severely wounded veterans. It passed Congress and was signed into law by President Barack Obama.[106][107][108] She also led an effort to pass legislation to assist victims of military sexual trauma.[109][110][111]\nGabbard was reelected on November 8, 2014, defeating Crowley again, by 142,010 to 33,630 votes (78.7%\u201318.6%); Libertarian candidate Joe Kent garnered 4,693 votes (2.6%).[112]\nAlong with Senator Hirono, Gabbard introduced a bill to award Filipino and Filipino American veterans who fought in World War II the Congressional Gold Medal.[113] The bill passed Congress[114] and was signed into law by Obama in December 2016.[115]\nGabbard also introduced Talia's Law, to prevent child abuse and neglect on military bases. It was passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama in December 2016.[116][117][118]\nGabbard was reelected on November 8, 2016, defeating Republican nominee Angela Kaaihue by 170,848 to 39,668 votes (81.2%\u201318.8%).[119]\nIn 2017, Gabbard introduced the \"Off Fossil Fuels (OFF) Act\", which set a target of 2035 for transitioning the United States to renewable energy. It was endorsed by Food and Water Watch.[120]\nIn 2018, Gabbard introduced the \"Securing America's Election Act\", a bill to require all districts to use paper ballots, yielding an auditable paper trail in the event of a recount. Common Cause endorsed the bill.[121]\nGabbard was reelected in November 2018,[122] defeating Republican nominee Brian Evans by 153,271 to 44,850 votes (77.4%\u201322.6%).\nIn March 2019, Attorney General William Barr asserted in his summary of the Mueller Report that the Special Counsel investigation had failed to find that members of Trump's 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. In response, Gabbard commented that \"finding the president of the United States not guilty of conspiring with a foreign power to interfere with our elections is a good thing for America.\" She subsequently reintroduced her election security bill, arguing that it would make foreign interference less likely in 2020.[123]\nIn September 2018, Gabbard and Representative Walter Jones (R-NC) co-sponsored the No More Presidential Wars Act, an effort to \"reclaim the responsibility Congress has to be the body that declares war, to end these presidential wars that are being fought without the authorization of Congress.\"[124]\nOn October 25, 2019, Gabbard announced that she would not seek reelection to the House in 2020, citing her presidential campaign.[125][126] Hawaii State Senator Kai Kahele had been challenging her for the Congressional seat. Kahele and the co-chair of his campaign, former Hawaii governor Neil Abercrombie [127] criticized her for missing votes while campaigning for president, especially the vote on Syria; however, her absences were similar to other members of Congress running for president.[128][129]\nCommittee assignments\nCaucus membership\nOn January 22, 2013, Gabbard was unanimously elected to a four-year term as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.[139] In September 2015 she criticized chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's decision to hold only six debates during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, compared with 26 in 2008 and 15 in 2004,[140][141] and to exclude from all future DNC-sanctioned debates any candidate who participated in a non-DNC sanctioned debate. Gabbard released a statement about the debate controversy in a Facebook post in 2015:[142][143]\nFollowing her public criticisms of the debate process, Gabbard was reported to have been either \"disinvited\" or asked to \"consider not coming\" to October 13, 2015 Democratic debate in Las Vegas.[144][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In an interview with The New York Times, she spoke of an unhealthy atmosphere, saying, \"no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door\" in taking the job.[145] Gabbard privately wrote to Wasserman Schultz, accusing her of violating the DNC's duty of neutrality by favoring Hillary Clinton. This letter later became public in leaked emails published by WikiLeaks.[146][147]\nGabbard resigned as DNC vice chair on February 28, 2016, in order to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination for President of the United States.[148][149] She was the first congresswoman to endorse Sanders[149] and later gave the nominating speech putting his name forward at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[150]\nIn July 2016, Gabbard launched a petition to end the Democratic Party's process of appointing superdelegates in the nomination process.[151] She endorsed Keith Ellison for DNC chair in the 2017 chairmanship elections.[152]\nGabbard was assigned as Bernie Sanders's running mate in California for any write-in votes for Sanders.[153] Shortly after the election, she was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate for 2020.[154][155]\nOn February 2, 2019, Gabbard officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign.[156] CNN described her foreign policy platform as anti-interventionalist and her economic platform as populist.[156]\nGabbard was the most frequently Googled candidate after the first, second, and fourth 2020 Democratic debates.[157][158][159]\nGabbard did not meet the polling threshold for the third presidential debate in time for the August 28 deadline. The following day, she criticized DNC's qualification criteria, saying that the DNC process of developing those criteria lacked transparency.[160] On September 24, Gabbard qualified for the fourth debate in Ohio in October 2019 after gaining her fourth qualifying poll.[161] In October, Gabbard accused the media and the Democratic party of \"rigging\" the 2020 election, and briefly threatened to boycott the fourth debate.[162][163] On October 14, she announced in a letter to supporters that she would attend the debate.[164]\nOn October 18, 2019, former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was reported to have said that Russia was \"grooming\" a female Democrat to run as a third-party candidate who would help President Trump win reelection via a spoiler effect.[165][166] The media understood Clinton to be referring to Gabbard, which Clinton spokesperson Nick Merril seemed to confirm to CNN, saying \"If the nesting doll fits\"; however, Gabbard has repeatedly said she will not run as a third-party candidate in 2020.[167][168][166] Fellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang,[169] Marianne Williamson,[170] Beto O'Rourke,[171] Pete Buttigieg,[172] John Delaney,[173] Bernie Sanders,[174] as well as President Trump[175][176] and Nina Turner[177][178] defended Gabbard and criticized Clinton's remarks.[179] On January 22, 2020, Gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit against Clinton, seeking damages in excess of $50 million.[180][181][182][183] Standing up for herself and chiding CNN for Russian remarks made by Bakari Sellers seemed to have led CNN to snub Gabbard in all of their town hall events leading into the New Hampshire primary, despite polling higher than several other attendees. Gabbard said that her campaign has reached out several times but, \"I don't even think we've gotten a response to date about why they're excluding the first female combat veteran ever to run for president, the only woman of color in the race.\"[184]\nGabbard's political positions are broadly similar to those of other 2020 Democratic primary contenders on healthcare, climate, education, infrastructure, and criminal justice reform. But she has distinguishable positions on issues ranging from Democratic Party internal politics to foreign affairs.[citation needed]\nGabbard says that domestic and military budgeting issues are intertwined.[185] She criticizes what she describes as a push by the \"neoliberal/neoconservative war machine\" for US involvement in \"counterproductive, wasteful foreign wars\", saying they have not made the United States any safer.[186] Instead, Gabbard says that the policy of escalating tensions has started a New Cold War and nuclear arms race.[187] She has said that the money spent on war should be redirected to serve health care, infrastructure, and other domestic priorities. Nevertheless, she describes herself as both a hawk and a dove.[188]\nHer domestic policy platform in her campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination is economically and socially progressive.[189][190][191]\nGabbard has been outspoken against a \"broken criminal justice system\" that puts \"people in prison for smoking marijuana\" while allowing pharmaceutical corporations responsible for \"opioid-related deaths of thousands to walk away scot-free with their coffers full\".[192] Gabbard has stated that as president she would \"end the failed war on drugs, legalize marijuana, end cash bail, and ban private prisons\".[193] Bills she has introduced include the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act and the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act.[194][195]\nGabbard protested the construction of the final leg of the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016.[196][197]\nGabbard has spoken in favor of a Green New Deal but expressed concerns about vagueness in some proposed versions of the legislation[198] and its inclusion of nuclear energy.[199] She advocates her own Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act (\"OFF Act\") as legislation to transition the United States to clean renewable energy.[200][201]\nOn January 18, 2017, Gabbard went on a one-week \"fact-finding mission\" to Syria and Lebanon, during which Gabbard met various political and religious leaders from Syria and Lebanon as well as regular citizens from both sides of the war, and also had two unplanned meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[202][203][204][205] In April 2017 Gabbard expressed skepticism about claims that Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in Khan Shaykhun and which were followed by a military attack against Syria by the United States. Gabbard said, \"a successful prosecution of Assad (at the International Criminal Court) w[ould] require collection of evidence from the scene of the incident\" and that she \"support[ed] the United Nations\u2019 efforts in this regard\".[24][25][206][207] In a 2018 interview with The Nation, Gabbard said the United States had \"been waging a regime change war in Syria since 2011.\"[208] Gabbard has called Assad \"\u2026 a brutal dictator. Just like Saddam Hussein.\"[209]\nGabbard also criticized the Obama Administration for \"refusing\" to say that \"Islamic extremists\" are waging a war against the United States.[210]\nOn December 20, 2019, the Stop Arming Terrorists Act[211][212] that she introduced in 2017[213] became law as part of National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, \u00a7 1228[214] to prohibit the Department of Defense from \"knowingly providing weapons or any other form of support to Al Qaeda\" or other terrorist groups or any individual or group affiliated with any such organization.[215]\nGabbard was a five-year \"term member\"[216] of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).[217][218] When asked about her involvement in it, she said that while many in CFR did not share her worldview, \"If we only sit in rooms with people who we agree with, then we won\u2019t be able to bring about the kind of change that we need to see.\"[219]\nThe U.S. military's 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike, which killed the high-level Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, brought strong reactions from around the world. Gabbard called the airstrike an act of war by President Trump and a violation of the U.S. Constitution because the president does not have Congressional authorization for this act.[220]\nGabbard supports a national healthcare insurance program that covers uninsured as well as under-insured people[221] and allows supplemental but not duplicative private insurance.[201] She has called for addressing the national nursing shortage[222] and supports clear GMO labeling,[223][224] voting in 2016 against a GMO-labeling bill she said was too weak.[225]\nGabbard voted \"present\" when the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump in December 2019. In two video messages[226][227] and a press release she cited The Federalist Papers essay No. 69[228] and described her vote as a protest against \"a political zero-sum game\".[229][230] Gabbard introduced H. Res. 766,[231][232] which would censure Trump for several of his foreign policy decisions and \"send a strong message to this president and future presidents that their abuses of power will not go unchecked, while leaving the question of removing Trump from office to the voters to decide.\"[233] A week later Gabbard said she had serious concern that the impeachment would increase the likelihood that her party would lose the presidential election and its majority in the House of Representatives.[234]\nIn 1998 Gabbard supported her father's successful campaign to amend the Constitution of Hawaii to give lawmakers the power to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples.[19][18] As a Hawaii state legislator in 2004, Gabbard opposed and protested against Hawaii House Bill 1024, which would have established legal parity between same-sex couples in civil unions and married straight couples. The bill was defeated.[235][236][237]\nIn 2012, Gabbard apologized for her \"anti-gay advocacy\".[17] After launching her presidential campaign in 2019, she apologized again and said that her views were changed by her experience in the military \"with LGBTQ service members both here at home and while deployed\".[238][239] She has been a member of the House LGBT Equality Caucus during her first,[240] third,[241] and fourth[242] terms in Congress, and received a 100% rating in her third term (improving from 88% and 92% in her previous two terms) for pro-LGBT legislation from the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for LGBT rights.[20]\nGabbard is vegan[243] and, as a Hindu, follows Gaudiya Vaishnavism.[43] She describes herself as a karma yogi.[244]  She values the Bhagavad Gita as a spiritual guide[245] and took the oath of office in 2013 using her personal copy,[246] which she gave to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a visit to India the following year.[247]\nIn 2002, she married Eduardo Tamayo.[248][249] They divorced in 2006, citing \"the stresses war places on military spouses and families\" as a reason for their divorce.[235]\nIn 2015, Gabbard married freelance cinematographer and editor Abraham Williams, the son of her Honolulu office manager, in a traditional Vedic wedding ceremony, wearing blue silk.[30][250][251]\nOn November 25, 2013, Gabbard received the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award at a ceremony at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government for her efforts on behalf of veterans.[252]\nOn March 26, 2014, Elle honored Gabbard, with others, at the Italian Embassy in the United States during its annual \"Women in Washington Power List.\"[253]\nOn July 15, 2015, Gabbard received the Friend of the National Parks Award from the National Parks Conservation Association.[254]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nRuby Rose Langenheim (born 20 March 1986) is an Australian model, actress, and television presenter. Rose came to attention as a presenter on MTV Australia (2007\u20132011), followed by several high-profile modelling gigs, notably as the face of Maybelline New York in Australia. In addition, she has co-hosted various television shows, most notably Australia's Next Top Model (2009) and The Project on Network Ten (2009\u20132011). Rose pursued a career in acting from 2008 onwards. She had a small role in the drama Around the Block (2013), and came to global attention for her role in season three of the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black (2015\u201316). She also had large roles in the action films Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016), XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and co-starred in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) and the monster film The Meg (2018). She currently stars in the Arrowverse television series Batwoman as Kate Kane / Batwoman. Rose was born in Melbourne,[1] the daughter of Katia Langenheim,[2] a 20-year-old single mother and artist, whom she describes as one of her role models.[3] As a young child, she travelled frequently, living in rural Victoria, Tasmania, and Surfers Paradise before finally settling in Melbourne.[4] As a teenager, she attended University High School and Footscray City College.[5] Rose is the goddaughter of Indigenous Australian boxer Lionel Rose and the great-granddaughter of Alec Campbell, who was the last surviving Australian Battle of Gallipoli soldier.[6] Rose first joined the Girlfriend model search in 2002, for which she came in second to Catherine McNeil.[6] In 2010, she collaborated with the Australian fashion label Milk and Honey to design a capsule fashion line. The collection, named Milk and Honey Designed by Ruby Rose,[7] includes washed jeans, leather jackets and T-shirts. The clothing line was available in selected retailers in Australia. Rose also released a collaboration collection with street footwear brand Gallaz. In 2014, Rose began collaborating with Phoebe Dahl for their clothing range Faircloth Lane. She has featured predominantly within mainstream fashion titles, including Vogue Australia, InStyle Magazine, Marie Claire Magazine, Cleo, Cosmopolitan, Maxim, Nylon and New York's Inked Magazine. She's been the Australian ambassador for JVC, Australian clothes company JAG and luxury Danish label Georg Jensen. Rose is the face of Maybelline New York in Australia. Since March 2016, Rose has been the face of Urban Decay Cosmetics.[8] In March 2017, Rose starred in Nike's latest campaign \"Kiss My Airs\" celebrating its Air Max Day.[9] In May, Rose was the face of Swarovski 'Urban Fantasy' FW17 Collection launch.[10] In order to land her job as an MTV VJ in Australia, Rose competed against 2000 other hopefuls in a three-week national search, as former VJ Lyndsey Rodrigues moved to the United States to co-host TRL.[6] As part of the competition, she downed 100 shots of beer in 100 minutes against Jackass's Bam Margera, and kissed strangers on a busy Sydney street.[6] However, she enjoyed her job as a VJ compared to her previous job as a model. \"Being a model there is always something they want to change. Whether they want someone a little bit skinnier, a little bit taller, a little bit prettier, but MTV wants you to be yourself ... not censoring anything and not conforming to anything\".[6] In 2009, Rose won the ASTRA Award for Favourite Female Personality.[11] She also travelled to Kenya to \"highlight ... [the] amazing work\" done by Global Vision International.[4] She appeared in the episode \"Media Virgins\", of Australia's Next Top Model, acting as a guest judge,[12] and also worked as a correspondent for the finale of Australia's Next Top Model.[13] In July 2009, Rose along with Dave Hughes, Charlie Pickering, Carrie Bickmore and James Mathison hosted The 7pm Project, an Australian television news talk show produced by Roving Enterprises which airs weeknights on Network Ten.[14] She left the program to pursue her own hosting projects. In October 2009, it was announced that FOX8 had picked up the rights to UK format Ultimate School Musical,[15] which features ordinary teenagers from a school attempting to put on a music production to a professional standard in just six weeks. The Australian version was produced by FremantleMedia Australia with Rose as host,[16] and aired in 2010. Rose also hosted the Foxtel Mardi Gras for 3 consecutive years before becoming an official correspondent for Foxtel for the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. In October 2015, Rose hosted the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards alongside Ed Sheeran in Milan. Rose appeared on the first episode of Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation, representing Generation M alongside comedian Josh Thomas.[17] She was selected in 2008 to act in the Australian comedy film Suite for Fleur.[18][19] She also appeared alongside Christina Ricci and Jack Thompson in the 2013 film Around the Block. Rose credits her 2014 short film Break Free, which she produced herself, for the success of her acting career. In an interview with Variety, she describes how she was not able to get a manager, agent, or audition, so she decided to create short films \"as a way of being able to give myself something to do and to study my craft.\" The film went viral, getting millions of views in a short period of time.[20] In 2015, Rose joined the Orange Is the New Black cast in season 3. Rose played inmate Stella Carlin, \"whose sarcastic sense of humor and captivating looks quickly draw the attention of some of Litchfield's inmates.\"[21][22] Rose's performance was generally well-received by the public.[23] She was also cast in a guest role, as the service robot Wendy, in the science fiction series Dark Matter.[24] In 2016, Rose and Tom Felton lent their voices to the animated title Sheep & Wolves, with Rose as fianc\u00e9 Bianca. In 2016 and 2017, Rose appeared in three action film sequels, XXX: Return of Xander Cage, alongside Vin Diesel, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter as Abigail, and John Wick: Chapter 2, alongside Keanu Reeves; she also played a musical rival in the comedy Pitch Perfect 3, which was released in December 2017.[25] Rose co-starred in the Warner Bros. film The Meg, a shark epic based on the novel of the same name, alongside Jason Statham; the film was released on 10 August 2018.[26] On 7 August 2018, it was reported that Rose had been cast as Batwoman in the upcoming Arrowverse crossover.[27] Her role has been noted as the first openly lesbian lead superhero in television.[28] Batwoman is in production as a stand-alone series on The CW as well, to air in late 2019.[29][30] Rose's casting as Batwoman was met by backlash on social media and generated intense criticism.[31][32] DC Comics, which owns the rights to the longtime comic book superheroine Batwoman, reintroduced the character in 2006 as a lesbian of Jewish descent. Some online commenters criticized Rose for not being Jewish, while the main focus of the scrutiny was the assertion that the fact she identifies as genderfluid made her \"not gay enough\" for the role.[31] Much of the reaction centered around the hashtag #RecastBatwoman, with commenters insisting that actress Ashley Platz from\u00a0Big Legend was more deserving of part.[32] Ruby Rose quit Twitter and deactivated public commenting on her Instagram account following the backlash.[31] Prior to leaving Twitter, Rose released a few final tweets responding to the negative reaction.[33][31] She stated, \"Where on earth did 'Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can\u2019t be batwoman' come from \u2014 has to be the funniest most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever read.\"[33] Rose called for unity between women and minorities, imploring women and the LGBT community to be kinder and more supportive of each other.[33] Rose will also star in the action comedy Three Sisters.[34] In January 2012, Rose released her first single \"Guilty Pleasure\" with Gary Go. In November 2016, Rose released and directed The Veronicas' single \"On Your Side\".[35] She is a supporter of many charities, won a charity boxing match,[36] and has travelled to Laos and Africa to volunteer each year. Issues of concern to her include animal welfare, campaigns for anti-bullying and youth mental health, where she works as an ambassador for Headspace. Known for being extensively tattooed, she showed off her tattoos in a photo spread for Maxim Australia and PETA, as part of the campaign \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\".[37][38] Rose came out as a lesbian at the age of 12.[39] Because of her sexuality, she suffered verbal taunts and physical abuse from her schoolmates, which led to a suicide attempt.[39] She was also sexually abused as a child by a relative,[40] and has bipolar disorder and clinical depression.[39] With regard to childhood gender nonconformity, Rose said she wanted to be a boy while growing up and that she was saving up money to physically transition from female to male.[41][42] She said, \"It was in my mind as something I wanted to do and then I just... didn't. I guess I grew out of it. I even used to sleep on my front because I didn't want to get boobs ever, which I think worked actually.\"[42] She stated that modelling led her to discover androgyny, and allowed her to model with different gender expressions. She recalled, \"I remember being at a yum cha restaurant with my dad and the owner coming up and saying, 'Excuse me, we're trying to work out if you're a handsome boy or a beautiful girl.' It was a compliment and I was shocked, and when I thought about it I actually wanted to be a handsome boy.\"[43] Rose is genderfluid, saying, \"I am very gender fluid and feel more like I wake up every day sort of gender neutral.\"[44] This announcement came approximately a week after she released Break Free, in which she visually transforms from a very feminine woman to a heavily tattooed man. Rose stated, however, that she prefers to continue using feminine pronouns.[45] While if she had to choose a sex, she commented that she would choose to be male, she does not feel like she should have been born with different body parts. Seeing the desire her transgender friends had for transitioning, she asked herself if her need to transition matched theirs, and concluded that she is satisfied being gender neutral. \"I think at this stage I will stay a woman but ... who knows. I'm so comfortable right now I feel wonderful about it, but I also fluctuate a lot,\" she added.[41] In 2014, Rose announced her engagement to fashion designer Phoebe Dahl; in December 2015, they ended their romantic relationship.[46][47] Rose was in a relationship with singer Jess Origliasso of The Veronicas from October 2016 to April 2018,[48] having previously dated in 2008.[49] Rose is a vegan; she suggested that people who want to help address climate change should consider what they are eating.[50] In 2019, Rose underwent emergency back surgery for a spine issue that led to two herniated discs caused by her work on a film set doing physical stunts. She said if she did not have the surgery, she was at risk of being paralyzed.[51] Various media outlets have commented on public fascination with Rose's gender identity, gender expression, and physical appearance, including her tattoos and visual or behavioral similarities to Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber, and a younger Leonardo DiCaprio.[52][53][54] In 2008 and 2009, she was chosen as one of the \"25 Most Influential Gay and Lesbian Australians\" by SameSame, an Australian online gay and lesbian community.[55] The public and media attention increased following Rose's debut on Orange Is the New Black, significantly with regard to heterosexual women commenting on her physical appearance.[52][56] During 2015, she was the fifth most searched person on Google.[57] PETA named her one of three \"Sexiest Vegans\" of 2017.[58] Emma Teitel of Maclean's stated, \"Rose [...] resembles an androgynous Angelina Jolie; she is a rare combination of angular and soft. She is a badass with a permanently arched brow and a Justin Bieber haircut. In other words, she is the lesbian James Dean. And straight women are falling madly in love with her.\"[56] Alex Rees of Cosmopolitan said that everyone was enamored of Rose at the time of her season three appearance on Orange Is the New Black.[59] The media attention resulted in a new, open discourse about sexual fluidity and whether or not sexual orientation can change, with some of the media expressing disapproval toward heterosexual women stating that they would \"go gay for Ruby Rose.\"[56][59] Teitel wrote that many on Twitter expressed skepticism that all it takes is a pretty face to change sexual orientation, and this was accompanied by the argument that saying \"you [can] 'go gay' for Ruby Rose reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice, and is homophobic.\" She felt that it was predictable and ironic that the people most eager to admonish others for expressing their attraction to Rose were a part of the LGBT community, and cited a Jezebel article which commented that homosexuality and bisexuality are not simply identities to show off liberalism, but are rather \"built into a person's biology.\" To Teitel, this response suggested that \"one must either reject the norm (heterosexuality) or embrace it full force.\" She felt the discussion was a wasted opportunity for sexual exploration, which she believes is \"a lot less daunting when labels are malleable,\" and emphasized the idea of \"letting everyone define their sexuality on their own terms.\"[56] Rose acknowledged the public discourse concerning her physical appearance and subsequent debate on sexual fluidity, commenting that, while she thought it was brilliant and was not expecting it, some of her friends found the public affection toward her inappropriate: \"They personally are offended by it, [and are] saying like, 'You can't just choose to be gay. You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.[59] In Entertainment Weekly's 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series Batwoman.[60] She stated that the opportunity to audition for Orange Is the New Black came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in Batwoman, I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman \u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"[60]",

Rose came to attention as a presenter on MTV Australia (2007\u20132011), followed by several high-profile modelling gigs, notably as the face of Maybelline New York in Australia. In addition, she has co-hosted various television shows, most notably Australia's Next Top Model (2009) and The Project on Network Ten (2009\u20132011).\nRose pursued a career in acting from 2008 onwards. She had a small role in the drama Around the Block (2013), and came to global attention for her role in season three of the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black (2015\u201316). She also had large roles in the action films Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016), XXX: Return of Xander Cage (2017) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and co-starred in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) and the monster film The Meg (2018). She currently stars in the Arrowverse television series Batwoman as Kate Kane / Batwoman.\nRose was born in Melbourne,[1] the daughter of Katia Langenheim,[2] a 20-year-old single mother and artist, whom she describes as one of her role models.[3] As a young child, she travelled frequently, living in rural Victoria, Tasmania, and Surfers Paradise before finally settling in Melbourne.[4] As a teenager, she attended University High School and Footscray City College.[5] Rose is the goddaughter of Indigenous Australian boxer Lionel Rose and the great-granddaughter of Alec Campbell, who was the last surviving Australian Battle of Gallipoli soldier.[6]\nRose first joined the Girlfriend model search in 2002, for which she came in second to Catherine McNeil.[6] In 2010, she collaborated with the Australian fashion label Milk and Honey to design a capsule fashion line. The collection, named Milk and Honey Designed by Ruby Rose,[7] includes washed jeans, leather jackets and T-shirts. The clothing line was available in selected retailers in Australia. Rose also released a collaboration collection with street footwear brand Gallaz.\nIn 2014, Rose began collaborating with Phoebe Dahl for their clothing range Faircloth Lane. She has featured predominantly within mainstream fashion titles, including Vogue Australia, InStyle Magazine, Marie Claire Magazine, Cleo, Cosmopolitan, Maxim, Nylon and New York's Inked Magazine. She's been the Australian ambassador for JVC, Australian clothes company JAG and luxury Danish label Georg Jensen. Rose is the face of Maybelline New York in Australia.\nSince March 2016, Rose has been the face of Urban Decay Cosmetics.[8]\nIn March 2017, Rose starred in Nike's latest campaign \"Kiss My Airs\" celebrating its Air Max Day.[9] In May, Rose was the face of Swarovski 'Urban Fantasy' FW17 Collection launch.[10]\nIn order to land her job as an MTV VJ in Australia, Rose competed against 2000 other hopefuls in a three-week national search, as former VJ Lyndsey Rodrigues moved to the United States to co-host TRL.[6] As part of the competition, she downed 100 shots of beer in 100 minutes against Jackass's Bam Margera, and kissed strangers on a busy Sydney street.[6] However, she enjoyed her job as a VJ compared to her previous job as a model. \"Being a model there is always something they want to change. Whether they want someone a little bit skinnier, a little bit taller, a little bit prettier, but MTV wants you to be yourself ... not censoring anything and not conforming to anything\".[6]\nIn 2009, Rose won the ASTRA Award for Favourite Female Personality.[11] She also travelled to Kenya to \"highlight ... [the] amazing work\" done by Global Vision International.[4] She appeared in the episode \"Media Virgins\", of Australia's Next Top Model, acting as a guest judge,[12] and also worked as a correspondent for the finale of Australia's Next Top Model.[13]\nIn July 2009, Rose along with Dave Hughes, Charlie Pickering, Carrie Bickmore and James Mathison hosted The 7pm Project, an Australian television news talk show produced by Roving Enterprises which airs weeknights on Network Ten.[14] She left the program to pursue her own hosting projects. In October 2009, it was announced that FOX8 had picked up the rights to UK format Ultimate School Musical,[15] which features ordinary teenagers from a school attempting to put on a music production to a professional standard in just six weeks. The Australian version was produced by FremantleMedia Australia with Rose as host,[16] and aired in 2010. Rose also hosted the Foxtel Mardi Gras for 3 consecutive years before becoming an official correspondent for Foxtel for the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. In October 2015, Rose hosted the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards alongside Ed Sheeran in Milan.\nRose appeared on the first episode of Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation, representing Generation M alongside comedian Josh Thomas.[17] She was selected in 2008 to act in the Australian comedy film Suite for Fleur.[18][19] She also appeared alongside Christina Ricci and Jack Thompson in the 2013 film Around the Block.\nRose credits her 2014 short film Break Free, which she produced herself, for the success of her acting career. In an interview with Variety, she describes how she was not able to get a manager, agent, or audition, so she decided to create short films \"as a way of being able to give myself something to do and to study my craft.\" The film went viral, getting millions of views in a short period of time.[20]\nIn 2015, Rose joined the Orange Is the New Black cast in season 3. Rose played inmate Stella Carlin, \"whose sarcastic sense of humor and captivating looks quickly draw the attention of some of Litchfield's inmates.\"[21][22] Rose's performance was generally well-received by the public.[23] She was also cast in a guest role, as the service robot Wendy, in the science fiction series Dark Matter.[24]\nIn 2016, Rose and Tom Felton lent their voices to the animated title Sheep &amp; Wolves, with Rose as fianc\u00e9 Bianca.\nIn 2016 and 2017, Rose appeared in three action film sequels, XXX: Return of Xander Cage, alongside Vin Diesel, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter as Abigail, and John Wick: Chapter 2, alongside Keanu Reeves; she also played a musical rival in the comedy Pitch Perfect 3, which was released in December 2017.[25]\nRose co-starred in the Warner Bros. film The Meg, a shark epic based on the novel of the same name, alongside Jason Statham; the film was released on 10 August 2018.[26]\nOn 7 August 2018, it was reported that Rose had been cast as Batwoman in the upcoming Arrowverse crossover.[27] Her role has been noted as the first openly lesbian lead superhero in television.[28] Batwoman is in production as a stand-alone series on The CW as well, to air in late 2019.[29][30] Rose's casting as Batwoman was met by backlash on social media and generated intense criticism.[31][32] DC Comics, which owns the rights to the longtime comic book superheroine Batwoman, reintroduced the character in 2006 as a lesbian of Jewish descent. Some online commenters criticized Rose for not being Jewish, while the main focus of the scrutiny was the assertion that the fact she identifies as genderfluid made her \"not gay enough\" for the role.[31] Much of the reaction centered around the hashtag #RecastBatwoman, with commenters insisting that actress Ashley Platz from\u00a0Big Legend was more deserving of part.[32] Ruby Rose quit Twitter and deactivated public commenting on her Instagram account following the backlash.[31] Prior to leaving Twitter, Rose released a few final tweets responding to the negative reaction.[33][31] She stated, \"Where on earth did 'Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can\u2019t be batwoman' come from \u2014 has to be the funniest most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever read.\"[33] Rose called for unity between women and minorities, imploring women and the LGBT community to be kinder and more supportive of each other.[33]\nRose will also star in the action comedy Three Sisters.[34]\nIn January 2012, Rose released her first single \"Guilty Pleasure\" with Gary Go. In November 2016, Rose released and directed The Veronicas' single \"On Your Side\".[35] She is a supporter of many charities, won a charity boxing match,[36] and has travelled to Laos and Africa to volunteer each year. Issues of concern to her include animal welfare, campaigns for anti-bullying and youth mental health, where she works as an ambassador for Headspace. Known for being extensively tattooed, she showed off her tattoos in a photo spread for Maxim Australia and PETA, as part of the campaign \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\".[37][38]\nRose came out as a lesbian at the age of 12.[39] Because of her sexuality, she suffered verbal taunts and physical abuse from her schoolmates, which led to a suicide attempt.[39] She was also sexually abused as a child by a relative,[40] and has bipolar disorder and clinical depression.[39]\nWith regard to childhood gender nonconformity, Rose said she wanted to be a boy while growing up and that she was saving up money to physically transition from female to male.[41][42] She said, \"It was in my mind as something I wanted to do and then I just... didn't. I guess I grew out of it. I even used to sleep on my front because I didn't want to get boobs ever, which I think worked actually.\"[42] She stated that modelling led her to discover androgyny, and allowed her to model with different gender expressions. She recalled, \"I remember being at a yum cha restaurant with my dad and the owner coming up and saying, 'Excuse me, we're trying to work out if you're a handsome boy or a beautiful girl.' It was a compliment and I was shocked, and when I thought about it I actually wanted to be a handsome boy.\"[43]\nRose is genderfluid, saying, \"I am very gender fluid and feel more like I wake up every day sort of gender neutral.\"[44] This announcement came approximately a week after she released Break Free, in which she visually transforms from a very feminine woman to a heavily tattooed man. Rose stated, however, that she prefers to continue using feminine pronouns.[45] While if she had to choose a sex, she commented that she would choose to be male, she does not feel like she should have been born with different body parts. Seeing the desire her transgender friends had for transitioning, she asked herself if her need to transition matched theirs, and concluded that she is satisfied being gender neutral. \"I think at this stage I will stay a woman but ... who knows. I'm so comfortable right now I feel wonderful about it, but I also fluctuate a lot,\" she added.[41]\nIn 2014, Rose announced her engagement to fashion designer Phoebe Dahl; in December 2015, they ended their romantic relationship.[46][47] Rose was in a relationship with singer Jess Origliasso of The Veronicas from October 2016 to April 2018,[48] having previously dated in 2008.[49]\nRose is a vegan; she suggested that people who want to help address climate change should consider what they are eating.[50]\nIn 2019, Rose underwent emergency back surgery for a spine issue that led to two herniated discs caused by her work on a film set doing physical stunts. She said if she did not have the surgery, she was at risk of being paralyzed.[51]\nVarious media outlets have commented on public fascination with Rose's gender identity, gender expression, and physical appearance, including her tattoos and visual or behavioral similarities to Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber, and a younger Leonardo DiCaprio.[52][53][54] In 2008 and 2009, she was chosen as one of the \"25 Most Influential Gay and Lesbian Australians\" by SameSame, an Australian online gay and lesbian community.[55] The public and media attention increased following Rose's debut on Orange Is the New Black, significantly with regard to heterosexual women commenting on her physical appearance.[52][56] During 2015, she was the fifth most searched person on Google.[57] PETA named her one of three \"Sexiest Vegans\" of 2017.[58]\nEmma Teitel of Maclean's stated, \"Rose [...] resembles an androgynous Angelina Jolie; she is a rare combination of angular and soft. She is a badass with a permanently arched brow and a Justin Bieber haircut. In other words, she is the lesbian James Dean. And straight women are falling madly in love with her.\"[56] Alex Rees of Cosmopolitan said that everyone was enamored of Rose at the time of her season three appearance on Orange Is the New Black.[59]\nThe media attention resulted in a new, open discourse about sexual fluidity and whether or not sexual orientation can change, with some of the media expressing disapproval toward heterosexual women stating that they would \"go gay for Ruby Rose.\"[56][59] Teitel wrote that many on Twitter expressed skepticism that all it takes is a pretty face to change sexual orientation, and this was accompanied by the argument that saying \"you [can] 'go gay' for Ruby Rose reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice, and is homophobic.\" She felt that it was predictable and ironic that the people most eager to admonish others for expressing their attraction to Rose were a part of the LGBT community, and cited a Jezebel article which commented that homosexuality and bisexuality are not simply identities to show off liberalism, but are rather \"built into a person's biology.\" To Teitel, this response suggested that \"one must either reject the norm (heterosexuality) or embrace it full force.\" She felt the discussion was a wasted opportunity for sexual exploration, which she believes is \"a lot less daunting when labels are malleable,\" and emphasized the idea of \"letting everyone define their sexuality on their own terms.\"[56]\nRose acknowledged the public discourse concerning her physical appearance and subsequent debate on sexual fluidity, commenting that, while she thought it was brilliant and was not expecting it, some of her friends found the public affection toward her inappropriate: \"They personally are offended by it, [and are] saying like, 'You can't just choose to be gay. You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.[59]\nIn Entertainment Weekly's 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series Batwoman.[60] She stated that the opportunity to audition for Orange Is the New Black came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in Batwoman, I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman \u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"[60]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007. Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the singles \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\". The former track also sparked controversy for its themes of lesbianism. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco, and was her first record to top the U.S. Billboard 200. It peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with the singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", while \"The One That Got Away\" reached number three on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after Michael Jackson's Bad. In 2012, Perry re-issued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the songs \"Part of Me\" and \"Wide Awake\". Her next record was Prism (2013), which became her second to top the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\". She followed this with 2017's Witness, which delved into electropop and became her third album to chart at number one in the U.S. \"Chained to the Rhythm\" was the album's most successful single, breaking Spotify's record at the time for most first-day streams for a song by a female artist. Perry has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011\u20132019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018. Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (n\u00e9e Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson.[1][2] Her parents are born again Christians, each having turned to religion after a \"wild youth\".[3] Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry.[4] Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry.[5] She has a younger brother named David, who is a singer,[6] and an older sister, Angela.[7] From ages 3 to 11, Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years.[2][8] Her family struggled financially,[9] sometimes using food stamps and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church.[10] Growing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the word \"luck\" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\".[11] Perry primarily listened to gospel music,[12] as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends.[13] While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, \"I pray all the time\u00a0\u2013 for self-control, for humility.\"[14] Wanting to be like her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who let her take vocal lessons as Angela was at the time. She began training at age 9,[15] and was incorporated into her parents' ministry,[3] singing in church from ages 9 to 17.[16] At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday,[3][17] and publicly performed songs she wrote.[9] She tried to \"be a bit like the typical Californian girl\" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. Perry's brother David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence.[18] She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.[19] Perry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15,[20] during her freshman year of high school,[21] and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career.[22] She briefly had music lessons in facilities rented from the Music Academy of the West.[23] Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills.[22] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar.[12] Perry signed with Red Hill Records and recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson, which was released on March 6, 2001. She also went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour[24][25] and embarked on other performances of her own in the United States.[26] While Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics, it was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December.[27][28] Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard,[29] and moved to Los Angeles at age 17.[30] In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.[31] In 2004, Perry signed to Ballard's label, Java, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. She began work on a solo record, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped.[32] Ballard then introduced Perry to Tim Devine, an A&R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. Over the course of the next two years, Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut, and worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, The Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke.[33][34] In addition, after Devine suggested that songwriting team The Matrix become a \"real group\", Perry recorded with them.[35] Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as her record neared completion. After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&R company called Taxi Music.[36] Perry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, \"Simple\", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.[37] She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song \"Old Habits Die Hard\",[38] which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie.[39] In September 2004, Blender named Perry \"The Next Big Thing\".[37] She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single \"Goodbye for Now\" and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006. That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for \"Learn to Fly\" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for \"Cupid's Chokehold\".[40] After Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke in order to add an \"undeniable smash\" to her existing material.[41][42] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to \"Ur So Gay\", a song aimed at introducing her to the music market.[43] A digital EP of the same name was also released that month.[44] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising it on the JohnJay & Rich radio show in April 2008,[45] stating \"Ur So Gay\" was her \"favorite song\" at the time.[46] In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode \"Life's Too Short\"[47] and appeared as herself during a photo shoot that June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style.[48] Perry released her first single with Capitol, \"I Kissed a Girl\", on April 28, 2008,[49] as the lead single from One of the Boys. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it.[50] The track reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[51] \"I Kissed a Girl\" created controversy among both religious and LGBT groups. The former criticized its homosexual themes while the latter accused her of using bi-curiosity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success.[52] One of the Boys, released on June 17, 2008, garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the US Billboard 200.[53][54] The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide.[55] \"Hot n Cold\" was released the following September[56] and became the album's second successful single, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100[57] while topping charts in Germany,[58] Canada,[59] the Netherlands[60] and Austria.[61] Later singles \"Thinking of You\" and \"Waking Up in Vegas\" were released in 2009[62][63] and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.[57] The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009, as a result of her solo success.[39][64] After finishing the 2008 Warped Tour,[65] Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, where she won the award for Best New Act.[66] At the 2009 Brit Awards, she also won the award for International Female Solo Artist.[67] Perry embarked on her first headlining world tour, the Hello Katy Tour, from January to November 2009 to support One of the Boys.[68] On August 4, 2009, she performed as opening act for one date of No Doubt's Summer Tour 2009.[69] Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009, becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies of the European awards.[70] On July 22, 2009, Perry recorded a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys as well as one new song, \"Brick by Brick\", and a cover of Fountains of Wayne's \"Hackensack\".[71] It was released on November 17, 2009.[72] Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists; she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song \"Starstrukk\" in September 2009,[73] and on a duet with Timbaland entitled \"If We Ever Meet Again\", from his album Shock Value II, in January 2010.[74][75] The Guinness World Records recognized her in its 2010 edition as the \"Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist\", for digital single sales of over two million copies.[76] After her relationship with Travis McCoy ended in December 2008,[77] Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film.[78] She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[79] The couple became engaged on December 31, 2009, while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.[80] After serving as a guest judge on American Idol,[81] Perry released \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg on May 7, 2010.[82] The song was the lead single from her third studio album, Teenage Dream, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June.[83] She also served as a guest judge on British The X Factor later that month[84] before releasing the album's second single, \"Teenage Dream\", in July.[85] \"Teenage Dream\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September.[86] Released on August 24, 2010,[87] Teenage Dream debuted at number one on the Billboard 200,[88] and received mixed reviews from music critics.[89] It has since sold 6 million copies worldwide.[90] Teenage Dream would go on to win the 2011 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[91] In October, \"Firework\" was released as the album's third single.[92] It became the album's third consecutive number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 8, 2010.[93] \"E.T.\" featuring Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream on February 16, 2011.[94] It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, making Teenage Dream the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the chart.[95] \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" followed as the fifth single in June,[96] and Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number-one Billboard Hot 100 songs from one album when the single topped that chart on August 17, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his album Bad.[97] For this record, she received an honorary American Music Award in November 2011[98] and a 2013 Guinness World Record.[99] On September 7, she set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100.[100] After \"The One That Got Away\" was released as the album's sixth single in October, Teenage Dream became the third album to spawn six top-five songs on the Billboard Hot 100 after Rhythm Nation 1814 by Janet Jackson and Faith by George Michael.[101][102] The song peaked at number three in the US[103] and number two in Canada.[59] On January 5, 2012, Perry was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan.[104] That month, she became the first artist to have four songs sell over 5 million digital units when \"E.T.\" reached that mark along with \"Firework\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Hot N Cold\".[105] On February 13, Capitol released the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, \"Part of Me\", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart.[106] Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23.[107] \"Wide Awake\" was released on May 22 as the re-release's second single,[108] peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100[103] and number one in Canada[59] and New Zealand.[109] Perry embarked on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, in support of Teenage Dream[68] from February 2011 to January 2012.[110] The tour grossed $59.5 million globally[111] and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards.[112] On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John and Rihanna.[113] In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street. After her scene was uploaded to YouTube, viewers criticized Perry's exposed cleavage. Four days before the scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that the segment would not air on television, but would still be available to watch online.[114] Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.[115] In December 2010, Perry played Moe Szyslak's girlfriend in the live-action segment from a Christmas episode of The Simpsons titled \"The Fight Before Christmas\".[116][117] In February 2011, she made a guest appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Oh Honey\", playing a woman known as Honey.[118] The role won her the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Guest Star in January 2012.[119] She made her film debut in the 3D family motion picture The Smurfs as Smurfette on July 29, 2011. The film was a financial success worldwide,[120] while critics gave mostly negative reviews.[121] She hosted Saturday Night Live on December 10, 2011, with Robyn as the episode's musical guest. Perry's work on the episode received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised her performance in the episode's digital short featuring her and Andy Samberg.[122] In March 2012, she guest starred as a prison security guard named Rikki on the Raising Hope episode \"Single White Female Role Model\".[123] On July 5, 2012, Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was released to theaters through Paramount Pictures.[124][125] The film received positive reviews[126] and grossed $32.7 million worldwide at the box office.[127] Perry began to venture into business when she endorsed her first fragrance, Purr, in November 2010. Her second fragrance, Meow!, was released in December 2011. Both perfumes were released through Nordstrom department stores.[128][129] Electronic Arts recruited her to promote their new expansion pack for The Sims 3: Showtime,[130] before releasing a separate stuff pack featuring Perry-inspired furniture, outfits, and hairstyles, titled The Sims 3: Katy Perry's Sweet Treats, in June 2012.[131] The following month, she became the spokesperson and ambassador for Popchips and made an investment in the company.[132] Billboard dubbed her as their \"Woman of the Year\" for 2012.[133] She married Russell Brand on October 23, 2010, in a traditional Hindu ceremony near the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in Rajasthan, India.[134] Brand announced on December 30, 2011, that they were divorcing after 14 months of marriage.[135] Perry later stated that conflicting career schedules and his desire to have children before she was ready led to the end of their marriage[136] and that he never spoke to her again after sending a text message that he was divorcing her,[137] while Brand asserted that he divorced her due to her commercial success and reluctance to engage in activism.[138] She was initially distraught over their divorce, and said that she contemplated suicide.[139][140] After the marriage ended in 2012,[141] Perry began a relationship with singer John Mayer that August.[142] In November 2012, Perry began work on her fourth album, Prism.[143][139] She told Billboard, \"I know exactly the record I want to make next. I know the artwork, the coloring and the tone\" and \"I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality.\"[144] After initially telling L'Uomo Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to have \"darker elements\" in Prism following the end of her marriage, the singer revealed to MTV during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards that she changed the album's direction after periods of self-reflection. Perry commented \"I felt very prismatic\", which inspired the album's name.[145][146] \"Roar\" was released as the lead single from Prism on August 10, 2013.[147] It was promoted at the MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[148][149] \"Unconditionally\" followed as the second single from Prism on October 16, 2013,[150] and peaked at number 14 in the United States.[151] Prism was released on October 18, 2013, and has sold 4 million copies as of August 2015.[152] It received favorable reviews from critics[143] and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.[153] Four days later, Perry performed the songs from the album at the iHeartRadio Theater in Los Angeles.[154] \"Dark Horse\" with Juicy J was released as the album's third single in December, and became her ninth U.S. number-one single the following month.[155][156] In 2014, \"Birthday\" and \"This Is How We Do\" respectively followed as the album's fourth and fifth singles,[157][158] and reached the top 25 on the Hot 100.[57] Prior to ending her relationship with Mayer in February 2014,[159][160] she recorded and co-wrote a duet with him titled \"Who You Love\" for his album Paradise Valley. The song was released on August 12, 2013.[161] Perry's third headlining tour, the Prismatic World Tour, began in May 2014[110] and concluded in October 2015.[152] It sold almost 2 million tickets and grossed $204.3 million worldwide[162] and won Perry the award for \"Top Package\" at the 2014 Billboard Touring Awards.[163] She also performed at the 2015 Rock in Rio festival on September 27, 2015.[164] On November 23, 2014, the NFL announced that Perry would perform at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show on February 1, 2015.[165] Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott served as special guests for the show.[166] Her performance was critically acclaimed,[167] and the Guinness World Records announced two days after the singer's halftime show that it garnered 118.5 million viewers in the United States, becoming the most watched and highest rated show in Super Bowl history. The viewership was higher than the game itself, which was viewed by an audience of 114.4 million.[168] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) ranked her fifth on the list of Top Global Recording Artists of 2013.[169] On June 26, 2014, she was declared the Top Certified Digital Artist Ever by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for certified sales of 72 million digital singles in the United States.[170][171] In May 2014, a portrait of Perry by painter Mark Ryden was featured in his exhibition \"The Gay 90s\", and shown at the Kohn Gallery in Los Angeles. Along with several other artists, she also recorded a cover version of the song \"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)\" on a limited-edition concept album titled The Gay Nineties Old Tyme Music: Daisy Bell to accompany the exhibition.[172] That month, a portrait of Perry by artist Will Cotton was included in the United States National Portrait Gallery.[173] On November 23, 2015, Perry starred in H&M's holiday advertising campaign, for which she wrote and recorded a song titled \"Every Day Is a Holiday\".[174][175] On June 17, 2014, Perry announced that she had founded her own record label under Capitol Records, titled Metamorphosis Music. Ferras was the first artist to get signed to her label, and Perry served as an executive producer on his self-titled EP. She also recorded a duet with him on the EP, titled \"Legends Never Die\".[176] The label was later renamed Unsub Records.[177] Outside of her music career, Perry reprised her role as Smurfette in The Smurfs 2, which was released in theaters on July 31, 2013.[178] Like its predecessor, The Smurfs 2 was a financial success[179] but was panned by critics.[180] In March 2014, she made a guest appearance playing herself in the episode \"Blisteritos Presents Dad Academy Graduation Congraduritos Red Carpet Viewing Party\" of the Kroll Show.[181] Killer Queen was released as her third fragrance in August 2013 through Coty, Inc.[182] In January 2014, she became a guest curator of Madonna's Art for Freedom initiative.[183] In March 2015, she appeared in Brand: A Second Coming, a documentary following her ex-husband Russell Brand's transition from comedy work to activism,[138] and released a concert film titled Katy Perry: The Prismatic World Tour through Epix, which took place during her tour of the same name.[125] Perry also made a cameo appearance in the music video for Madonna's song \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" in June 2015.[184] The following month, she released another fragrance with Coty, entitled Mad Potion.[185] In September 2015, she appeared in the documentaries Katy Perry: Making of the Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show, which followed Perry's preparation for her Super Bowl performance,[186] and Jeremy Scott: The People's Designer, which followed the life and career of designer Jeremy Scott.[187] Perry released a mobile app titled Katy Perry Pop in December 2015 through Glu Mobile where her character helps players become famous musicians.[188] She described it as \"the most fun, colorful world that helps guide your musical dreams\".[189] Perry started writing songs for her new album in June 2016,[190] and recorded an anthem for NBC Sports's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics titled \"Rise\", which was released the following month. Perry chose to release it as a standalone track rather than save it for her album \"because now more than ever, there is a need for our world to unite\". NBC also felt its message spoke \"directly to the spirit of the Olympics and its athletes\" for its inspirational themes.[191] The song reached number one in Australia[192] and number eleven in the United States.[57] In August 2016, Perry stated that she aspired to create material \"that connects and relates and inspires\"[193] and told Ryan Seacrest that she was \"not rushing\" her fifth album, adding \"I'm just having a lot of fun, but experimenting and trying different producers, and different collaborators, and different styles\".[194] On February 10, 2017, Perry released the album's lead single \"Chained to the Rhythm\" featuring Skip Marley.[195][196] It reached number one in Hungary[197] and number four in the United States.[57] The track was also streamed over three million times on Spotify within 24 hours, breaking the music streaming service's record at the time for the highest first-day streaming for a single track by a female artist.[198] The album's second single, \"Bon App\u00e9tit\" with Migos, was released that April.[199] Its third single, \"Swish Swish\", featured Nicki Minaj and followed the next month.[200] They respectively peaked at numbers 59 and 46 in the United States,[57] and made the top 15 in Canada.[59] The album, titled Witness, was released on June 9, 2017 to mixed reviews,[201] and debuted at number one in the United States.[202] To accompany the album's release, Perry broadcast herself on YouTube for four days with a live-stream titled Katy Perry Live: Witness World Wide, concluding with a live concert on June 12.[203] The live-stream generated over 49 million views from 190 different countries.[204] She also embarked on Witness: The Tour, which began in September 2017 and ended in August 2018.[205] On June 15, 2017, Calvin Harris released a song titled \"Feels\" from his album Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1, which featured Perry, Big Sean, and Pharrell Williams.[206] The song went to reach number one in the United Kingdom.[207] Perry subsequently recorded a cover of the Dear Evan Hansen song \"Waving Through a Window\" for the deluxe edition of the cast recording, which was released on November 2, 2018.[208] The show's creators Benj Pasek and Justin Paul had requested Perry to cover the song to promote the musical's national tour and bring awareness to mental health.[209] Later that month, Perry released \"Cozy Little Christmas\".[210] She also recorded the song \"Immortal Flame\" for the game Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, and had a playable character modeled after her.[211] At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Perry performed \"Here You Come Again\", alongside Dolly Parton and Kacey Musgraves, as part of a tribute to Parton,[212] and on February 14, 2019, she released a song called \"365\", with DJ Zedd.[213] Two months later, Perry was included on a remix of Daddy Yankee's song \"Con Calma\", featuring Snow.[214] She followed this with the singles \"Never Really Over\" on May 31, \"Small Talk\" on August 9, and \"Harleys in Hawaii\" on October 16.[215][216][217] Outside of recording music, Perry appeared as herself in the film Zoolander 2, which was released in February 2016.[218][219] In February 2017, the singer launched a shoe line titled \"Katy Perry Collections\".[220] Her shoes are available on her website, Katy Perry Collections, and at retailers such as Dillard's and Walmart.[221] The following August, she hosted the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.[222] Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on ABC's revival of American Idol, which premiered in March 2018.[223][224] Perry began a relationship with Orlando Bloom in early 2016, and the couple got engaged on February 14, 2019.[225][226] In June 2019, she appeared in the music video for Taylor Swift's song \"You Need to Calm Down\".[227] In July 2019, a jury in California passed a verdict following a week-long trial that Perry's song \"Dark Horse\" had copied Flame's 2008 song \"Joyful Noise\" after he filed a copyright lawsuit alleging that it used his track's beat without permission.[228] The jury subsequently ordered her to pay him $550,000.[229] The next month, Josh Kloss, Perry's co-star in the \"Teenage Dream\" music video, accused her of sexual misconduct. In an Instagram post, Kloss alleged that, during a party at a skating rink, Perry pulled down his sweatpants and underwear, exposing his penis to her male friends. Kloss also wrote that her management prevented him from speaking about his time with the singer. Perry has not yet spoken out on his claims.[230] During the early stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as successful as Amy Grant.[231] At the age of 15, she heard Queen's \"Killer Queen,\" which inspired her to pursue a career in music.[232] She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the \"combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude\" inspired her music.[233] She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen.[182] Perry described the Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: \"Pet Sounds is one of my favorite records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds.\"[234] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as \"the only things I listened to for probably two years straight.\"[235] Perry cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a significant musical inspiration, and opted to work with Morissette's frequent collaborator Ballard as a result. Perry stated, \"Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless.\" Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.[236] Perry intends to become \"more of a Joni Mitchell\", releasing folk and acoustic music.[237] Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare. She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying \"I want to evolve like Madonna\",[238] and has credited Madonna for inspiring her to make Prism \"darker\" than her previous material.[239] Perry names Bj\u00f6rk as an influence, particularly admiring her \"willingness to always be taking chances\".[236] Other musicians who Perry has cited as influences include ABBA, the Cardigans,[240] Cyndi Lauper,[241] Ace of Base, 3OH!3,[242] CeCe Peniston, C+C Music Factory, Black Box, Crystal Waters, Mariah Carey,[237] Heart, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Imogen Heap, Rufus Wainwright,[243] Pink,[244] and Gwen Stefani.[236] \"Firework\" was inspired by a passage in the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people watch in awe.[245] Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.[246] She also credits the 1996 movie The Craft for inspiring her song \"Dark Horse\",[247] and Eckhart Tolle's book The Power of Now for influencing Prism.[139] \u2014Perry on her confidence as a songwriter[248] While Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences.[249][250] Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life.[251] The singer's fifth studio effort Witness is an electropop album that she described as a \"360-degree liberation\" record, with themes including political liberation, sexual liberation, and liberation from negativity.[252][253] Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W described the album's sexual innuendos as \"irresistible hook-laden melodies\".[30] Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.[254] Perry describes herself as a \"singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star\"[255] and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire: \"I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable.\"[14] Kristen Wiig commented that \"as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record.\"[235] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, \"being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet.\"[256] The New York Times labeled her \"the most potent pop star of the day\u00a0\u2013 her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation\".[257] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent \"clich\u00e9s\".[258] Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene,[259][260] Jessie James,[261] Kelly Clarkson,[262] Lesley Roy,[263] Britney Spears,[264] Iggy Azalea,[265] Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj.[266] Perry has a contralto vocal range.[267][268] Her singing has received both praise and criticism. Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her \"powerful voice is hard-edged\"[269] while Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals on Teenage Dream as \"processed staccato blips\".[250] Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a \"perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable\".[270] Alex Miller from NME felt that \"Perry's problem is often her voice\" on One of the Boys, stating that \"somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick\".[271] Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her \"rock chick voice\" in a review of a concert promoting Prism.[272] On social media, Perry surpassed Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter in November 2013.[273] She won the 2015 Guinness World Record for most Twitter followers,[274] and became the first person to gain 100 million followers on the site in June 2017.[275] Keith Caulfield of Billboard stated that the singer is \"the rare celebrity who seems to have enormous popularity but genuine ground-level interaction with her adoring KatyCats.\"[276] With a combined total of over 263 million followers across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, she is the fifth most followed musician across social media.[277] In June 2017, Time listed Perry among its \"25 Most Influential People on the Internet\" of the year, writing that her live-stream for Witness was \"blazing a trail\" for being \"the closest any major entertainer has come to giving fans the kind of 'real' intimacy that social media purports to provide\".[278] In 2011, Forbes ranked Perry third on their \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" list with earnings of $44 million[279] and fifth on their 2012 list with $45 million.[280] She subsequently ranked seventh on the 2013 Forbes list for \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" with $39 million earned,[281] and fifth on their 2014 list with $40 million.[282] With earnings of $135 million, Forbes also ranked Perry number one on their 2015 \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" list as well as the \"World's Highest-Paid Musicians\" and declared her the highest earning female celebrity in 2015, placing her at number 3 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list.[283] In 2016, the magazine estimated her net worth was $125 million,[284] and ranked her number six on their list of \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" with earnings of $41 million.[285] The following year, she was ranked number nine on the list with $33 million.[286] In 2018, she topped its \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" listing and ranked at number four on the \"Highest-Paid Female Celebrities\" list with earnings of $83 million.[287][288] Perry subsequently was placed at number four on the 2019 \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" listings with $57.5 million.[289] Later that year, with earnings of $530 million throughout the 2010s, the magazine also ranked her as the 9th highest earning musician of the decade.[290] Perry is considered a sex symbol; GQ labelled her a \"full-on male fantasy\",[9] while Elle described her body \"as though sketched by a teenage boy\".[21] Vice described her as a \"'serious' popstar/woman/sex symbol\".[291] She was placed at number one on the Maxim Hot 100 in 2010 as the \"most beautiful woman in the world\", with editor Joe Levy describing her as a \"triple\u00a0\u2013 no quadruple\u00a0\u2013 kind of hot\".[292] Men's Health readers voted her the \"sexiest woman of 2013\".[293] In November 2010, Perry told Harper's Bazaar that she was proud of and satisfied with her figure.[294] Perry's fashion often incorporates humor, bright colors, and food-related themes[295] such as her characteristic spinning peppermint swirl dress.[296] Vogue described her as \"never exactly one to shy away from the outrageous or the extreme in any realm\",[297] while Glamour named her the \"queen of quirk\".[298] In February 2009, Perry told Seventeen that her fashion style was \"a bit of a concoction of different things\" and stated she enjoyed humor in her clothing.[299] She has also described herself as having \"multipersonality disorder\" for fashion.[294] Perry lists Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Daphne Guinness, Natalie Portman, and the fictional character Lolita as her style icons.[30][300] Perry has supported various charitable organizations and causes during her career. She has contributed to organizations aimed at improving the lives and welfare of children in particular. In April 2013, she joined UNICEF to assist children in Madagascar with education and nutrition.[301] On December 3, 2013, she was officially named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, \"with a special focus on engaging young people in the agency's work to improve the lives of the world's most vulnerable children and adolescents.\"[302] She arranged for a portion of the money generated from tickets to her Prismatic World Tour to go to UNICEF.[303] In September 2010, she helped build and design the Boys Hope/Girls Hope foundation shelter for youth in Baltimore, Maryland along with Raven-Symon\u00e9, Shaquille O'Neal, and the cast of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.[304] She has also supported children's education and well-being. All profits from sales of the album The Gay Nineties Old Tyme Music: Daisy Bell, which includes her rendition of \"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)\", were donated to the charity Little Kids Rock, which supports musical education in underprivileged elementary schools.[172] In June 2014, she teamed up with Staples Inc. for a project entitled \"Make Roar Happen\" which donated $1 million to DonorsChoose, an organization that supports teachers and funds classroom resources in public schools.[305] In May 2016, she worked with UNICEF to improve child care quality in Vietnam, hoping to \"break the cycle of poverty and drastically improve children's health, education and well-being\".[306] The following month, UNICEF announced that Perry would receive the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award \"for her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in support of the world's most vulnerable children\" at their annual Snowflake Ball in November.[307] Perry has supported organizations aimed at aiding people suffering with diseases including cancer and HIV/AIDS. During the 2008 Warped Tour, she had a cast made of her breasts to raise money for the Keep A Breast Foundation.[308] She hosted and performed at the We Can Survive concert along with Bonnie McKee, Kacey Musgraves, Sara Bareilles, Ellie Goulding, and duo Tegan and Sara at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, on October 23, 2013. The concert's profits were donated to Young Survival Coalition, an organization aiding breast cancer in young women.[309] In June 2009, she designed an item of clothing for H&M's \"Fashion Against AIDS\" campaign, which raises money for HIV/AIDS awareness projects.[310] On February 26, 2017, she served as a co-chair alongside various celebrities such as Beyonc\u00e9, Lea Michele, Jim Carrey, Jared Leto, and Kevin Spacey for the 25th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party, a fundraiser for HIV/AIDS healthcare.[311] The proceeds from Perry's single \"Part of Me\" were donated to the charity MusiCares, which helps musicians in times of need.[312] During her California Dreams Tour, she raised over $175,000 for the Tickets-For-Charity fundraiser. The money was divided between three charities: the Children's Health Fund (CHF), Generosity Water, and The Humane Society of the United States.[313] On her 27th birthday, Perry set up a donations page for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Auckland,[314] and set up a similar page benefiting the David Lynch Foundation for her 28th birthday.[315] On March 29, 2014, she helped raise $2.4 million for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles along with other celebrities such as Ryan Seacrest, Pharrell Williams, Tim Allen, Lisa Edelstein, and Riley Keough.[316] In March 2018, Perry announced Witness: Coming Home, a benefit concert that was held in her hometown of Santa Barbara, California on May 19, 2018. The concert benefited those recovering from the aftermath of the 2017 California wildfires and 2018 Southern California mudflows.

She supported Stonewall during their \"It gets better..... today\" campaign to prevent homophobic bullying,[319] and dedicated the music video to her song \"Firework\" to the It Gets Better Project.[320] Perry told Do Something in November 2008 she was proud to be a LGBT rights activist, saying \"I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality.\" She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely between a man and a woman in California.[321] In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting \"hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [other] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future.\"[322] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth.[323] On March 18, 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for \"using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality\", with the organization further stating that \"Katy's message of inclusion and equality continues to inspire us and the world\".[324] Perry describes herself as a feminist,[325] and appeared in April 2013 in a video clip for the \"Chime For Change\" campaign that aimed to spread female empowerment.[326] She has also said that America's lack of free health care drove her \"absolutely crazy\".[327] Following the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, Perry and nearly 200 other artists and executives in music signed an open letter organized by Billboard addressed to United States Congress demanding increased gun control in the United States.[328] Through Twitter and by performing at his rallies, Perry supported President Barack Obama in his run for re-election and praised his support for same-sex marriage[329] and LGBT equality.[330] She performed at three rallies for Obama, in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Wisconsin, singing a rendition of \"Let's Stay Together\" as well as a number of her songs. During her Las Vegas performance she wore a dress made to replicate a voting ballot, with Obama's box filled in.[331] On Twitter, she encouraged her followers to vote for Obama.[332] In August 2013, Perry voiced criticism of Tony Abbott, then-leader of conservative Liberal Party of Australia and candidate for Prime Minister of Australia, due to his opposition to gay marriage and told Abbott, \"I love you as a human being but I can't give you my vote.\"; the statement came after Abbott expressed pride at learning of Perry's then-upcoming performance in Australia.[333] In April 2014, she publicly supported Marianne Williamson in her campaign for California's 33rd congressional district by attending a political press event.[334] She endorsed Kamala Harris in the United States Senate election in California, and organized a fundraiser for Harris at her home in Los Angeles in November 2016.[335] Perry also publicly endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.[336][337] She performed alongside Elton John at a fundraising concert for Clinton in New York City in March 2016.[338] Perry also spoke and performed at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Clinton.[339] Throughout her career, Perry has won five American Music Awards,[340] fourteen People's Choice Awards,[341] four Guinness World Records,[76][99][168][274] a Brit Award,[67] and a Juno Award.[91] In September 2012, Billboard dubbed her the \"Woman of the Year\".[133] From May 2010 to September 2011, the singer spent a record-breaking total of 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.[100][342] Teenage Dream became the first album by a female artist to produce five number-one Billboard Hot 100 singles, and the second album overall after Michael Jackson's Bad.[97] In the United States, she has accumulated a total of nine number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, her most recent being \"Dark Horse\",[156] and holds the record for having 18 consecutive number-one songs on the Dance Club Songs chart.[343] Billboard also named her the 15th most successful dance club artist of all time.[344] The magazine additionally ranked her 4th on its \"Greatest of All Time Pop Songs Artists\" list,[345] included Teenage Dream and Prism among its \"Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums by Women\" list,[346] and ranked \"Dark Horse\" at number 100 on its \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs\"[347] as well as one of its \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs by Women\" along with \"E.T.\", \"Firework\", and \"California Gurls\".[348] In June 2015, her music video for \"Dark Horse\" became the first video by a female artist to reach 1 billion views on Vevo.[349][350] The following month, her music video for \"Roar\" reached 1 billion views on Vevo, making her the first artist to have multiple videos with 1 billion views.[351] Perry was declared the Top Global Female Recording Artist of 2013 by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).[169] According to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the fifth top digital singles artist in the United States, with 101 million certified song units in the country including on-demand streams[352] and also has 6 million certified album units, totaling 107 million certified units in the nation.[353] She also became the first artist to have three songs receive Diamond certifications from the RIAA with \"Dark Horse\", \"Firework\", and \"Roar\".[354] All three of them and \"E.T.\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Hot n Cold\" have each sold over 5 million digital copies.[355] Throughout her career, Perry has sold more than 18 million albums and 125 million singles globally,[356] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[357] Headlining Co-headlining",

After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.\nPerry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the singles \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\". The former track also sparked controversy for its themes of lesbianism. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco, and was her first record to top the U.S. Billboard 200. It peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with the singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", while \"The One That Got Away\" reached number three on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after Michael Jackson's Bad. In 2012, Perry re-issued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the songs \"Part of Me\" and \"Wide Awake\". Her next record was Prism (2013), which became her second to top the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\". She followed this with 2017's Witness, which delved into electropop and became her third album to chart at number one in the U.S. \"Chained to the Rhythm\" was the album's most successful single, breaking Spotify's record at the time for most first-day streams for a song by a female artist.\nPerry has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011\u20132019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018.\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (n\u00e9e Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson.[1][2] Her parents are born again Christians, each having turned to religion after a \"wild youth\".[3] Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry.[4] Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry.[5] She has a younger brother named David, who is a singer,[6] and an older sister, Angela.[7] From ages 3 to 11, Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years.[2][8] Her family struggled financially,[9] sometimes using food stamps and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church.[10]\nGrowing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the word \"luck\" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\".[11] Perry primarily listened to gospel music,[12] as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends.[13] While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, \"I pray all the time\u00a0\u2013 for self-control, for humility.\"[14] Wanting to be like her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who let her take vocal lessons as Angela was at the time. She began training at age 9,[15] and was incorporated into her parents' ministry,[3] singing in church from ages 9 to 17.[16] At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday,[3][17] and publicly performed songs she wrote.[9] She tried to \"be a bit like the typical Californian girl\" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. Perry's brother David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence.[18] She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.[19]\nPerry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15,[20] during her freshman year of high school,[21] and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career.[22] She briefly had music lessons in facilities rented from the Music Academy of the West.[23] Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills.[22] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar.[12] Perry signed with Red Hill Records and recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson, which was released on March 6, 2001. She also went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour[24][25] and embarked on other performances of her own in the United States.[26] While Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics, it was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December.[27][28] Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard,[29] and moved to Los Angeles at age 17.[30] In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.[31]\nIn 2004, Perry signed to Ballard's label, Java, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. She began work on a solo record, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped.[32] Ballard then introduced Perry to Tim Devine, an A&amp;R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. Over the course of the next two years, Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut, and worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, The Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke.[33][34] In addition, after Devine suggested that songwriting team The Matrix become a \"real group\", Perry recorded with them.[35] Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as her record neared completion. After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&amp;R company called Taxi Music.[36]\nPerry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, \"Simple\", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.[37] She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song \"Old Habits Die Hard\",[38] which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie.[39] In September 2004, Blender named Perry \"The Next Big Thing\".[37] She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single \"Goodbye for Now\" and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006. That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for \"Learn to Fly\" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for \"Cupid's Chokehold\".[40]\nAfter Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke in order to add an \"undeniable smash\" to her existing material.[41][42] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to \"Ur So Gay\", a song aimed at introducing her to the music market.[43] A digital EP of the same name was also released that month.[44] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising it on the JohnJay &amp; Rich radio show in April 2008,[45] stating \"Ur So Gay\" was her \"favorite song\" at the time.[46] In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode \"Life's Too Short\"[47] and appeared as herself during a photo shoot that June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style.[48]\nPerry released her first single with Capitol, \"I Kissed a Girl\", on April 28, 2008,[49] as the lead single from One of the Boys. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it.[50] The track reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[51] \"I Kissed a Girl\" created controversy among both religious and LGBT groups. The former criticized its homosexual themes while the latter accused her of using bi-curiosity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success.[52] One of the Boys, released on June 17, 2008, garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the US Billboard 200.[53][54] The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide.[55] \"Hot n Cold\" was released the following September[56] and became the album's second successful single, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100[57] while topping charts in Germany,[58] Canada,[59] the Netherlands[60] and Austria.[61] Later singles \"Thinking of You\" and \"Waking Up in Vegas\" were released in 2009[62][63] and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.[57] The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009, as a result of her solo success.[39][64]\nAfter finishing the 2008 Warped Tour,[65] Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, where  she won the award for Best New Act.[66] At the 2009 Brit Awards, she also won the award for International Female Solo Artist.[67] Perry embarked on her first headlining world tour, the Hello Katy Tour, from January to November 2009 to support One of the Boys.[68] On August 4, 2009, she performed as opening act for one date of No Doubt's Summer Tour 2009.[69] Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009, becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies of the European awards.[70] On July 22, 2009, Perry recorded a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys as well as one new song, \"Brick by Brick\", and a cover of Fountains of Wayne's \"Hackensack\".[71] It was released on November 17, 2009.[72] Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists; she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song \"Starstrukk\" in September 2009,[73] and on a duet with Timbaland entitled \"If We Ever Meet Again\", from his album Shock Value II, in January 2010.[74][75] The Guinness World Records recognized her in its 2010 edition as the \"Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist\", for digital single sales of over two million copies.[76]\nAfter her relationship with Travis McCoy ended in December 2008,[77] Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film.[78] She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[79] The couple became engaged on December 31, 2009, while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.[80]\nAfter serving as a guest judge on American Idol,[81] Perry released \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg on May 7, 2010.[82] The song was the lead single from her third studio album, Teenage Dream, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June.[83] She also served as a guest judge on British The X Factor later that month[84] before releasing the album's second single, \"Teenage Dream\", in July.[85] \"Teenage Dream\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September.[86] Released on August 24, 2010,[87] Teenage Dream debuted at number one on the Billboard 200,[88] and received mixed reviews from music critics.[89] It has since sold 6 million copies worldwide.[90] Teenage Dream would go on to win the 2011 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[91] In October, \"Firework\" was released as the album's third single.[92] It became the album's third consecutive number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 8, 2010.[93]\n\"E.T.\" featuring Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream on February 16, 2011.[94] It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, making Teenage Dream the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the chart.[95] \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" followed as the fifth single in June,[96] and Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number-one Billboard Hot 100 songs from one album when the single topped that chart on August 17, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his album Bad.[97] For this record, she received an honorary American Music Award in November 2011[98] and a 2013 Guinness World Record.[99] On September 7, she set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100.[100] After \"The One That Got Away\" was released as the album's sixth single in October, Teenage Dream became the third album to spawn six top-five songs on the Billboard Hot 100 after Rhythm Nation 1814 by Janet Jackson and Faith by George Michael.[101][102] The song peaked at number three in the US[103] and number two in Canada.[59]\nOn January 5, 2012, Perry was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan.[104] That month, she became the first artist to have four songs sell over 5 million digital units when \"E.T.\" reached that mark along with \"Firework\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Hot N Cold\".[105] On February 13, Capitol released the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, \"Part of Me\", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart.[106] Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23.[107] \"Wide Awake\" was released on May 22 as the re-release's second single,[108] peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100[103] and number one in Canada[59] and New Zealand.[109]\nPerry embarked on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, in support of Teenage Dream[68] from February 2011 to January 2012.[110] The tour grossed $59.5 million globally[111] and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards.[112] On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John and Rihanna.[113] In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street. After her scene was uploaded to YouTube, viewers criticized Perry's exposed cleavage. Four days before the scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that the segment would not air on television, but would still be available to watch online.[114] Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.[115]\nIn December 2010, Perry played Moe Szyslak's girlfriend in the live-action segment from a Christmas episode of The Simpsons titled \"The Fight Before Christmas\".[116][117] In February 2011, she made a guest appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Oh Honey\", playing a woman known as Honey.[118] The role won her the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Guest Star in January 2012.[119] She made her film debut in the 3D family motion picture The Smurfs as Smurfette on July 29, 2011. The film was a financial success worldwide,[120] while critics gave mostly negative reviews.[121] She hosted Saturday Night Live on December 10, 2011, with Robyn as the episode's musical guest.

Both perfumes were released through Nordstrom department stores.[128][129] Electronic Arts recruited her to promote their new expansion pack for The Sims 3: Showtime,[130] before releasing a separate stuff pack featuring Perry-inspired furniture, outfits, and hairstyles, titled The Sims 3: Katy Perry's Sweet Treats, in June 2012.[131] The following month, she became the spokesperson and ambassador for Popchips and made an investment in the company.[132] Billboard dubbed her as their \"Woman of the Year\" for 2012.[133]\nShe married Russell Brand on October 23, 2010, in a traditional Hindu ceremony near the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in Rajasthan, India.[134] Brand announced on December 30, 2011, that they were divorcing after 14 months of marriage.[135] Perry later stated that conflicting career schedules and his desire to have children before she was ready led to the end of their marriage[136] and that he never spoke to her again after sending a text message that he was divorcing her,[137] while Brand asserted that he divorced her due to her commercial success and reluctance to engage in activism.[138] She was initially distraught over their divorce, and said that she contemplated suicide.[139][140] After the marriage ended in 2012,[141] Perry began a relationship with singer John Mayer that August.[142]\nIn November 2012, Perry began work on her fourth album, Prism.[143][139] She told Billboard, \"I know exactly the record I want to make next.

In an Instagram post, Kloss alleged that, during a party at a skating rink, Perry pulled down his sweatpants and underwear, exposing his penis to her male friends. Kloss also wrote that her management prevented him from speaking about his time with the singer. Perry has not yet spoken out on his claims.[230]\nDuring the early stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as successful as Amy Grant.[231] At the age of 15, she heard Queen's \"Killer Queen,\" which inspired her to pursue a career in music.[232] She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the \"combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude\" inspired her music.[233] She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen.[182] Perry described the Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: \"Pet Sounds is one of my favorite records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds.\"[234] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as \"the only things I listened to for probably two years straight.\"[235]\nPerry cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a significant musical inspiration, and opted to work with Morissette's frequent collaborator Ballard as a result. Perry stated, \"Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless.\" Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.[236] Perry intends to become \"more of a Joni Mitchell\", releasing folk and acoustic music.[237] Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare. She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying \"I want to evolve like Madonna\",[238] and has credited Madonna for inspiring her to make Prism \"darker\" than her previous material.[239]\nPerry names Bj\u00f6rk as an influence, particularly admiring her \"willingness to always be taking chances\".[236] Other musicians who Perry has cited as influences include ABBA, the Cardigans,[240] Cyndi Lauper,[241] Ace of Base, 3OH!3,[242] CeCe Peniston, C+C Music Factory, Black Box, Crystal Waters, Mariah Carey,[237] Heart, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Imogen Heap, Rufus Wainwright,[243] Pink,[244] and Gwen Stefani.[236] \"Firework\" was inspired by a passage in the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people watch in awe.[245] Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.[246] She also credits the 1996 movie The Craft for inspiring her song \"Dark Horse\",[247] and Eckhart Tolle's book The Power of Now for influencing Prism.[139]\n\u2014Perry on her confidence as a songwriter[248]\nWhile Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences.[249][250] Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life.[251] The singer's fifth studio effort Witness is an electropop album that she described as a \"360-degree liberation\" record, with themes including political liberation, sexual liberation, and liberation from negativity.[252][253] Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W described the album's sexual innuendos as \"irresistible hook-laden melodies\".[30] Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.[254]\nPerry describes herself as a \"singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star\"[255] and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire: \"I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable.\"[14] Kristen Wiig commented that \"as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record.\"[235] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, \"being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet.\"[256] The New York Times labeled her \"the most potent pop star of the day\u00a0\u2013 her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation\".[257] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent \"clich\u00e9s\".[258] Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene,[259][260] Jessie James,[261] Kelly Clarkson,[262] Lesley Roy,[263] Britney Spears,[264] Iggy Azalea,[265] Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj.[266]\nPerry has a contralto vocal range.[267][268] Her singing has received both praise and criticism. Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her \"powerful voice is hard-edged\"[269] while Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals on Teenage Dream as \"processed staccato blips\".[250] Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a \"perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable\".[270] Alex Miller from NME felt that \"Perry's problem is often her voice\" on One of the Boys, stating that \"somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick\".[271] Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her \"rock chick voice\" in a review of a concert promoting Prism.[272]\nOn social media, Perry surpassed Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter in November 2013.[273] She won the 2015 Guinness World Record for most Twitter followers,[274] and became the first person to gain 100 million followers on the site in June 2017.[275] Keith Caulfield of Billboard stated that the singer is \"the rare celebrity who seems to have enormous popularity but genuine ground-level interaction with her adoring KatyCats.\"[276] With a combined total of over 263 million followers across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, she is the fifth most followed musician across social media.[277] In June 2017, Time listed Perry among its \"25 Most Influential People on the Internet\" of the year, writing that her live-stream for Witness was \"blazing a trail\" for being \"the closest any major entertainer has come to giving fans the kind of 'real' intimacy that social media purports to provide\".[278]\nIn 2011, Forbes ranked Perry third on their \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" list with earnings of $44 million[279] and fifth on their 2012 list with $45 million.[280] She subsequently ranked seventh on the 2013 Forbes list for \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" with $39 million earned,[281] and fifth on their 2014 list with $40 million.[282] With earnings of $135 million, Forbes also ranked Perry number one on their 2015 \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" list as well as the \"World's Highest-Paid Musicians\" and declared her the highest earning female celebrity in 2015, placing her at number 3 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list.[283] In 2016, the magazine estimated her net worth was $125 million,[284] and ranked her number six on their list of \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" with earnings of $41 million.[285] The following year, she was ranked number nine on the list with $33 million.[286] In 2018, she topped its \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" listing and ranked at number four on the \"Highest-Paid Female Celebrities\" list with earnings of $83 million.[287][288] Perry subsequently was placed at number four on the 2019 \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" listings with $57.5 million.[289] Later that year, with earnings of $530 million throughout the 2010s, the magazine also ranked her as the 9th highest earning musician of the decade.[290]\nPerry is considered a sex symbol; GQ labelled her a \"full-on male fantasy\",[9] while Elle described her body \"as though sketched by a teenage boy\".[21] Vice described her as a \"'serious' popstar/woman/sex symbol\".[291] She was placed at number one on the Maxim Hot 100 in 2010 as the \"most beautiful woman in the world\", with editor Joe Levy describing her as a \"triple\u00a0\u2013 no quadruple\u00a0\u2013 kind of hot\".[292] Men's Health readers voted her the \"sexiest woman of 2013\".[293] In November 2010, Perry told Harper's Bazaar that she was proud of and satisfied with her figure.[294]\nPerry's fashion often incorporates humor, bright colors, and food-related themes[295] such as her characteristic spinning peppermint swirl dress.[296] Vogue described her as \"never exactly one to shy away from the outrageous or the extreme in any realm\",[297] while Glamour named her the \"queen of quirk\".[298] In February 2009, Perry told Seventeen that her fashion style was \"a bit of a concoction of different things\" and stated she enjoyed humor in her clothing.[299] She has also described herself as having \"multipersonality disorder\" for fashion.[294] Perry lists Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Daphne Guinness, Natalie Portman, and the fictional character Lolita as her style icons.[30][300]\nPerry has supported various charitable organizations and causes during her career. She has contributed to organizations aimed at improving the lives and welfare of children in particular. In April 2013, she joined UNICEF to assist children in Madagascar with education and nutrition.[301] On December 3, 2013, she was officially named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, \"with a special focus on engaging young people in the agency's work to improve the lives of the world's most vulnerable children and adolescents.\"[302] She arranged for a portion of the money generated from tickets to her Prismatic World Tour to go to UNICEF.[303] In September 2010, she helped build and design the Boys Hope/Girls Hope foundation shelter for youth in Baltimore, Maryland along with Raven-Symon\u00e9, Shaquille O'Neal, and the cast of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.[304]\nShe has also supported children's education and well-being. All profits from sales of the album The Gay Nineties Old Tyme Music: Daisy Bell, which includes her rendition of \"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)\", were donated to the charity Little Kids Rock, which supports musical education in underprivileged elementary schools.[172] In June 2014, she teamed up with Staples Inc. for a project entitled \"Make Roar Happen\" which donated $1 million to DonorsChoose, an organization that supports teachers and funds classroom resources in public schools.[305] In May 2016, she worked with UNICEF to improve child care quality in Vietnam, hoping to \"break the cycle of poverty and drastically improve children's health, education and well-being\".[306] The following month, UNICEF announced that Perry would receive the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award \"for her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in support of the world's most vulnerable children\" at their annual Snowflake Ball in November.[307]\nPerry has supported organizations aimed at aiding people suffering with diseases including cancer and HIV/AIDS. During the 2008 Warped Tour, she had a cast made of her breasts to raise money for the Keep A Breast Foundation.[308] She hosted and performed at the We Can Survive concert along with Bonnie McKee, Kacey Musgraves, Sara Bareilles, Ellie Goulding, and duo Tegan and Sara at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, on October 23, 2013. The concert's profits were donated to Young Survival Coalition, an organization aiding breast cancer in young women.[309] In June 2009, she designed an item of clothing for H&amp;M's \"Fashion Against AIDS\" campaign, which raises money for HIV/AIDS awareness projects.[310] On February 26, 2017, she served as a co-chair alongside various celebrities such as Beyonc\u00e9, Lea Michele, Jim Carrey, Jared Leto, and Kevin Spacey for the 25th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party, a fundraiser for HIV/AIDS healthcare.[311]\nThe proceeds from Perry's single \"Part of Me\" were donated to the charity MusiCares, which helps musicians in times of need.[312] During her California Dreams Tour, she raised over $175,000 for the Tickets-For-Charity fundraiser. The money was divided between three charities: the Children's Health Fund (CHF), Generosity Water, and The Humane Society of the United States.[313] On her 27th birthday, Perry set up a donations page for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Auckland,[314] and set up a similar page benefiting the David Lynch Foundation for her 28th birthday.[315] On March 29, 2014, she helped raise $2.4 million for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles along with other celebrities such as Ryan Seacrest, Pharrell Williams, Tim Allen, Lisa Edelstein, and Riley Keough.[316] In March 2018, Perry announced Witness: Coming Home, a benefit concert that was held in her hometown of Santa Barbara, California on May 19, 2018. The concert benefited those recovering from the aftermath of the 2017 California wildfires and 2018 Southern California mudflows. Perry partnered with the Santa Barbara Foundation, the 93108 Fund and The 805 UndocuFund, organizations which help in assisting members of the community in the Santa Barbara area through grants and various philanthropic efforts.[317]\nPerry performed at the One Love Manchester benefit concert for the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing amongst various other performers including its organizer Ariana Grande, which was broadcast live on June 4, 2017 through radio and various television stations throughout the world.[318]\nPerry has publicly advocated for LGBT rights. She supported Stonewall during their \"It gets better..... today\" campaign to prevent homophobic bullying,[319] and dedicated the music video to her song \"Firework\" to the It Gets Better Project.[320] Perry told Do Something in November 2008 she was proud to be a LGBT rights activist, saying \"I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality.\" She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely between a man and a woman in California.[321] In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting \"hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [other] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future.\"[322] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth.[323] On March 18, 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for \"using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality\", with the organization further stating that \"Katy's message of inclusion and equality continues to inspire us and the world\".[324]\nPerry describes herself as a feminist,[325] and appeared in April 2013 in a video clip for the \"Chime For Change\" campaign that aimed to spread female empowerment.[326] She has also said that America's lack of free health care drove her \"absolutely crazy\".[327] Following the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, Perry and nearly 200 other artists and executives in music signed an open letter organized by Billboard addressed to United States Congress demanding increased gun control in the United States.[328]\nThrough Twitter and by performing at his rallies, Perry supported President Barack Obama in his run for re-election and praised his support for same-sex marriage[329] and LGBT equality.[330] She performed at three rallies for Obama, in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Wisconsin, singing a rendition of \"Let's Stay Together\" as well as a number of her songs. During her Las Vegas performance she wore a dress made to replicate a voting ballot, with Obama's box filled in.[331] On Twitter, she encouraged her followers to vote for Obama.[332]\nIn August 2013, Perry voiced criticism of Tony Abbott, then-leader of conservative Liberal Party of Australia and candidate for Prime Minister of Australia, due to his opposition to gay marriage and told Abbott, \"I love you as a human being but I can't give you my vote.\"; the statement came after Abbott expressed pride at learning of Perry's then-upcoming performance in Australia.[333] In April 2014, she publicly supported Marianne Williamson in her campaign for California's 33rd congressional district by attending a political press event.[334] She endorsed Kamala Harris in the United States Senate election in California, and organized a fundraiser for Harris at her home in Los Angeles in November 2016.[335] Perry also publicly endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.[336][337] She performed alongside Elton John at a fundraising concert for Clinton in New York City in March 2016.[338] Perry also spoke and performed at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Clinton.[339]\nThroughout her career, Perry has won five American Music Awards,[340] fourteen People's Choice Awards,[341] four Guinness World Records,[76][99][168][274] a Brit Award,[67] and a Juno Award.[91] In September 2012, Billboard dubbed her the \"Woman of the Year\".[133] From May 2010 to September 2011, the singer spent a record-breaking total of 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.[100][342] Teenage Dream became the first album by a female artist to produce five number-one Billboard Hot 100 singles, and the second album overall after Michael Jackson's Bad.[97] In the United States, she has accumulated a total of nine number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, her most recent being \"Dark Horse\",[156] and holds the record for having 18 consecutive number-one songs on the Dance Club Songs chart.[343]\nBillboard also named her the 15th most successful dance club artist of all time.[344] The magazine additionally ranked her 4th on its \"Greatest of All Time Pop Songs Artists\" list,[345] included Teenage Dream and Prism among its \"Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums by Women\" list,[346] and ranked \"Dark Horse\" at number 100 on its \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs\"[347] as well as one of its \"Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs by Women\" along with \"E.T.\", \"Firework\", and \"California Gurls\".[348] In June 2015, her music video for \"Dark Horse\" became the first video by a female artist to reach 1 billion views on Vevo.[349][350] The following month, her music video for \"Roar\" reached 1 billion views on Vevo, making her the first artist to have multiple videos with 1 billion views.[351]\nPerry was declared the Top Global Female Recording Artist of 2013 by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).[169] According to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the fifth top digital singles artist in the United States, with 101 million certified song units in the country including on-demand streams[352] and also has 6 million certified album units, totaling 107 million certified units in the nation.[353] She also became the first artist to have three songs receive Diamond certifications from the RIAA with \"Dark Horse\", \"Firework\", and \"Roar\".[354] All three of them and \"E.T.\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Hot n Cold\" have each sold over 5 million digital copies.[355] Throughout her career, Perry has sold more than 18 million albums and 125 million singles globally,[356] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[357]\nHeadlining\nCo-headlining\n</body></html>"

She is known for reinventing herself throughout her career and for her versatility in numerous areas of the entertainment industry. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a music career. When Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where Akon helped her sign a joint deal with Interscope Records and his own label KonLive Distribution in 2007. She rose to prominence the following year with her debut album, the electropop record The Fame, and its chart-topping singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\". The follow-up EP The Fame Monster (2009), along with the singles \"Bad Romance\", \"Telephone\" and \"Alejandro\", were also successful. Gaga's second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with more than one million copies sold. Its title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store with over a million downloads in less than a week. Gaga experimented with EDM on her third studio album, Artpop (2013), which included the single \"Applause\". Her collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett, Cheek to Cheek (2014), and her soft rock-influenced fifth studio album, Joanne (2016), continued to top the US charts. During this period, Gaga ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015\u20132016), for which she received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and the critically acclaimed musical drama film A Star Is Born (2018). She also contributed to the latter's soundtrack, which yielded her fourth US number-one single \"Shallow\", and made her the first person to win an Academy, a Grammy, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award in one year. Having sold 27 million albums and 146 million singles as of January 2016, Gaga is one of the world's best-selling music artists and the fourth highest-earning female musician of the 2010s. Her achievements include various Guinness world records, 11 Grammy Awards and awards from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Council of Fashion Designers of America. She has been declared Billboard's Artist of the Year and Woman of the Year, and included among Forbes's power and earnings rankings. She was ranked number four on VH1's Greatest Women in Music in 2012 and second on Time's 2011 readers' poll of the most influential people of the past ten years. She is known for her philanthropy and social activism, including her work related to mental health awareness and LGBT rights. Gaga founded her nonprofit organization, the Born This Way Foundation, which focuses on empowering youth, improving mental health and preventing bullying. Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York City,[1] to a Catholic family. Both of her parents have Italian ancestry, and she also has more distant French-Canadian roots.[2] Her parents are Cynthia Louise (n\u00e9e\u00a0Bissett), a philanthropist and business executive, and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta,[3] and she has a younger sister, Natali.[4] Brought up in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga said in an interview that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything.[5][6] From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school.[7] Gaga described her high school self as \"very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined\" but also \"a bit insecure\". She considered herself a misfit and was mocked for \"being either too provocative or too eccentric\".[8] Germanotta began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become \"a cultured young woman\". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music, and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp.[9] As a teenager, she played at open mic nights.[10] Germanotta played the lead roles of Adelaide in the plays Guys and Dolls and Philia in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at Regis High School.[11] She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years.[12] Germanotta unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though she did appear in a small role as a high school student in a 2001 episode of The Sopranos titled \"The Telltale Moozadell\".[13][14] She later said of her inclination towards music: I don't know exactly where my affinity for music comes from, but it is the thing that comes easiest to me. When I was like three years old, I may have been even younger, my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young and short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano\u00a0... I was really, really good at piano, so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano, and I might not have been a natural dancer, but I am a natural musician. That is the thing that I believe I am the greatest at.[15] In 2003, at age 17, Germanotta gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21, a music school at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts, and lived in an NYU dorm. She studied music there, and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues and politics, including a thesis on pop artists Spencer Tunick and Damien Hirst.[16][17] She withdrew from school during the second semester of her sophomore year, in 2005, to focus on her music career.[18] That year she also played an unsuspecting diner customer for MTV's Boiling Points, a prank reality television show.[19] In a 2014 interview, Gaga said she had been raped at age 19, for which she later underwent mental and physical therapy.[20] She has posttraumatic stress disorder that she attributes to the incident, and says that support from doctors, family and friends has helped her.[21] In 2005, Gaga recorded two songs with hip-hop singer Melle Mel for an audio book accompanying Cricket Casey's children's novel The Portal in the Park.[22] She also formed a band called the SGBand with some friends from NYU.[11][23] They played gigs around New York and became a fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene.[11] After the 2006 Songwriters Hall of Fame New Songwriters Showcase at The Cutting Room in June, talent scout Wendy Starland recommended her to music producer Rob Fusari.[24] Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, helping to develop her songs and compose new material.[25] The producer said they began dating in May 2006, and claimed to have been the first person to call her \"Lady Gaga\", which was derived from Queen's song \"Radio Ga Ga\".[26] Their relationship lasted until January 2007.[27] Fusari and Gaga established a company called Team Lovechild, LLC to promote her career.[26] They recorded and produced electropop tracks, sending them to music industry executives. Joshua Sarubin, the head of Artists and repertoire (A&R) at Def Jam Recordings, responded positively and, after approval from Sarubin's boss Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006.[28][29] She was dropped from the label three months later[30] and returned to her family home for Christmas. She began performing at\u00a0neo-burlesque\u00a0shows, which according to her represented freedom.[31] During this time, she met performance artist Lady Starlight, who helped mold her onstage persona.[32] The pair began performing at downtown club venues like the Mercury Lounge, The Bitter End, and the Rockwood Music Hall. Their live performance art piece, known as \"Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue\" and billed as \"The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow\", was a tribute to 1970s variety acts.[33][34] They performed at the 2007 Lollapalooza music festival.[33] Having initially focused on avant-garde electronic dance music, Gaga began to incorporate pop melodies and the glam rock style of David Bowie and Queen into her songs. While Gaga and Starlight were performing, Fusari continued to develop the songs he had created with her, sending them to the producer and record executive Vincent Herbert.[35] In November 2007, Herbert signed Gaga to his label Streamline Records, an imprint of Interscope Records, established that month.[36] Gaga later credited Herbert as the man who discovered her.[37] Having served as an apprentice songwriter during an internship at Famous Music Publishing, Gaga struck a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV. As a result, she was hired to write songs for Britney Spears, New Kids on the Block, Fergie, and The Pussycat Dolls.[38] At Interscope, musician Akon was impressed with her singing abilities when she sang a reference vocal for one of his tracks in studio.[39] Akon convinced Jimmy Iovine, chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&M, to form a joint deal by having Gaga also sign with his own label KonLive, making her his \"franchise player\".[30][40] In late 2007, Gaga met with songwriter and producer RedOne.[41] She collaborated with him in the recording studio for a week on her debut album, signing with Cherrytree Records, an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter Martin Kierszenbaum; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum.[38] Despite securing a record deal, she said that some radio stations found her music too \"racy\", \"dance-oriented\", and \"underground\" for the mainstream market, to which she replied: \"My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm telling you, this is what's next.\"[7] By 2008, Gaga had relocated to Los Angeles to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, The Fame, and to set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga, modeled on Andy Warhol's Factory.[42][43] The Fame was released on August 19, 2008,[44] and reached number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, as well as the top five in Australia and the US.[45][46] Its first two singles, \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\",[47] reached number one in the United States,[48] Australia,[49] Canada[50] and the UK.[51] The latter was also the world's best-selling single of 2009, with 9.8 million copies sold that year, and spent a record 83 weeks on Billboard magazine's Digital Songs chart.[52][53] Three other singles, \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\", \"LoveGame\" and \"Paparazzi\", were released from the album;[54] the last one reached number one in Germany.[55] Remixed versions of the singles from The Fame, except \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\", were included on Hitmixes in August 2009.[56] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, The Fame and \"Poker Face\" won Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively.[57] Following her opening act on the Pussycat Dolls' 2009 Doll Domination Tour in Europe and Oceania, Gaga headlined her worldwide The Fame Ball Tour, which ran from March to September 2009.[59] While traveling the globe, she wrote eight songs for The Fame Monster, a reissue of The Fame.[60] Those new songs were also released as a standalone EP on November 18, 2009.[61] Its first single, \"Bad Romance\", was released one month earlier[62] and went number one in Canada[50] and the UK,[51] and number two in the US,[48] Australia[63] and New Zealand.[64] \"Telephone\", with Beyonc\u00e9, followed as the second single from the EP and became Gaga's fourth UK number one.[65][66] Its third single was \"Alejandro\",[67] which reached number one in Finland[68] and attracted controversy when its music video was deemed blasphemous by the Catholic League.[69] Both tracks reached the top five in the US.[48] The video for \"Bad Romance\" became the most watched on YouTube in April 2010, and that October, Gaga became the first person with more than one billion combined views.[70][71] At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, she won eight awards from 13 nominations, including Video of the Year for \"Bad Romance\".[72] She was the most nominated artist for a single year, and the first female to receive two nominations for Video of the Year at the same ceremony.[73] The Fame Monster won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and \"Bad Romance\" won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.[74] In 2009, Gaga spent a record 150 weeks on the UK Singles Chart and became the most downloaded female act in a year in the US, with 11.1 million downloads sold, earning an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.[75][76] The Fame and The Fame Monster together have since sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.[77][78] This success allowed Gaga to start her second worldwide concert tour, The Monster Ball Tour, and release The Remix, her final record with Cherrytree Records[79] and among the best-selling remix albums of all time.[80][81] The Monster Ball Tour ran from November 2009 to May 2011 and grossed $227.4 million, making it the highest-grossing concert tour for a debut headlining artist.[58][82] Concerts performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for an HBO television special, Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden.[83] Gaga also performed songs from her albums at the 2009 Royal Variety Performance, the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, and the 2010 BRIT Awards.[84] Before Michael Jackson's death, Gaga was set to take part in his canceled This Is It concert series at the O2 Arena in the UK.[85] During this era, Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with consumer electronics company Monster Cable Products to create in-ear, jewel-encrusted headphones called Heartbeats by Lady Gaga.[86] She also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as their creative director and announced a suite of photo-capture products called Grey Label.[87][88] Her collaboration with her past record producer and ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari led to a lawsuit against her production team, Mermaid Music LLC.[a] At this time, Gaga was tested borderline positive for lupus, but claimed not to be affected by the symptoms and hoped to maintain a healthy lifestyle.[91][92] In February 2011, Gaga released \"Born This Way\", the lead single from her studio album of the same name. The song sold more than one million copies within five days, earning the Guinness World Record for the fastest selling single on iTunes.[93] It debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the 1,000th number-one single in the history of the charts.[94] Its second single \"Judas\" followed two months later,[95] and \"The Edge of Glory\" served as its third single.[96] Both reached the top 10 in the US and the UK.[48][51] Her music video for \"The Edge of Glory\", unlike her previous work, portrays her dancing on a fire escape and walking on a lonely street, without intricate choreography and back-up dancers.[97] Born This Way was released on May 23, 2011,[95] and debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.1 million copies.[98] The album sold eight million copies worldwide and received three Grammy nominations, including Gaga's third consecutive nomination for Album of the Year.[99][100] Born This Way's following singles were \"You and I\" and \"Marry the Night\",[101] which reached numbers six and 29 in the US, respectively.[48] While filming the former's music video, Gaga met and started dating actor Taylor Kinney in July 2011, who played her love interest.[102][103] She also embarked on the Born This Way Ball tour in April 2012, which was scheduled to conclude the following March, but ended one month earlier when Gaga canceled the remaining dates due to a labral tear of her right hip that required surgery.[104] While refunds for the cancellations were estimated to be worth $25 million,[105] the tour grossed a total of $183.9 million globally.[106] In 2011, Gaga also worked with Tony Bennett on a jazz version of \"The Lady Is a Tramp\",[107] with Elton John on \"Hello Hello\" for the animated feature film Gnomeo & Juliet,[108] and with The Lonely Island and Justin Timberlake on \"3-Way (The Golden Rule)\".[109] She also performed a concert at the Sydney Town Hall in Australia that year to promote Born This Way and to celebrate former US President Bill Clinton's 65th birthday.[110] In November, she was featured in a Thanksgiving television special titled A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, which attracted 5.7 million American viewers and spawned the release of her fourth EP, A Very Gaga Holiday.[111] In 2012, Gaga guest-starred as an animated version of herself in an episode of The Simpsons called \"Lisa Goes Gaga\",[112] appeared in the documentary films The Zen of Bennett and Katy Perry: Part of Me,[113][114] and released her first fragrance, Lady Gaga Fame, followed by a second one, Eau de Gaga, in 2014.[b] Gaga began work on her third studio album, Artpop, in early 2012, during the Born This Way Ball tour; she crafted the album to mirror \"a night at the club\".[117][118][119] In August 2013, Gaga released the album's lead single \"Applause\",[120] which reached number one in Hungary, number four in the US, and number five in the UK.[51][48][121] A lyric video for Artpop track \"Aura\" followed in October to accompany Robert Rodriguez's Machete Kills, where she plays an assassin named La Chameleon.[122] The film received generally negative reviews and earned less than half of its $33 million budget.[123][124] The second Artpop single, \"Do What U Want\", featured singer R. Kelly and was released later that month,[125] topping the charts in Hungary and reaching number 13 in the US.[48][126] Gaga removed the song from all streaming platforms in 2019 in the light of allegations made against Kelly sexually abusing several women; Gaga apologized for ever collaborating with him.[127] Artpop was released on November 6, 2013 to mixed reviews.[128] Helen Brown in The Daily Telegraph criticized Gaga for making another album about her fame and doubted the record's originality, but found it \"great for dancing\".[129] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, and sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide as of July 2014.[130][131] \"G.U.Y.\" was released as the third single in March 2014 and peaked at number 76 in the US.[48][132] Gaga hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in November 2013, performing \"Do What U Want\" (with Kelly) and an album cut, \"Gypsy\".[134] After holding her second Thanksgiving Day television special on ABC, Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular, she performed a special rendition of \"Do What U Want\" with Christina Aguilera on the fifth season of the American reality talent show The Voice.[135][136] In March 2014, Gaga had a seven-day concert residency commemorating the last performance at New York's Roseland Ballroom before its closure.[137] Two months later, she embarked on the ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour, building on concepts from her ArtRave promotional event. Earning $83 million, the tour included cities canceled from the Born This Way Ball tour itinerary.[138] In the meantime, Gaga split from longtime manager Troy Carter over \"creative differences\",[139] and by June 2014, she and new manager Bobby Campbell joined Artist Nation, the artist management division of Live Nation Entertainment.[140] She briefly appeared in Rodriguez's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and was confirmed as Versace's spring-summer 2014 face with a campaign called \"Lady Gaga For Versace\".[141][142] In September 2014, Gaga released a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett titled Cheek to Cheek. The inspiration behind the album came from her friendship with Bennett, and fascination with jazz music since her childhood.[143] Before the album was released, it produced the singles \"Anything Goes\" and \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\".[144] Cheek to Cheek received generally favorable reviews;[145] The Guardian's Caroline Sullivan praised Gaga's vocals and Howard Reich of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \"Cheek to Cheek serves up the real thing, start to finish\".[146][147] The record was Gaga's third consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200,[148] and won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.[149] The duo recorded the concert special Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live!,[150] and embarked on the Cheek to Cheek Tour from December 2014 to August 2015.[151] In February 2015, Gaga became engaged to Taylor Kinney.[152] After Artpop's lukewarm response, Gaga began to redo her image and style. According to Billboard, this shift started with the release of Cheek to Cheek and the attention she received for her performance at the 87th Academy Awards, where she sang a medley of songs from The Sound of Music in a tribute to Julie Andrews.[133] Considered one of her best performances by Billboard, it triggered more than 214,000 interactions per minute globally on Facebook.[153][154] She and Diane Warren co-wrote the song \"Til It Happens to You\" for the documentary The Hunting Ground, which earned them the Satellite Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award nomination in the same category.[155] Gaga won Billboard Woman of the Year and Contemporary Icon Award at the 2015 Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards.[156][157] Gaga had spent much of her early life wanting to be an actress, and achieved her goal when she starred in American Horror Story: Hotel.[158] Running from October 2015 to January 2016, Hotel is the fifth season of the television anthology horror series, American Horror Story, in which Gaga played a hotel owner named Elizabeth.[159][160] At the 73rd Golden Globe Awards, Gaga received the Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film award for her work on the season.[158] She appeared in Nick Knight's 2015 fashion film for Tom Ford's 2016 spring campaign[161] and was guest editor for V fashion magazine's 99th issue in January 2016, which featured 16 different covers.[162] She received Editor of the Year award at the Fashion Los Angeles Awards.[163] In 2016, Gaga sang the US national anthem in February at Super Bowl 50,[164] partnered with Intel and Nile Rodgers for a tribute performance to the late David Bowie at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards,[165] and sang \"Til It Happens to You\" at the 88th Academy Awards, where she was introduced by Joe Biden and was accompanied on-stage by 50 people who had suffered from sexual assault.[166] She was honored that April with the Artist Award at the Jane Ortner Education Awards by The Grammy Museum, which recognizes artists who have demonstrated passion and dedication to education through the arts.[167] Her engagement to Taylor Kinney ended in July; she later said her career had interfered with their relationship.[168] Gaga played a witch named Scathach in American Horror Story: Roanoke, the series' sixth season,[169] which ran from September to November 2016.[170][171] Her role in the fifth season of the show ultimately influenced her future music, prompting her to feature \"the art of darkness\".[172] In September 2016, she released her fifth album's lead single, \"Perfect Illusion\", which topped the charts in France and reached number 15 in the US.[173][174][175] The album, titled Joanne, was named after Gaga's late aunt, who was an inspiration for the music.[176] It was released on October 21, 2016, and became Gaga's fourth number one album on the Billboard 200, making her the first woman to reach the US chart's summit four times in the 2010s.[177] The album's second single, \"Million Reasons\", followed the next month and reached number four in the US.[175][178] She later released a piano version of the album's title track in 2018,[179] which won a Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance.[180] To promote the album, Gaga embarked on the three-date Dive Bar Tour.[181] Gaga performed as the headlining act during the Super Bowl LI halftime show on February 5, 2017. Her performance featured a group of hundreds of lighted drones forming various shapes in the sky above Houston's NRG Stadium\u2014the first time robotic aircraft appeared in a Super Bowl program.[182] It attracted 117.5 million viewers in the United States, exceeding the game's total of 113.3 million viewers.[183] The performance led to a surge of 410,000 song downloads in the United States for Gaga and earned her an Emmy nomination in the Outstanding Special Class Program category.[184][185] CBS Sports included her performance as the second best in the history of Super Bowl halftime shows.[186] In April, Gaga headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[187] She also released a standalone-single, \"The Cure\", which reached the top 10 in Australia.[188][189] In August, Gaga began the Joanne World Tour, which she announced after the Super Bowl LI halftime show.[190] Gaga's creation of Joanne and preparation for her halftime show performance were featured in the documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two, which premiered on Netflix in September.[191] Throughout the film, she was seen suffering from chronic pain, which was later revealed to be the effect of a long-term condition called fibromyalgia.[192] It resulted in Gaga canceling the last ten shows of the Joanne World Tour, which ultimately grossed $95\u00a0million from 842,000 tickets sold.[193][194] In March 2018, Gaga supported the March for Our Lives gun-control rally in Washington, D.C.,[195] and released a cover of Elton John's \"Your Song\" for his tribute album Revamp.[196] Later that year, she starred as a struggling singer named Ally in Bradley Cooper's critically acclaimed musical romantic drama A Star Is Born, a remake of the 1937 film of the same name. The film follows Ally's relationship with singer Jackson Maine (played by Cooper), which becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his.[197] Cooper approached Gaga after seeing her perform at a cancer research fundraiser; a fan of Cooper's work, Gaga agreed to the project due to its portrayal of addiction and depression.[198][199] A Star Is Born premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival in August 2018, and was released worldwide in October.[200] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described it as \"outrageously watchable\" and wrote that \"Gaga's ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level\".[201] Time's Stephanie Zacharek similarly highlighted her \"knockout performance\" and found her \"charismatic\" without her usual makeup, wigs and costumes.[202] Alongside her nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress, Gaga received the Critics' Choice and National Board of Review awards for the role.[203] Gaga and Cooper co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the soundtrack for A Star Is Born, which she insisted they perform live in the film.[204] Its lead single, \"Shallow\", performed by the two, was released on September 27, 2018[205] and has reached number one in various nations including Australia, the UK and the US.[206] The soundtrack contains 34 tracks, including 19 original songs, and received generally positive reviews;[207] Mark Kennedy of The Washington Post called it a \"five-star marvel\" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian termed it an \"instant classics full of Gaga's emotional might\".[208][209] Commercially, the soundtrack debuted at number one in the US, making Gaga the first woman with five US number one albums in the 2010s, and breaking her tie with Taylor Swift as the most for any female artist this decade;[210] Swift tied with her again in 2019.[211] It additionally topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK.[212] As of June 2019, the soundtrack had sold over six million copies worldwide.[213] The album won Gaga four Grammy Awards\u2014Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media for \"Shallow\", as well as the latter category for \"I'll Never Love Again\"\u2014and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.[180][214][215] \"Shallow\" also earned her an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Original Song.[203] In October, Gaga announced her engagement to talent agent Christian Carino whom she had met in early 2017.[216] They ended the engagement in February 2019.[217] Gaga signed a two-year residency, named Lady Gaga Enigma, to perform at the MGM Park Theater in Las Vegas.[218] The residency consists of two types of shows: Enigma, which focuses on theatricality and includes the singer's biggest hits,[219] and Jazz and Piano, which involves tracks from the Great American Songbook and stripped-down versions of Gaga's songs. The Enigma residency show opened in December 2018 and the Jazz and Piano in January 2019, with the residency due to last until May 2020.[220][221] Gaga launched her first, vegan makeup line, Haus Laboratories, in September 2019 exclusively on Amazon. Consisting of 40 products, including liquid eyeliners, lip glosses and face mask sticker, it reached number-one on Amazon's list of best-selling lipsticks.[222] She has also started working on her sixth studio album,[223] and was seen in recording studios with producers like Boys Noize, DJ White Shadow, BloodPop, and Sophie.[224] In October, she announced that the album would be titled Adele,[225] with several news outlets taking the announcement as a joke.[226][227] Gaga is next committed to portray Patrizia Reggiani, who was convicted of hiring a hitman to murder her ex-husband and former head of the Gucci fashion house Maurizio Gucci, in an upcoming film directed by Ridley Scott.[228] Gaga grew up listening to artists such as Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, the Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie and Garbage,[229][230] who have all influenced her music.[231][232] Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater.[30][233] She has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga.[234] Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music as Madonna has.[235] Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, specifically Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Marilyn Manson.[236][237][238][239] She credits Beyonc\u00e9 as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.[240] Gaga was inspired by her mother to be interested in fashion, which she now says is a major influence and integrated with her music.[18][241] Stylistically, Gaga has been compared to Leigh Bowery, Isabella Blow, and Cher;[242][243] she once commented that as a child, she absorbed Cher's fashion sense and made it her own.[243] She considers Donatella Versace her muse and the British fashion designer Alexander McQueen as an inspiration.[91][244] In turn, Versace calls Lady Gaga \"the fresh Donatella\".[245] Gaga has also been influenced by Princess Diana, whom she has admired since her childhood.[246] Gaga has called the Indian alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra a \"true inspiration\",[247] and has also quoted Indian leader Osho's book Creativity on Twitter. Gaga says she was influenced by Osho's work in valuing rebellion through creativity and equality.[248] Critics have analyzed and scrutinized Gaga's musical and performance style, as she has experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career. She says the continual reinvention is \"liberating\" herself, which she has been drawn to since childhood.[249] Gaga is a contralto with a range spanning from B\u266d2 to B5.[250][251][252] She has changed her vocal style regularly, and considers Born This Way \"much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of\".[253][254] In summing up her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power.\"[255] Gaga's songs have been called \"depthless\" by writer Camille Paglia in The Sunday Times,[256] but according to Evan Sawdey of PopMatters, she \"does manage to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace\".[257] Gaga believes that \"all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit\".[258] Simon Reynolds wrote in 2010, \"Everything about Gaga came from electroclash, except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy naughties pop glazed with Auto-Tune and undergirded with R&B-ish beats.\"[259] Gaga's songs have covered a wide variety of concepts; The Fame discusses the lust for stardom, while the follow-up The Fame Monster expresses fame's dark side through monster metaphors. The Fame is an electropop and dance-pop album that has influences of 1980s pop and 1990s Europop,[260] whereas The Fame Monster displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on \"Seventies arena glam, perky ABBA disco, and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q\".[261] Born This Way has lyrics in English, French, German, and Spanish and features themes common to Gaga's controversial songwriting such as sex, love, religion, money, drugs, identity, liberation, sexuality, freedom, and individualism.[262] The album explores new genres, such as electronic rock and techno.[263] The themes in Artpop revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, love, sex, feminism, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny.[264] Billboard describes Artpop as \"coherently channeling R&B, techno, disco and rock music\".[265] With Cheek to Cheek, Gaga dabbled in the jazz genre.[266] Joanne, exploring the genres of country, funk, pop, dance, rock, electronic music and folk, was influenced by her personal life.[267] A Star Is Born contains elements of blues rock, country and bubblegum pop.[208] Billboard says its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as \"timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener.\"[268] Featuring constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films.[269] The video for \"Telephone\" earned Gaga the Guinness World Record for Most Product Placement in a Video.[270] According to author Curtis Fogel, she explores bondage and sadomasochism and highlights prevalent feminist themes. The main themes of her music videos are sex, violence, and power. She calls herself \"a little bit of a feminist\" and asserts that she is \"sexually empowering women\".[271] Gaga has called herself a perfectionist when it comes to her elaborate shows.[272] Her performances have been described as \"highly entertaining and innovative\";[273] the blood-spurting performance of \"Paparazzi\" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was described as \"eye-popping\" by MTV News.[274] She continued the blood-soaked theme during The Monster Ball Tour, causing protests in England from family groups and fans in the aftermath of the Cumbria shootings, in which a taxi driver had killed 12 people, then himself.[275] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Gaga appeared in drag as her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, and delivered a lovesick monologue before a performance of her song \"You and I\".[276] As Gaga's choreographer and creative director, Laurieann Gibson provided material for her shows and videos for four years before she was replaced by her assistant Richard Jackson in 2014.[277] In an article for Billboard by Rebecca Schiller in October 2018, the author traced back Gaga's videography from \"Just Dance\" till the release of A Star Is Born. Schiller noted how, following the Artpop era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from Joanne, taking the example of the music video of lead single \"Perfect Illusion\" where the singer \"[ditched] the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party\". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona.[278] Public reception of Gaga's music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina has offered a course titled \"Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame\" since early 2011 with the objective of unraveling \"some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga\".[280] When Gaga met briefly with then-president Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction \"intimidating\" as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman in the room.[281] When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for androgyny.[282] In a 2010 Sunday Times article, Camille Paglia called Gaga \"more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those\".[283] Gaga's outlandish fashion sense has also served as an important aspect of her character.[242][244] During her early career, members of the media compared her fashion choices to those of Christina Aguilera.[244] In 2011, 121 women gathered at the Grammy Awards dressed in costumes similar to those worn by Gaga, earning the 2011 Guinness World Record for Largest Gathering of Lady Gaga Impersonators.[93] The Global Language Monitor named \"Lady Gaga\" as the Top Fashion Buzzword with her trademark \"no pants\" a close third.[284] Entertainment Weekly put her outfits on its end of the decade \"best-of\" list, saying that she \"brought performance art into the mainstream\".[285] Time placed Gaga on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons List, stating: \"Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits\u00a0... [Gaga] has sported outfits made from plastic bubbles, Kermit the Frog dolls, and raw meat.\"[286] Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, which was supplemented by boots, a purse, and a hat also made out of raw beef.[287] Partly awarded in recognition of the dress, Vogue named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 and Time named the dress the Fashion Statement of the year.[288][289] It attracted the attention of worldwide media; the animal rights organization PETA found it offensive.[290] The meat dress was displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in 2012,[291] and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 2015.[292] Gaga's fans call her \"Mother Monster\", and she often refers to them as \"Little Monsters\", a phrase which she had tattooed on herself in dedication.[293] In his article \"Lady Gaga Pioneered Online Fandom Culture As We Know It\" for Vice, Jake Hall wrote that Gaga inspired several subsequent fan-brandings, such as those of Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Justin Bieber.[294] In July 2012, Gaga also co-founded the social networking service LittleMonsters.com, devoted to her fans.[295] According to Guinness World Records, Gaga was the most followed person on Twitter in 2011, as well as the most followed female pop singer and the most powerful popstar in 2014.[93][296] Forbes included Gaga on its Celebrity 100 from 2010 to 2015 and then from 2018 to 2019 and its list of the World's Most Powerful Women from 2010 to 2014.[297][298] She earned $62 million, $90 million, $52 million, $80 million, $33 million, and $59 million from 2010 through 2015, and $50 million and $39 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively.[299][300] She was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2010[301] and 2019,[302] and ranked second in most influential people of the past ten years in a Time magazine readers' poll in 2013.[303] In March 2012, Gaga was ranked fourth on Billboard's list of top moneymakers of 2011 with earnings of $25 million, which included sales from Born This Way and her Monster Ball Tour.[304] The following year, she topped Forbes' List of Top-Earning Celebs Under 30,[300] and in February 2016, the magazine estimated Gaga's net worth to be $275 million.[305] In December 2019, Gaga placed 10th on Forbes' list of Top-Earning Musicians Of The Decade with earnings of $500 million in the 2010s; she was the fourth highest-earning female musician on the list.[306] After declining an invitation to appear on the single \"We Are the World 25\" (because of rehearsals for her tour) to benefit victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Gaga donated the proceeds of her January 2010 Radio City Music Hall concert to the country's reconstruction relief fund.[307] All profits from her online store that day were also donated, and Gaga announced that $500,000 was collected for the fund.[308] Hours after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, Gaga tweeted a link to Japan Prayer Bracelets. All revenue from a bracelet she designed in conjunction with the company was donated to relief efforts;[309] these raised $1.5\u00a0million.[310] In June 2011, Gaga performed at MTV Japan's charity show in Makuhari Messe, which benefited the Japanese Red Cross.[311] In 2012, Gaga joined the campaign group Artists Against Fracking.[312] That October, Yoko Ono gave Gaga and four other activists the LennonOno Grant for Peace in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland.[313] The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Gaga also contributes in the fight against HIV and AIDS, focusing on educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with Cyndi Lauper, Gaga joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam.[314] Sales have raised more than $202 million to fight HIV and AIDS.[315] In April 2016, Gaga joined Vice President Joe Biden at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to support Biden's It's On Us campaign as he traveled to colleges on behalf of the organization, which has seen 250,000 students from more than 530 colleges sign a pledge of solidarity and activism.[316] Two months later, Gaga attended the 84th Annual US Conference of Mayors in Indianapolis where she joined with the Dalai Lama to talk about the power of kindness and how to make the world a more compassionate place.[317] Due to her meeting with Dalai Lama, the Chinese government added Gaga to a list of hostile foreign forces, and Chinese websites and media organizations were ordered to stop uploading or distributing her songs. The Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CCPPD) also issued an order for state-controlled media to condemn this meeting.[318] In 2012, Gaga launched the Born This Way Foundation (BTWF), a non-profit organization that focuses on youth empowerment. It takes its name from her 2011 single and album. Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and US Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the foundation's inauguration at Harvard University.[319] The foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from Barneys New York.[320] In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with Office Depot, which donated 25% of the sales, a minimum of $1 million of a series of limited edition back-to-school products.[321] The foundation's initiatives have included the \"Born Brave Bus\" that followed her on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying.[322][323] In October 2015, at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Gaga joined 200 high school students, policy makers, and academic officials, including Peter Salovey, to discuss ways to recognize and channel emotions for positive outcomes.[324] In 2016, the foundation partnered with Intel, Vox Media, and Re/code to fight online harassment.[325] The sales revenue of the 99th issue of the V magazine, which featured Gaga and Kinney, was donated to the foundation.[162] Gaga and Elton John released the clothing and accessories line Love Bravery at Macy's in May. 25% of each purchase support Gaga's foundation and the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[326] Gaga partnered with Starbucks for a week in June 2017 with the \"Cups of Kindness\" campaign, where the company donated 25 cents from some of the beverages sold to the foundation.[327] She also appeared in a video by Staples Inc. to raise funds for the foundation and DonorsChoose.org.[328] On the 2018 World Kindness Day, Gaga partnered with the foundation to bring food and relief to a Red Cross shelter for people who have been forced to evacuate homes due to the California wildfires. The foundation also partnered with Starbucks and SoulCycle to thank California firefighters for their relief work during the crisis.

She is known for reinventing herself throughout her career and for her versatility in numerous areas of the entertainment industry. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a music career. When Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where Akon helped her sign a joint deal with Interscope Records and his own label KonLive Distribution in 2007. She rose to prominence the following year with her debut album, the electropop record The Fame, and its chart-topping singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\". The follow-up EP The Fame Monster (2009), along with the singles \"Bad Romance\", \"Telephone\" and \"Alejandro\", were also successful.\nGaga's second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with more than one million copies sold. Its title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store with over a million downloads in less than a week. Gaga experimented with EDM on her third studio album, Artpop (2013), which included the single \"Applause\". Her collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett, Cheek to Cheek (2014), and her soft rock-influenced fifth studio album, Joanne (2016), continued to top the US charts. During this period, Gaga ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015\u20132016), for which she received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and the critically acclaimed musical drama film A Star Is Born (2018). She also contributed to the latter's soundtrack, which yielded her fourth US number-one single \"Shallow\", and made her the first person to win an Academy, a Grammy, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award in one year.\nHaving sold 27 million albums and 146 million singles as of January 2016, Gaga is one of the world's best-selling music artists and the fourth highest-earning female musician of the 2010s. Her achievements include various Guinness world records, 11 Grammy Awards and awards from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Council of Fashion Designers of America. She has been declared Billboard's Artist of the Year and Woman of the Year, and included among Forbes's power and earnings rankings. She was ranked number four on VH1's Greatest Women in Music in 2012 and second on Time's 2011 readers' poll of the most influential people of the past ten years. She is known for her philanthropy and social activism, including her work related to mental health awareness and LGBT rights. Gaga founded her nonprofit organization, the Born This Way Foundation, which focuses on empowering youth, improving mental health and preventing bullying.\nStefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York City,[1] to a Catholic family. Both of her parents have Italian ancestry, and she also has more distant French-Canadian roots.[2] Her parents are Cynthia Louise (n\u00e9e\u00a0Bissett), a philanthropist and business executive, and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta,[3] and she has a younger sister, Natali.[4] Brought up in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga said in an interview that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything.[5][6] From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school.[7] Gaga described her high school self as \"very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined\" but also \"a bit insecure\". She considered herself a misfit and was mocked for \"being either too provocative or too eccentric\".[8]\nGermanotta began playing the piano at age four when her mother insisted she become \"a cultured young woman\". She took piano lessons and practiced through her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music, and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp.[9] As a teenager, she played at open mic nights.[10] Germanotta played the lead roles of Adelaide in the plays Guys and Dolls and Philia in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at Regis High School.[11] She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years.[12] Germanotta unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though she did appear in a small role as a high school student in a 2001 episode of The Sopranos titled \"The Telltale Moozadell\".[13][14] She later said of her inclination towards music:\nI don't know exactly where my affinity for music comes from, but it is the thing that comes easiest to me. When I was like three years old, I may have been even younger, my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young and short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano\u00a0... I was really, really good at piano, so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano, and I might not have been a natural dancer, but I am a natural musician. That is the thing that I believe I am the greatest at.[15]\nIn 2003, at age 17, Germanotta gained early admission to Collaborative Arts Project 21, a music school at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts, and lived in an NYU dorm. She studied music there, and improved her songwriting skills by writing essays on art, religion, social issues and politics, including a thesis on pop artists Spencer Tunick and Damien Hirst.[16][17] She withdrew from school during the second semester of her sophomore year, in 2005, to focus on her music career.[18] That year she also played an unsuspecting diner customer for MTV's Boiling Points, a prank reality television show.[19]\nIn a 2014 interview, Gaga said she had been raped at age 19, for which she later underwent mental and physical therapy.[20] She has posttraumatic stress disorder that she attributes to the incident, and says that support from doctors, family and friends has helped her.[21]\nIn 2005, Gaga recorded two songs with hip-hop singer Melle Mel for an audio book accompanying Cricket Casey's children's novel The Portal in the Park.[22] She also formed a band called the SGBand with some friends from NYU.[11][23] They played gigs around New York and became a fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene.[11] After the 2006 Songwriters Hall of Fame New Songwriters Showcase at The Cutting Room in June, talent scout Wendy Starland recommended her to music producer Rob Fusari.[24] Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, helping to develop her songs and compose new material.[25] The producer said they began dating in May 2006, and claimed to have been the first person to call her \"Lady Gaga\", which was derived from Queen's song \"Radio Ga Ga\".[26] Their relationship lasted until January 2007.[27]\nFusari and Gaga established a company called Team Lovechild, LLC to promote her career.[26] They recorded and produced electropop tracks, sending them to music industry executives. Joshua Sarubin, the head of Artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) at Def Jam Recordings, responded positively and, after approval from Sarubin's boss Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006.[28][29] She was dropped from the label three months later[30] and returned to her family home for Christmas. She began performing at\u00a0neo-burlesque\u00a0shows, which according to her represented freedom.[31] During this time, she met performance artist Lady Starlight, who helped mold her onstage persona.[32] The pair began performing at downtown club venues like the Mercury Lounge, The Bitter End, and the Rockwood Music Hall. Their live performance art piece, known as \"Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue\" and billed as \"The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow\", was a tribute to 1970s variety acts.[33][34] They performed at the 2007 Lollapalooza music festival.[33]\nHaving initially focused on avant-garde electronic dance music, Gaga began to incorporate pop melodies and the glam rock style of David Bowie and Queen into her songs. While Gaga and Starlight were performing, Fusari continued to develop the songs he had created with her, sending them to the producer and record executive Vincent Herbert.[35] In November 2007, Herbert signed Gaga to his label Streamline Records, an imprint of Interscope Records, established that month.[36] Gaga later credited Herbert as the man who discovered her.[37] Having served as an apprentice songwriter during an internship at Famous Music Publishing, Gaga struck a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV. As a result, she was hired to write songs for Britney Spears, New Kids on the Block, Fergie, and The Pussycat Dolls.[38] At Interscope, musician Akon was impressed with her singing abilities when she sang a reference vocal for one of his tracks in studio.[39] Akon convinced Jimmy Iovine, chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M, to form a joint deal by having Gaga also sign with his own label KonLive, making her his \"franchise player\".[30][40]\nIn late 2007, Gaga met with songwriter and producer RedOne.[41] She collaborated with him in the recording studio for a week on her debut album, signing with Cherrytree Records, an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter Martin Kierszenbaum; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum.[38] Despite securing a record deal, she said that some radio stations found her music too \"racy\", \"dance-oriented\", and \"underground\" for the mainstream market, to which she replied: \"My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm telling you, this is what's next.\"[7]\nBy 2008, Gaga had relocated to Los Angeles to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, The Fame, and to set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga, modeled on Andy Warhol's Factory.[42][43] The Fame was released on August 19, 2008,[44] and reached number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK, as well as the top five in Australia and the US.[45][46] Its first two singles, \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\",[47] reached number one in the United States,[48] Australia,[49] Canada[50] and the UK.[51] The latter was also the world's best-selling single of 2009, with 9.8 million copies sold that year, and spent a record 83 weeks on Billboard magazine's Digital Songs chart.[52][53] Three other singles, \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\", \"LoveGame\" and \"Paparazzi\", were released from the album;[54] the last one reached number one in Germany.[55] Remixed versions of the singles from The Fame, except \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\", were included on Hitmixes in August 2009.[56] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, The Fame and \"Poker Face\" won Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively.[57]\nFollowing her opening act on the Pussycat Dolls' 2009 Doll Domination Tour in Europe and Oceania, Gaga headlined her worldwide The Fame Ball Tour, which ran from March to September 2009.[59] While traveling the globe, she wrote eight songs for The Fame Monster, a reissue of The Fame.[60] Those new songs were also released as a standalone EP on November 18, 2009.[61] Its first single, \"Bad Romance\", was released one month earlier[62] and went number one in Canada[50] and the UK,[51] and number two in the US,[48] Australia[63] and New Zealand.[64] \"Telephone\", with Beyonc\u00e9, followed as the second single from the EP and became Gaga's fourth UK number one.[65][66] Its third single was \"Alejandro\",[67] which reached number one in Finland[68] and attracted controversy when its music video was deemed blasphemous by the Catholic League.[69] Both tracks reached the top five in the US.[48] The video for \"Bad Romance\" became the most watched on YouTube in April 2010, and that October, Gaga became the first person with more than one billion combined views.[70][71] At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, she won eight awards from 13 nominations, including Video of the Year for \"Bad Romance\".[72] She was the most nominated artist for a single year, and the first female to receive two nominations for Video of the Year at the same ceremony.[73] The Fame Monster won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and \"Bad Romance\" won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.[74]\nIn 2009, Gaga spent a record 150 weeks on the UK Singles Chart and became the most downloaded female act in a year in the US, with 11.1 million downloads sold, earning an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records.[75][76] The Fame and The Fame Monster together have since sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.[77][78] This success allowed Gaga to start her second worldwide concert tour, The Monster Ball Tour, and release The Remix, her final record with Cherrytree Records[79] and among the best-selling remix albums of all time.[80][81] The Monster Ball Tour ran from November 2009 to May 2011 and grossed $227.4 million, making it the highest-grossing concert tour for a debut headlining artist.[58][82] Concerts performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for an HBO television special, Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden.[83] Gaga also performed songs from her albums at the 2009 Royal Variety Performance, the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, and the 2010 BRIT Awards.[84] Before Michael Jackson's death, Gaga was set to take part in his canceled This Is It concert series at the O2 Arena in the UK.[85]\nDuring this era, Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with consumer electronics company Monster Cable Products to create in-ear, jewel-encrusted headphones called Heartbeats by Lady Gaga.[86] She also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as their creative director and announced a suite of photo-capture products called Grey Label.[87][88] Her collaboration with her past record producer and ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari led to a lawsuit against her production team, Mermaid Music LLC.[a] At this time, Gaga was tested borderline positive for lupus, but claimed not to be affected by the symptoms and hoped to maintain a healthy lifestyle.[91][92]\nIn February 2011, Gaga released \"Born This Way\", the lead single from her studio album of the same name. The song sold more than one million copies within five days, earning the Guinness World Record for the fastest selling single on iTunes.[93] It debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the 1,000th number-one single in the history of the charts.[94] Its second single \"Judas\" followed two months later,[95] and \"The Edge of Glory\" served as its third single.[96] Both reached the top 10 in the US and the UK.[48][51] Her music video for \"The Edge of Glory\", unlike her previous work, portrays her dancing on a fire escape and walking on a lonely street, without intricate choreography and back-up dancers.[97]\nBorn This Way was released on May 23, 2011,[95] and debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.1 million copies.[98] The album sold eight million copies worldwide and received three Grammy nominations, including Gaga's third consecutive nomination for Album of the Year.[99][100] Born This Way's following singles were \"You and I\" and \"Marry the Night\",[101] which reached numbers six and 29 in the US, respectively.[48] While filming the former's music video, Gaga met and started dating actor Taylor Kinney in July 2011, who played her love interest.[102][103] She also embarked on the Born This Way Ball tour in April 2012, which was scheduled to conclude the following March, but ended one month earlier when Gaga canceled the remaining dates due to a labral tear of her right hip that required surgery.[104] While refunds for the cancellations were estimated to be worth $25 million,[105] the tour grossed a total of $183.9 million globally.[106]\nIn 2011, Gaga also worked with Tony Bennett on a jazz version of \"The Lady Is a Tramp\",[107] with Elton John on \"Hello Hello\" for the animated feature film Gnomeo &amp; Juliet,[108] and with The Lonely Island and Justin Timberlake on \"3-Way (The Golden Rule)\".[109] She also performed a concert at the Sydney Town Hall in Australia that year to promote Born This Way and to celebrate former US President Bill Clinton's 65th birthday.[110] In November, she was featured in a Thanksgiving television special titled A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, which attracted 5.7 million American viewers and spawned the release of her fourth EP, A Very Gaga Holiday.[111] In 2012, Gaga guest-starred as an animated version of herself in an episode of The Simpsons called \"Lisa Goes Gaga\",[112] appeared in the documentary films The Zen of Bennett and Katy Perry: Part of Me,[113][114] and released her first fragrance, Lady Gaga Fame, followed by a second one, Eau de Gaga, in 2014.[b]\nGaga began work on her third studio album, Artpop, in early 2012, during the Born This Way Ball tour; she crafted the album to mirror \"a night at the club\".[117][118][119] In August 2013, Gaga released the album's lead single \"Applause\",[120] which reached number one in Hungary, number four in the US, and number five in the UK.[51][48][121] A lyric video for Artpop track \"Aura\" followed in October to accompany Robert Rodriguez's Machete Kills, where she plays an assassin named La Chameleon.[122] The film received generally negative reviews and earned less than half of its $33 million budget.[123][124] The second Artpop single, \"Do What U Want\", featured singer R. Kelly and was released later that month,[125] topping the charts in Hungary and reaching number 13 in the US.[48][126] Gaga removed the song from all streaming platforms in 2019 in the light of allegations made against Kelly sexually abusing several women; Gaga apologized for ever collaborating with him.[127] Artpop was released on November 6, 2013 to mixed reviews.[128] Helen Brown in The Daily Telegraph criticized Gaga for making another album about her fame and doubted the record's originality, but found it \"great for dancing\".[129] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, and sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide as of July 2014.[130][131] \"G.U.Y.\" was released as the third single in March 2014 and peaked at number 76 in the US.[48][132]\nGaga hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in November 2013, performing \"Do What U Want\" (with Kelly) and an album cut, \"Gypsy\".[134] After holding her second Thanksgiving Day television special on ABC, Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular, she performed a special rendition of \"Do What U Want\" with Christina Aguilera on the fifth season of the American reality talent show The Voice.[135][136] In March 2014, Gaga had a seven-day concert residency commemorating the last performance at New York's Roseland Ballroom before its closure.[137] Two months later, she embarked on the ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour, building on concepts from her ArtRave promotional event. Earning $83 million, the tour included cities canceled from the Born This Way Ball tour itinerary.[138] In the meantime, Gaga split from longtime manager Troy Carter over \"creative differences\",[139] and by June 2014, she and new manager Bobby Campbell joined Artist Nation, the artist management division of Live Nation Entertainment.[140] She briefly appeared in Rodriguez's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and was confirmed as Versace's spring-summer 2014 face with a campaign called \"Lady Gaga For Versace\".[141][142]\nIn September 2014, Gaga released a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett titled Cheek to Cheek. The inspiration behind the album came from her friendship with Bennett, and fascination with jazz music since her childhood.[143] Before the album was released, it produced the singles \"Anything Goes\" and \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\".[144] Cheek to Cheek received generally favorable reviews;[145] The Guardian's Caroline Sullivan praised Gaga's vocals and Howard Reich of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \"Cheek to Cheek serves up the real thing, start to finish\".[146][147] The record was Gaga's third consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200,[148] and won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.[149] The duo recorded the concert special Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live!,[150] and embarked on the Cheek to Cheek Tour from December 2014 to August 2015.[151]\nIn February 2015, Gaga became engaged to Taylor Kinney.[152] After Artpop's lukewarm response, Gaga began to redo her image and style. According to Billboard, this shift started with the release of Cheek to Cheek and the attention she received for her performance at the 87th Academy Awards, where she sang a medley of songs from The Sound of Music in a tribute to Julie Andrews.[133] Considered one of her best performances by Billboard, it triggered more than 214,000 interactions per minute globally on Facebook.[153][154] She and Diane Warren co-wrote the song \"Til It Happens to You\" for the documentary The Hunting Ground, which earned them the Satellite Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award nomination in the same category.[155] Gaga won Billboard Woman of the Year and Contemporary Icon Award at the 2015 Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards.[156][157]\nGaga had spent much of her early life wanting to be an actress, and achieved her goal when she starred in American Horror Story: Hotel.[158] Running from October 2015 to January 2016, Hotel is the fifth season of the television anthology horror series, American Horror Story, in which Gaga played a hotel owner named Elizabeth.[159][160] At the 73rd Golden Globe Awards, Gaga received the Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film award for her work on the season.[158] She appeared in Nick Knight's 2015 fashion film for Tom Ford's 2016 spring campaign[161] and was guest editor for V fashion magazine's 99th issue in January 2016, which featured 16 different covers.[162] She received Editor of the Year award at the Fashion Los Angeles Awards.[163]\nIn 2016, Gaga sang the US national anthem in February at Super Bowl 50,[164] partnered with Intel and Nile Rodgers for a tribute performance to the late David Bowie at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards,[165] and sang \"Til It Happens to You\" at the 88th Academy Awards, where she was introduced by Joe Biden and was accompanied on-stage by 50 people who had suffered from sexual assault.[166] She was honored that April with the Artist Award at the Jane Ortner Education Awards by The Grammy Museum, which recognizes artists who have demonstrated passion and dedication to education through the arts.[167] Her engagement to Taylor Kinney ended in July; she later said her career had interfered with their relationship.[168]\nGaga played a witch named Scathach in American Horror Story: Roanoke, the series' sixth season,[169] which ran from September to November 2016.[170][171] Her role in the fifth season of the show ultimately influenced her future music, prompting her to feature \"the art of darkness\".[172] In September 2016, she released her fifth album's lead single, \"Perfect Illusion\", which topped the charts in France and reached number 15 in the US.[173][174][175] The album, titled Joanne, was named after Gaga's late aunt, who was an inspiration for the music.[176] It was released on October 21, 2016, and became Gaga's fourth number one album on the Billboard 200, making her the first woman to reach the US chart's summit four times in the 2010s.[177] The album's second single, \"Million Reasons\", followed the next month and reached number four in the US.[175][178] She later released a piano version of the album's title track in 2018,[179] which won a Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance.[180] To promote the album, Gaga embarked on the three-date Dive Bar Tour.[181]\nGaga performed as the headlining act during the Super Bowl LI halftime show on February 5, 2017. Her performance featured a group of hundreds of lighted drones forming various shapes in the sky above Houston's NRG Stadium\u2014the first time robotic aircraft appeared in a Super Bowl program.[182] It attracted 117.5 million viewers in the United States, exceeding the game's total of 113.3 million viewers.[183] The performance led to a surge of 410,000 song downloads in the United States for Gaga and earned her an Emmy nomination in the Outstanding Special Class Program category.[184][185] CBS Sports included her performance as the second best in the history of Super Bowl halftime shows.[186] In April, Gaga headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[187] She also released a standalone-single, \"The Cure\", which reached the top 10 in Australia.[188][189] In August, Gaga began the Joanne World Tour, which she announced after the Super Bowl LI halftime show.[190] Gaga's creation of Joanne and preparation for her halftime show performance were featured in the documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two, which premiered on Netflix in September.[191] Throughout the film, she was seen suffering from chronic pain, which was later revealed to be the effect of a long-term condition called fibromyalgia.[192] It resulted in Gaga canceling the last ten shows of the Joanne World Tour, which ultimately grossed $95\u00a0million from 842,000 tickets sold.[193][194]\nIn March 2018, Gaga supported the March for Our Lives gun-control rally in Washington, D.C.,[195] and released a cover of Elton John's \"Your Song\" for his tribute album Revamp.[196] Later that year, she starred as a struggling singer named Ally in Bradley Cooper's critically acclaimed musical romantic drama A Star Is Born, a remake of the 1937 film of the same name. The film follows Ally's relationship with singer Jackson Maine (played by Cooper), which becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his.[197] Cooper approached Gaga after seeing her perform at a cancer research fundraiser; a fan of Cooper's work, Gaga agreed to the project due to its portrayal of addiction and depression.[198][199] A Star Is Born premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival in August 2018, and was released worldwide in October.[200] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described it as \"outrageously watchable\" and wrote that \"Gaga's ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level\".[201] Time's Stephanie Zacharek similarly highlighted her \"knockout performance\" and found her \"charismatic\" without her usual makeup, wigs and costumes.[202] Alongside her nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress, Gaga received the Critics' Choice and National Board of Review awards for the role.[203]\nGaga and Cooper co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the soundtrack for A Star Is Born, which she insisted they perform live in the film.[204] Its lead single, \"Shallow\", performed by the two, was released on September 27, 2018[205] and has reached number one in various nations including Australia, the UK and the US.[206] The soundtrack contains 34 tracks, including 19 original songs, and received generally positive reviews;[207] Mark Kennedy of The Washington Post called it a \"five-star marvel\" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian termed it an \"instant classics full of Gaga's emotional might\".[208][209] Commercially, the soundtrack debuted at number one in the US, making Gaga the first woman with five US number one albums in the 2010s, and breaking her tie with Taylor Swift as the most for any female artist this decade;[210] Swift tied with her again in 2019.[211] It additionally topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK.[212] As of June 2019, the soundtrack had sold over six million copies worldwide.[213] The album won Gaga four Grammy Awards\u2014Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media for \"Shallow\", as well as the latter category for \"I'll Never Love Again\"\u2014and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.[180][214][215] \"Shallow\" also earned her an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Original Song.[203]\nIn October, Gaga announced her engagement to talent agent Christian Carino whom she had met in early 2017.[216] They ended the engagement in February 2019.[217] Gaga signed a two-year residency, named Lady Gaga Enigma, to perform at the MGM Park Theater in Las Vegas.[218] The residency consists of two types of shows: Enigma, which focuses on theatricality and includes the singer's biggest hits,[219] and Jazz and Piano, which involves tracks from the Great American Songbook and stripped-down versions of Gaga's songs. The Enigma residency show opened in December 2018 and the Jazz and Piano in January 2019, with the residency due to last until May 2020.[220][221] Gaga launched her first, vegan makeup line, Haus Laboratories, in September 2019 exclusively on Amazon. Consisting of 40 products, including liquid eyeliners, lip glosses and face mask sticker, it reached number-one on Amazon's list of best-selling lipsticks.[222] She has also started working on her sixth studio album,[223] and was seen in recording studios with producers like Boys Noize, DJ White Shadow, BloodPop, and Sophie.[224] In October, she announced that the album would be titled Adele,[225] with several news outlets taking the announcement as a joke.[226][227]\nGaga is next committed to portray Patrizia Reggiani, who was convicted of hiring a hitman to murder her ex-husband and former head of the Gucci fashion house Maurizio Gucci, in an upcoming film directed by Ridley Scott.[228]\nGaga grew up listening to artists such as Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, the Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie and Garbage,[229][230] who have all influenced her music.[231][232] Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater.[30][233] She has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga.[234] Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music as Madonna has.[235] Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, specifically Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Marilyn Manson.[236][237][238][239] She credits Beyonc\u00e9 as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.[240]\nGaga was inspired by her mother to be interested in fashion, which she now says is a major influence and integrated with her music.[18][241] Stylistically, Gaga has been compared to Leigh Bowery, Isabella Blow, and Cher;[242][243] she once commented that as a child, she absorbed Cher's fashion sense and made it her own.[243] She considers Donatella Versace her muse and the British fashion designer Alexander McQueen as an inspiration.[91][244] In turn, Versace calls Lady Gaga \"the fresh Donatella\".[245] Gaga has also been influenced by Princess Diana, whom she has admired since her childhood.[246]\nGaga has called the Indian alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra a \"true inspiration\",[247] and has also quoted Indian leader Osho's book Creativity on Twitter. Gaga says she was influenced by Osho's work in valuing rebellion through creativity and equality.[248]\nCritics have analyzed and scrutinized Gaga's musical and performance style, as she has experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career. She says the continual reinvention is \"liberating\" herself, which she has been drawn to since childhood.[249] Gaga is a contralto with a range spanning from B\u266d2 to B5.[250][251][252] She has changed her vocal style regularly, and considers Born This Way \"much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of\".[253][254] In summing up her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power.\"[255]\nGaga's songs have been called \"depthless\" by writer Camille Paglia in The Sunday Times,[256] but according to Evan Sawdey of PopMatters, she \"does manage to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace\".[257] Gaga believes that \"all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit\".[258] Simon Reynolds wrote in 2010, \"Everything about Gaga came from electroclash, except the music, which wasn't particularly 1980s, just ruthlessly catchy naughties pop glazed with Auto-Tune and undergirded with R&amp;B-ish beats.\"[259]\nGaga's songs have covered a wide variety of concepts; The Fame discusses the lust for stardom, while the follow-up The Fame Monster expresses fame's dark side through monster metaphors. The Fame is an electropop and dance-pop album that has influences of 1980s pop and 1990s Europop,[260] whereas The Fame Monster displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on \"Seventies arena glam, perky ABBA disco, and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q\".[261] Born This Way has lyrics in English, French, German, and Spanish and features themes common to Gaga's controversial songwriting such as sex, love, religion, money, drugs, identity, liberation, sexuality, freedom, and individualism.[262] The album explores new genres, such as electronic rock and techno.[263]\nThe themes in Artpop revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, love, sex, feminism, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny.[264] Billboard describes Artpop as \"coherently channeling R&amp;B, techno, disco and rock music\".[265] With Cheek to Cheek, Gaga dabbled in the jazz genre.[266] Joanne, exploring the genres of country, funk, pop, dance, rock, electronic music and folk, was influenced by her personal life.[267] A Star Is Born contains elements of blues rock, country and bubblegum pop.[208] Billboard says its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as \"timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener.\"[268]\nFeaturing constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films.[269] The video for \"Telephone\" earned Gaga the Guinness World Record for Most Product Placement in a Video.[270] According to author Curtis Fogel, she explores bondage and sadomasochism and highlights prevalent feminist themes. The main themes of her music videos are sex, violence, and power. She calls herself \"a little bit of a feminist\" and asserts that she is \"sexually empowering women\".[271]\nGaga has called herself a perfectionist when it comes to her elaborate shows.[272] Her performances have been described as \"highly entertaining and innovative\";[273] the blood-spurting performance of \"Paparazzi\" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was described as \"eye-popping\" by MTV News.[274] She continued the blood-soaked theme during The Monster Ball Tour, causing protests in England from family groups and fans in the aftermath of the Cumbria shootings, in which a taxi driver had killed 12 people, then himself.[275] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Gaga appeared in drag as her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, and delivered a lovesick monologue before a performance of her song \"You and I\".[276] As Gaga's choreographer and creative director, Laurieann Gibson provided material for her shows and videos for four years before she was replaced by her assistant Richard Jackson in 2014.[277]\nIn an article for Billboard by Rebecca Schiller in October 2018, the author traced back Gaga's videography from \"Just Dance\" till the release of A Star Is Born. Schiller noted how, following the Artpop era, Gaga's stripped-down approach to music was reflected in the clips for the singles from Joanne, taking the example of the music video of lead single \"Perfect Illusion\" where the singer \"[ditched] the elaborate outfits for shorts and a tee-shirt as she performed the song at a desert party\". It continued with her performances in the film as well as her stage persona.[278]\nPublic reception of Gaga's music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina has offered a course titled \"Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame\" since early 2011 with the objective of unraveling \"some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga\".[280] When Gaga met briefly with then-president Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction \"intimidating\" as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman in the room.[281] When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for androgyny.[282] In a 2010 Sunday Times article, Camille Paglia called Gaga \"more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those\".[283]\nGaga's outlandish fashion sense has also served as an important aspect of her character.[242][244] During her early career, members of the media compared her fashion choices to those of Christina Aguilera.[244] In 2011, 121 women gathered at the Grammy Awards dressed in costumes similar to those worn by Gaga, earning the 2011 Guinness World Record for Largest Gathering of Lady Gaga Impersonators.[93] The Global Language Monitor named \"Lady Gaga\" as the Top Fashion Buzzword with her trademark \"no pants\" a close third.[284] Entertainment Weekly put her outfits on its end of the decade \"best-of\" list, saying that she \"brought performance art into the mainstream\".[285]\nTime placed Gaga on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons List, stating: \"Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits\u00a0... [Gaga] has sported outfits made from plastic bubbles, Kermit the Frog dolls, and raw meat.\"[286] Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, which was supplemented by boots, a purse, and a hat also made out of raw beef.[287] Partly awarded in recognition of the dress, Vogue named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 and Time named the dress the Fashion Statement of the year.[288][289] It attracted the attention of worldwide media; the animal rights organization PETA found it offensive.[290] The meat dress was displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in 2012,[291] and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 2015.[292]\nGaga's fans call her \"Mother Monster\", and she often refers to them as \"Little Monsters\", a phrase which she had tattooed on herself in dedication.[293] In his article \"Lady Gaga Pioneered Online Fandom Culture As We Know It\" for Vice, Jake Hall wrote that Gaga inspired several subsequent fan-brandings, such as those of Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Justin Bieber.[294] In July 2012, Gaga also co-founded the social networking service LittleMonsters.com, devoted to her fans.[295] According to Guinness World Records, Gaga was the most followed person on Twitter in 2011, as well as the most followed female pop singer and the most powerful popstar in 2014.[93][296] Forbes included Gaga on its Celebrity 100 from 2010 to 2015 and then from 2018 to 2019 and its list of the World's Most Powerful Women from 2010 to 2014.[297][298] She earned $62 million, $90 million, $52 million, $80 million, $33 million, and $59 million from 2010 through 2015, and $50 million and $39 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively.[299][300] She was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2010[301] and 2019,[302] and ranked second in most influential people of the past ten years in a Time magazine readers' poll in 2013.[303] In March 2012, Gaga was ranked fourth on Billboard's list of top moneymakers of 2011 with earnings of $25 million, which included sales from Born This Way and her Monster Ball Tour.[304] The following year, she topped Forbes' List of Top-Earning Celebs Under 30,[300] and in February 2016, the magazine estimated Gaga's net worth to be $275 million.[305] In December 2019, Gaga placed 10th on Forbes' list of Top-Earning Musicians Of The Decade with earnings of $500 million in the 2010s; she was the fourth highest-earning female musician on the list.[306]\nAfter declining an invitation to appear on the single \"We Are the World 25\" (because of rehearsals for her tour) to benefit victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Gaga donated the proceeds of her January 2010 Radio City Music Hall concert to the country's reconstruction relief fund.[307] All profits from her online store that day were also donated, and Gaga announced that $500,000 was collected for the fund.[308] Hours after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, Gaga tweeted a link to Japan Prayer Bracelets. All revenue from a bracelet she designed in conjunction with the company was donated to relief efforts;[309] these raised $1.5\u00a0million.[310] In June 2011, Gaga performed at MTV Japan's charity show in Makuhari Messe, which benefited the Japanese Red Cross.[311]\nIn 2012, Gaga joined the campaign group Artists Against Fracking.[312] That October, Yoko Ono gave Gaga and four other activists the LennonOno Grant for Peace in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland.[313] The following month, Gaga pledged to donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Gaga also contributes in the fight against HIV and AIDS, focusing on educating young women about the risks of the disease. In collaboration with Cyndi Lauper, Gaga joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam.[314] Sales have raised more than $202 million to fight HIV and AIDS.[315]\nIn April 2016, Gaga joined Vice President Joe Biden at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to support Biden's It's On Us campaign as he traveled to colleges on behalf of the organization, which has seen 250,000 students from more than 530 colleges sign a pledge of solidarity and activism.[316] Two months later, Gaga attended the 84th Annual US Conference of Mayors in Indianapolis where she joined with the Dalai Lama to talk about the power of kindness and how to make the world a more compassionate place.[317] Due to her meeting with Dalai Lama, the Chinese government added Gaga to a list of hostile foreign forces, and Chinese websites and media organizations were ordered to stop uploading or distributing her songs. The Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CCPPD) also issued an order for state-controlled media to condemn this meeting.[318]\nIn 2012, Gaga launched the Born This Way Foundation (BTWF), a non-profit organization that focuses on youth empowerment. It takes its name from her 2011 single and album. Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and US Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the foundation's inauguration at Harvard University.[319] The foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from Barneys New York.[320] In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with Office Depot, which donated 25% of the sales, a minimum of $1 million of a series of limited edition back-to-school products.[321] The foundation's initiatives have included the \"Born Brave Bus\" that followed her on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying.[322][323]\nIn October 2015, at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, Gaga joined 200 high school students, policy makers, and academic officials, including Peter Salovey, to discuss ways to recognize and channel emotions for positive outcomes.[324] In 2016, the foundation partnered with Intel, Vox Media, and Re/code to fight online harassment.[325] The sales revenue of the 99th issue of the V magazine, which featured Gaga and Kinney, was donated to the foundation.[162] Gaga and Elton John released the clothing and accessories line Love Bravery at Macy's in May. 25% of each purchase support Gaga's foundation and the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[326] Gaga partnered with Starbucks for a week in June 2017 with the \"Cups of Kindness\" campaign, where the company donated 25 cents from some of the beverages sold to the foundation.[327] She also appeared in a video by Staples Inc. to raise funds for the foundation and DonorsChoose.org.[328]\nOn the 2018 World Kindness Day, Gaga partnered with the foundation to bring food and relief to a Red Cross shelter for people who have been forced to evacuate homes due to the California wildfires. The foundation also partnered with Starbucks and SoulCycle to thank California firefighters for their relief work during the crisis. The singer had to previously evacuate her own home during the Woolsey Fire which spread through parts of Malibu.[329]\nIn March 2019, she penned a letter to supporters of the Born This Way Foundation, announcing the launch of a new pilot program for a teen mental health first aid project with the National Council for Behavioral Health. Gaga revealed her personal struggles with mental health in her letter and how she was able to get support which saved her life: \u201cI know what it means to have someone support me and understand what I\u2019m going through, and every young person in the world should have someone to turn to when they\u2019re hurting. It saved my life, and it will save theirs.\u201d[330][331]\nAs a bisexual woman,[c] Gaga actively supports LGBT rights worldwide.[332] She attributes much of her early success as a mainstream artist to her gay fans and is considered a gay icon.[333][334] Early in her career she had difficulty getting radio airplay, and stated, \"The turning point for me was the gay community.\"[335] She thanked FlyLife, a Manhattan-based LGBT marketing company with whom her label Interscope works, in the liner notes of The Fame.[336] One of her first televised performances was in May 2008 at the NewNowNext Awards, an awards show aired by the LGBT television network Logo.[337]\nGaga spoke at the 2009 National Equality March in Washington in support of the LGBT movement.[338] She attended the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards accompanied by four gay and lesbian former members of the United States Armed Forces who had been unable to serve openly under the US military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, which banned open homosexuality in the military.[339] Gaga urged her fans via YouTube to contact their senators in an effort to overturn the policy. In September 2010, she spoke at a Servicemembers Legal Defense Network's rally in Portland, Maine. Following this event, The Advocate named her a \"fierce advocate\" for gays and lesbians.[340] Gaga appeared at Europride, an international event dedicated to LGBT pride, in Rome in June 2011. She criticized the poor state of gay rights in many European countries and described gay people as \"revolutionaries of love\".[341] Gaga was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church Monastery so that she could officiate the wedding of two female friends.[342]\nIn June 2016, during a vigil held in Los Angeles for victims of the attack at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Gaga read aloud the names of the 49 people killed in the attack, and gave a speech.[343] Later that month, Gaga appeared in Human Rights Campaign's tribute video to the victims of the attack.[344] She has opposed the presidency of Donald Trump and deplored his military transgender ban.[345][346] She supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.[347] In 2018, a leaked memo from Trump's office revealed that his administration wanted to change the legal definition of sex in order to exclude transgender Americans. Gaga was one of the many celebrities to call him out and spread the #WontBeErased campaign to her 77 million Twitter followers.[348][349] In January 2019, during one of her Enigma shows, she called out Vice President Mike Pence for his wife Karen Pence working at a school where LGBTQ people are turned away.[350]\nGaga was named the \"Queen of Pop\" in a 2011 ranking by Rolling Stone (based on record sales and social media metrics), and she ranked fourth in VH1's Greatest Women in Music in 2012.[351][352] In 2012, she became a feature of a temporary exhibition The Elevated. From the Pharaoh to Lady Gaga marking the 150th anniversary of the National Museum in Warsaw.[353]\nGaga has been often regarded as a trailblazer for sometimes utilizing controversy to bring attention to various issues.[354][355] Because of The Fame's success\u2014it was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Debut Albums of All-Time by Rolling Stone in 2013[356]\u2014Gaga is acknowledged as one of the artists who propelled the rise in the popularity of synthpop in the late 2000s and early 2010s.[357] Scott Hardy, Polaroid's CEO, has praised Gaga for inspiring her fans and for her close interactions with them on social media.[358]\nAccording to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, \"Lady Gaga blazed a trail for truculent pop stars by treating her own celebrity as an evolving art project.\"[359] Including Born This Way as one of the 50 best female albums of all time, Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield considers it \"hard to remember a world where we didn't have Gaga, although we're pretty sure it was a lot more boring\".[360] In 2015, Time also noted that Gaga had \"practically invented the current era of pop music as spectacle\".[361] Her work has influenced artists including Miley Cyrus,[362] Nicki Minaj,[363] Ellie Goulding,[364] Halsey,[365] Jennifer Lopez,[366] Nick Jonas,[367] Sam Smith,[368] Noah Cyrus,[369] Katherine Langford,[370] MGMT,[371] and Greyson Chance.[372]\nA new genus of ferns, Gaga, and two species, G. germanotta and G. monstraparva, have been named in her honor. The name monstraparva alluded to Gaga's fans, known as \"little monsters\", since their symbol is the outstretched \"monster claw\" hand, which resembles a tightly rolled young fern leaf prior to unfurling.[373] Gaga also has an extinct mammal, Gagadon minimonstrum,[374] and a parasitic wasp, Aleiodes gaga, named for her.[375][376]\nGaga has won 11 Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Brit Awards,[377] two Golden Globe Awards, thirteen MTV Video Music Awards, various Guinness World Records, and the inaugural Songwriters Hall of Fame's Contemporary Icon Award.[157] She received a National Arts Awards' Young Artist Award, which honors individuals who have shown accomplishments and leadership early in their career,[378] and she won the Jane Ortner Artist Award from the Grammy Museum in 2016.[167] Gaga has also been recognized by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) with the Fashion Icon award,[379] and was a finalist for The Advocate's Person of the Year in 2016.[380] In 2019, she became the first person to win an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award in one year for her contribution to A Star Is Born's soundtrack.[381]\nGaga is one of the best-selling music artists with estimated sales of 27 million albums and 146 million singles as of January 2016.

                "text": "no title\n\nHarry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor. His musical career began in 2010 when he auditioned for the British singing competition The X Factor. He was eliminated early on, but was brought back to form the boy band One Direction. After the band's indefinite hiatus in 2016, Styles signed with Columbia Records as a solo artist. In 2017, Styles released his debut solo single, \"Sign of the Times\", which topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It was named \"Song of the Year\" by Rolling Stone, while its music video earned Styles a Brit Award. His self-titled debut album was released later in the year, topping the charts in fourteen countries and ranking in several music critics' year-end lists. Styles made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk (2017). His second album, Fine Line (2019), broke a record as the biggest sales debut from an English male artist in the US. Harry Edward Styles was born on 1 February 1994 in Redditch, Worcestershire.[1] He is the son of Anne Cox (n\u00e9e Selley) and Desmond \"Des\" Styles, who worked in finance.[2][3][4] Many of his ancestors were farm labourers in Norfolk.[5] Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, after his parents moved there along with his older sister, Gemma, when he was a child.[6] His earliest memory is of going to Disney World.[7] Styles attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School.[8] While at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive, he was the lead singer for the band White Eskimo, which won a local Battle of the Bands competition.[8][9] Styles' parents divorced when he was seven and his mother later was remarried to Robin Twist,[10] who died of cancer in 2017.[11] Styles has an older stepbrother named Mike and a stepsister named Amy, children of Twist.[11] As a child, Styles recorded covers on a karaoke machine he was given by his grandad, and the first song he recorded was Elvis Presley's \"The Girl of My Best Friend\".[12] As a sixteen-year-old, he worked part-time at the W. Mandeville Bakery in Holmes Chapel.[9] Following a suggestion from his mother, on 11 April 2010, Styles auditioned as a solo contestant for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor, singing a rendition of Stevie Wonder's \"Isn't She Lovely\".[3] He advanced to bootcamp, but failed to progress to the \"Boys\" category at \"judges' houses\". Four others in his age group also failed, but they were put together as an ensemble in July 2010, during the \"bootcamp\" stage of the competition, thus qualifying for the \"Groups\" category.[13] Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge,[14][15] and Simon Cowell have both claimed to have come up with the idea of forming the band.[16] The group consisting of Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik, got together for two weeks to practise.[17][18] Styles said he had suggested the name One Direction to his bandmates and they agreed to keep it.[19] Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition.[citation needed] The group quickly gained popularity in the UK.[20] In December 2010, One Direction finished The X Factor in third place behind Rebecca Ferguson and Matt Cardle, who won.[21] In January 2011, it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million Syco Records record contract.[22][23] One Direction's debut single, \"What Makes You Beautiful\", bowed at number one on the UK Singles Chart in September 2011,[24] and their first studio album, Up All Night, was released two months later. One Direction became the first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.[25][26] The album featured a multitude of writers, but included three songs written by Styles and his groupmates.[27] In November 2012, One Direction released their second album, Take Me Home, which spawned the group's second number one single in the UK, \"Little Things\".[28] Styles briefly dated American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift in the year of its release, leading to fan and media speculation about them writings songs about each other after their break-up.[3] At around this period, Styles lived in the attic of producer Ben Winston's home in Hampstead Heath, London, for 20 months while he looked for his own house.[3] One Direction: This Is Us, a documentary and concert film about the group directed by Morgan Spurlock, was released in 2013.[29][30] In November the same year, the group released their third album, Midnight Memories,[31] which spawned the hit singles \"Story of My Life\" and \"Best Song Ever\", the former being the first song co-written by Styles to be released as a single.[32][33] The album was the best-selling album of the year.[34] Following the album's release, the band embarked on the Where We Are Tour which was the highest-grossing tour of 2014 and is still the highest-grossing tour of all time by a vocal group.[35] Styles co-wrote the song \"Just a Little Bit of Your Heart\" for Ariana Grande's album, My Everything, released in August 2014.[36] Later in November, One Direction released their fourth album, Four,[37] which was the last to include Malik, due his exit from the group in early 2015.[38] One Direction became the only group in the 58-year history of the Billboard 200 albums chart to have their first four albums debut at number one.[39] In August 2015, the group confirmed rumours of an extended hiatus following the completion of their fifth album, Made in the A.M.,[40] and related promotional activities.[41][42][43] Styles said he had suggested the hiatus in late 2014 while working in the studio, not wanting to \"exhaust\" the fan base.[3] Over the course of their career, One Direction have sold 7.6 million albums and 26 million singles in the US,[33][44] and amassed seven BRIT Awards,[45] seven American Music Awards,[46] six Billboard Music Awards,[47] and four MTV Video Music Awards,[48] among others. In February 2016, Styles left One Direction's management company, Modest Management, and joined Jeffrey Azoff's Full Stop Management.[49] Styles launched his own record label, Erskine Records, in May and signed a recording contract with Columbia Records as a solo artist, the same label behind One Direction, in June.[49][50] Styles co-wrote the song \"Someday\" with Meghan Trainor for Michael Bubl\u00e9's album, Nobody but Me, released in October.[51] Recording for Styles' debut album took place throughout 2016 in Los Angeles, London, and Port Antonio, Jamaica, where Styles and his collaborators had a two-month writing retreat in the autumn.[3] Jeff Bhasker executive produced the album, and Alex Salibian, Tyler Johnson, and Kid Harpoon served as producers.[52] In March 2017, Styles announced his first solo single, \"Sign of the Times\", would be released on 7 April.[53] The song subsequently peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number four on the Billboard Hot 100.[54][55] The song is a glam rock influenced soft rock power ballad,[56][57] and has frequently drawn comparisons with the work of David Bowie.[58] Rolling Stone ranked it as the best song of 2017.[59] The song's music video featured him flying and walking on water,[60][61] and won the Brit Award for British Video of the Year.[62] In April, Styles was a musical guest on Saturday Night Live in the US and made his debut televised solo performance in his native country on The Graham Norton Show.[63][64] His self-titled debut album was released in May 2017,[65] whereupon it debuted at number one in several countries, including the UK, US, and Australia.[66] The record was heavily influenced by 1970s soft rock and was described by Variety as a \"classic cocktail of psychedelia, Britpop, and balladry\".[67][68] The other singles from the album are \"Two Ghosts\" and \"Kiwi\".[69][70] Harry Styles received generally favourable reviews from critics,[71][72] and was included in several publications' lists of the best albums of 2017.[73][74][75] The film, Harry Styles: Behind the Album, which documented the writing and recording process for the album, was released in May exclusively on Apple Music.[76] In support of the album, Styles embarked on his first headlining concert tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour, from September 2017 through to July 2018, performing in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.[77][78] The tour setlist included covers of Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain\", several One Direction songs, as well as previously unreleased material.[79][80] Styles made his film debut in Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk, in July 2017 playing a British soldier named Alex who is a part of the Dunkirk evacuation in World War II.[81] He appeared alongside an ensemble cast which included Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy.[82] Styles beat out more than one hundred other candidates auditioning for the part;[83] Nolan later stated he was unaware of the extent of his fame and that Styles was cast \"because he fit the part wonderfully and truly earned a seat at the table.\"[84][85] The Daily Telegraph film critic, Robbie Collin, praised Styles for his \"bright, convicted, and unexpectedly not-at-all-jarring performance\".[86] In November, BBC One broadcast Harry Styles at the BBC, a one-hour television special presented by Nick Grimshaw.[87] Styles guest hosted The Late Late Show with James Corden in December.[88] Together with Jack Antonoff and Ilsey Juber, Styles co-wrote \"Alfie's Song (Not So Typical Love Song)\", performed by the band Bleachers, for the soundtrack of the film Love, Simon (2018).[89] Styles serves as an executive producer on the CBS sitcom Happy Together, which premiered in October 2018 and was inspired by Styles' time living with television producer Ben Winston.[90] In 2018, Styles began modelling for Gucci, appearing in several campaigns for the luxury Italian brand.[91][92] \"Lights Up\", the lead single from Style's second album Fine Line, was released in October 2019, debuting in third place in the UK.[93][94] The song features a \"soft-touch re-entry into the pop slipstream\" according to music writer Jon Caramanica.[95] Styles performed \"double duty\" as host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live in November.[96] He also once again guest hosted The Late Late Show with James Corden in December.[97][98] Fine Line was released the same month, preceded by the second and third singles, \"Watermelon Sugar\" and \"Adore You\", which peaked respectively at numbers 17 and 7 in the UK.[99][100][101] The album debuted at number three in the UK and topped the US charts, breaking the record as the biggest sales debut from an English male artist in the US.[102][a] Fine Line was recorded at the Shangri-La studio in Malibu, California with the same production team behind Styles' debut album.[104] It features a similar sound sonically to Harry Styles, while incorporating additional elements of funk and soul.[105] At the 2020 Brit Awards, Styles was nominated for British Male Solo Artist and British Album of the Year.[106] A tour to support the album, named Love On Tour, is scheduled to take place throughout 2020.[107] Styles' music contain elements of soft rock, pop, folk, rock, and Britpop.[108][109][110][111] His musical style on his debut solo album was described as having an \"intimately emotional Seventies soft-rock vibe\" by Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield and \"synthesis[ing] influences from the last half-century of rock\" by Time magazine.[112][113] Styles has cited country singer Shania Twain as his \"main influence\" both musically and in fashion.[114] He has also cited Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Harry Nilsson, Freddie Mercury, Queen and Elvis Presley as influences.[115][116][117] Styles praised Nilsson's lyrics as being \"honest, and so good, and I think it's because he's never trying to sound clever.\"[116] Upon listening to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon as a child, he said he \"couldn't really get it, but I just remember being like \u2013 this is really fucking cool.\"[3] Regarding Styles' time in One Direction, AllMusic writer Tim Sendra opined his \"charming persona and elastic vocals had him positioned as the Timberlake of the group.\"[118] Styles seemed \"a dimpled, rakish prankster happy to wear the mantle of Class Clown... maybe because he knew that Most Likely to Succeed belonged to him too,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt.[119] During public appearances, Styles' fashion evolution has traded \"teen-friendly\" Jack Wills tracksuits for a selection of Saint Laurent, Burberry and Gucci, appearing in a number of campaigns for the latter.[120][121] As his time in the band progressed, the singer started wearing skinny jeans and boots.[120] For Billboard's Chris Payne, \"From his influences to his fashion to his onstage persona to his (formerly) flowing locks, Styles' vibe has always screamed rock star.\"[122] The same publication noted over the course of his five-year stint with the group, Styles' taste in fashion \"has blossomed from a teen wearing purple Jack Wills hoodies to a carefully executed blend of '70s rock with a glamorous magpie feel.\"[123] In September 2016, Styles appeared on the cover of Another Man magazine, prompting an editor from The Guardian to label the lack of shirtlessness and the focus on fashion for a niche publication as the death of a \"heartthrob\" and birth of an \"artthrob\".[124][125] During his debut solo album promotions in 2017, Styles opted for \"candyfloss\" pink suits, printed satin flares, gradually heightening heels, a style described as \"flamboyant look\".[120] Regarding his favouritism for pink, he quoted The Clash's Paul Simonon in an interview: \"Pink is the only true rock & roll colour.\"[3] According to fashion designer Michael Kors, \"Harry is the modern embodiment of British rocker style: edgy, flamboyant and worn with unapologetic swagger.\"[126] He was ranked first and fifth in 2016 and 2017 respectively on British Vogue's \"The 50 Fittest Boys\".[127][128] He was voted the \"Sexiest Male in Pop\" for 2016, 2017, and 2018 in a poll by British radio network Capital.[129][130][131] In 2018, Styles was voted fourth by British GQ on their list of \"50 best-dressed men\".[126] Styles was in a relationship with The Xtra Factor presenter Caroline Flack from November 2011 to January 2012, which caused controversy and criticism over their 14-year age gap.[132] Styles also dated American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift later in 2012,[133] and model Camille Rowe for a year until 2018.[134][135] He resides in London.[136] Styles believes in karma. When Chelsea Handler asked if he believes in God, he responded \"I feel like anyone who says, 'I'm spiritual' sounds a little wanky. But yeah, I definitely consider myself to be more spiritual than religious. I'm not super tied-in to certain rules but I think it's na\u00efve to say nothing exists and there's nothing above us or more powerful than us. I think that's a little narrow-minded.\" He added \"I definitely think there's something, that it's not just us. It's kind of crazy to think that it's just us.\"[137] Styles has dozens of tattoos and had the words \"Late Late\" tattooed onto his arm during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2015.[138] In May 2019, Styles was named second on the Sunday Times Rich List of musicians in the UK under 30, with an estimated net worth of \u00a358 million, having previously featured third on the previous year's list.[139][140] Styles' sexuality has long been a subject of speculation.[141] When questioned during a GQ interview whether he was bisexual, Styles responded: \"I'm pretty sure I'm not.\"[142] He later affirmed in 2017 that he did not \"feel any need to label his sexuality or identify with one sexual orientation.\"[143] In December 2019, when asked about his flamboyant image and sexual ambiguity, Styles stated: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}\"Am I sprinkling in nuggets of sexual ambiguity to try and be more interesting? No. [...] in terms of how I wanna dress, and what the album sleeve\u2019s gonna be, I tend to make decisions in terms of collaborators I want to work with. I want things to look a certain way. Not because it makes me look gay, or it makes me look straight, or it makes me look bisexual, but because I think it looks cool. And more than that, I dunno, I just think sexuality\u2019s something that\u2019s fun. Honestly? I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve given it any more thought than that.\"[144] In 2013, Styles along with One Direction member Liam Payne became ambassadors for the cancer charity Trekstock, and raised more than $800,000 through the online fundraising platform Prizeo.[145][146] In 2015, Styles sponsored water wells in India via Drop4Drop in support of Life Water's World Water Day campaign.[147] In 2016, Styles donated his hair to the UK charity Little Princess Trust, which supplies and funds wigs made of real hair to children who have hair loss as a result of illnesses.[148] In May 2017, to celebrate the release of his debut album, Styles played intimate shows at The Garage in London and the Troubadour in Los Angeles, with all proceeds benefiting charities.[149][150] In October 2017, Styles alongside other artists performed at CBS Radio's We Can Survive concert at the Hollywood Bowl for breast cancer awareness.[151] Styles' first tour raised $1.2 million in charity donations from ticket sales, Live Nation's contributions, and GLSEN's Pride campaign toward 62 charities around the world. It also promoted water conservation via recycling and reducing plastic water bottle usage.[152][153] Styles has showed support to the LGBT community by waving the rainbow flag on stage, wearing LGBT-themed clothing and supporting LGBT fans in concerts.[154] In 2018, he released T-shirts with the slogan \"Treat People With Kindness\" in a rainbow print in celebration of Pride Month, with all proceeds benefiting GLSEN.[155] He has also added \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"End Gun Violence\" stickers to his guitar.[156] He tweeted in support of the March for Our Lives petition and actress Emma Watson's HeForShe gender equality campaign.[157][158] In December 2019, Styles said in response to not using his influence more to support specific causes: \"Because of dilution. Because I\u2019d prefer, when I say something, for people to think I mean it. To be honest, I\u2019m still searching for that one thing, y\u2019know. Something I can really stand up for, and get behind, and be like: This Is My Life Fight. There\u2019s a power to doing the one thing. You want your whole weight behind it.\"[144] He\u2019s also vegan.[159]",

His musical career began in 2010 when he auditioned for the British singing competition The X Factor. He was eliminated early on, but was brought back to form the boy band One Direction. After the band's indefinite hiatus in 2016, Styles signed with Columbia Records as a solo artist. \nIn 2017, Styles released his debut solo single, \"Sign of the Times\", which topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It was named \"Song of the Year\" by Rolling Stone, while its music video earned Styles a Brit Award. His self-titled debut album was released later in the year, topping the charts in fourteen countries and ranking in several music critics' year-end lists. Styles made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk (2017). His second album, Fine Line (2019), broke a record as the biggest sales debut from an English male artist in the US.\nHarry Edward Styles was born on 1 February 1994 in Redditch, Worcestershire.[1] He is the son of Anne Cox (n\u00e9e Selley) and Desmond \"Des\" Styles, who worked in finance.[2][3][4] Many of his ancestors were farm labourers in Norfolk.[5] Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, after his parents moved there along with his older sister, Gemma, when he was a child.[6] His earliest memory is of going to Disney World.[7] Styles attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School.[8] While at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive, he was the lead singer for the band White Eskimo, which won a local Battle of the Bands competition.[8][9] Styles' parents divorced when he was seven and his mother later was remarried to Robin Twist,[10] who died of cancer in 2017.[11] Styles has an older stepbrother named Mike and a stepsister named Amy, children of Twist.[11]\nAs a child, Styles recorded covers on a karaoke machine he was given by his grandad, and the first song he recorded was Elvis Presley's \"The Girl of My Best Friend\".[12] As a sixteen-year-old, he worked part-time at the W. Mandeville Bakery in Holmes Chapel.[9]\nFollowing a suggestion from his mother, on 11 April 2010, Styles auditioned as a solo contestant for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor, singing a rendition of Stevie Wonder's \"Isn't She Lovely\".[3] He advanced to bootcamp, but failed to progress to the \"Boys\" category at \"judges' houses\". Four others in his age group also failed, but they were put together as an ensemble in July 2010, during the \"bootcamp\" stage of the competition, thus qualifying for the \"Groups\" category.[13] Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge,[14][15] and Simon Cowell have both claimed to have come up with the idea of forming the band.[16] The group consisting of Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik, got together for two weeks to practise.[17][18] Styles said he had suggested the name One Direction to his bandmates and they agreed to keep it.[19] Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition.[citation needed] The group quickly gained popularity in the UK.[20] In December 2010, One Direction finished The X Factor in third place behind Rebecca Ferguson and Matt Cardle, who won.[21]\nIn January 2011, it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million Syco Records record contract.[22][23] One Direction's debut single, \"What Makes You Beautiful\", bowed at number one on the UK Singles Chart in September 2011,[24] and their first studio album, Up All Night, was released two months later. One Direction became the first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.[25][26] The album featured a multitude of writers, but included three songs written by Styles and his groupmates.[27] In November 2012, One Direction released their second album, Take Me Home, which spawned the group's second number one single in the UK, \"Little Things\".[28] Styles briefly dated American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift in the year of its release, leading to fan and media speculation about them writings songs about each other after their break-up.[3] At around this period, Styles lived in the attic of producer Ben Winston's home in Hampstead Heath, London, for 20 months while he looked for his own house.[3]\nOne Direction: This Is Us, a documentary and concert film about the group directed by Morgan Spurlock, was released in 2013.[29][30] In November the same year, the group released their third album, Midnight Memories,[31] which spawned the hit singles \"Story of My Life\" and \"Best Song Ever\", the former being the first song co-written by Styles to be released as a single.[32][33] The album was the best-selling album of the year.[34] Following the album's release, the band embarked on the Where We Are Tour which was the highest-grossing tour of 2014 and is still the highest-grossing tour of all time by a vocal group.[35] Styles co-wrote the song \"Just a Little Bit of Your Heart\" for Ariana Grande's album, My Everything, released in August 2014.[36] Later in November, One Direction released their fourth album, Four,[37] which was the last to include Malik, due his exit from the group in early 2015.[38] One Direction became the only group in the 58-year history of the Billboard 200 albums chart to have their first four albums debut at number one.[39] In August 2015, the group confirmed rumours of an extended hiatus following the completion of their fifth album, Made in the A.M.,[40] and related promotional activities.[41][42][43] Styles said he had suggested the hiatus in late 2014 while working in the studio, not wanting to \"exhaust\" the fan base.[3] Over the course of their career, One Direction have sold 7.6 million albums and 26 million singles in the US,[33][44] and amassed seven BRIT Awards,[45] seven American Music Awards,[46] six Billboard Music Awards,[47] and four MTV Video Music Awards,[48] among others.\nIn February 2016, Styles left One Direction's management company, Modest Management, and joined Jeffrey Azoff's Full Stop Management.[49] Styles launched his own record label, Erskine Records, in May and signed a recording contract with Columbia Records as a solo artist, the same label behind One Direction, in June.[49][50] Styles co-wrote the song \"Someday\" with Meghan Trainor for Michael Bubl\u00e9's album, Nobody but Me, released in October.[51] Recording for Styles' debut album took place throughout 2016 in Los Angeles, London, and Port Antonio, Jamaica, where Styles and his collaborators had a two-month writing retreat in the autumn.[3] Jeff Bhasker executive produced the album, and Alex Salibian, Tyler Johnson, and Kid Harpoon served as producers.[52] In March 2017, Styles announced his first solo single, \"Sign of the Times\", would be released on 7 April.[53] The song subsequently peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number four on the Billboard Hot 100.[54][55] The song is a glam rock influenced soft rock power ballad,[56][57] and has frequently drawn comparisons with the work of David Bowie.[58] Rolling Stone ranked it as the best song of 2017.[59] The song's music video featured him flying and walking on water,[60][61] and won the Brit Award for British Video of the Year.[62] In April, Styles was a musical guest on Saturday Night Live in the US and made his debut televised solo performance in his native country on The Graham Norton Show.[63][64]\nHis self-titled debut album was released in May 2017,[65] whereupon it debuted at number one in several countries, including the UK, US, and Australia.[66] The record was heavily influenced by 1970s soft rock and was described by Variety as a \"classic cocktail of psychedelia, Britpop, and balladry\".[67][68] The other singles from the album are \"Two Ghosts\" and \"Kiwi\".[69][70] Harry Styles received generally favourable reviews from critics,[71][72] and was included in several publications' lists of the best albums of 2017.[73][74][75] The film, Harry Styles: Behind the Album, which documented the writing and recording process for the album, was released in May exclusively on Apple Music.[76] In support of the album, Styles embarked on his first headlining concert tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour, from September 2017 through to July 2018, performing in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.[77][78] The tour setlist included covers of Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain\", several One Direction songs, as well as previously unreleased material.[79][80]\nStyles made his film debut in Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk, in July 2017 playing a British soldier named Alex who is a part of the Dunkirk evacuation in World War II.[81] He appeared alongside an ensemble cast which included Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy.[82] Styles beat out more than one hundred other candidates auditioning for the part;[83] Nolan later stated he was unaware of the extent of his fame and that Styles was cast \"because he fit the part wonderfully and truly earned a seat at the table.\"[84][85] The Daily Telegraph film critic, Robbie Collin, praised Styles for his \"bright, convicted, and unexpectedly not-at-all-jarring performance\".[86]\nIn November, BBC One broadcast Harry Styles at the BBC, a one-hour television special presented by Nick Grimshaw.[87] Styles guest hosted The Late Late Show with James Corden in December.[88] Together with Jack Antonoff and Ilsey Juber, Styles co-wrote \"Alfie's Song (Not So Typical Love Song)\", performed by the band Bleachers, for the soundtrack of the film Love, Simon (2018).[89] Styles serves as an executive producer on the CBS sitcom Happy Together, which premiered in October 2018 and was inspired by Styles' time living with television producer Ben Winston.[90] In 2018, Styles began modelling for Gucci, appearing in several campaigns for the luxury Italian brand.[91][92]\n\"Lights Up\", the lead single from Style's second album Fine Line, was released in October 2019, debuting in third place in the UK.[93][94] The song features a \"soft-touch re-entry into the pop slipstream\" according to music writer Jon Caramanica.[95] Styles performed \"double duty\" as host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live in November.[96] He also once again guest hosted The Late Late Show with James Corden in December.[97][98] Fine Line was released the same month, preceded by the second and third singles, \"Watermelon Sugar\" and \"Adore You\", which peaked respectively at numbers 17 and 7 in the UK.[99][100][101] The album debuted at number three in the UK and topped the US charts, breaking the record as the biggest sales debut from an English male artist in the US.[102][a] Fine Line was recorded at the Shangri-La studio in Malibu, California with the same production team behind Styles' debut album.[104] It features a similar sound sonically to Harry Styles, while incorporating additional elements of funk and soul.[105] At the 2020 Brit Awards, Styles was nominated for British Male Solo Artist and British Album of the Year.[106] A tour to support the album, named Love On Tour, is scheduled to take place throughout 2020.[107]\nStyles' music contain elements of soft rock, pop, folk, rock, and Britpop.[108][109][110][111] His musical style on his debut solo album was described as having an \"intimately emotional Seventies soft-rock vibe\" by Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield and \"synthesis[ing] influences from the last half-century of rock\" by Time magazine.[112][113] Styles has cited country singer Shania Twain as his \"main influence\" both musically and in fashion.[114] He has also cited Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Harry Nilsson, Freddie Mercury, Queen and Elvis Presley as influences.[115][116][117] Styles praised Nilsson's lyrics as being \"honest, and so good, and I think it's because he's never trying to sound clever.\"[116] Upon listening to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon as a child, he said he \"couldn't really get it, but I just remember being like \u2013 this is really fucking cool.\"[3]\nRegarding Styles' time in One Direction, AllMusic writer Tim Sendra opined his \"charming persona and elastic vocals had him positioned as the Timberlake of the group.\"[118] Styles seemed \"a dimpled, rakish prankster happy to wear the mantle of Class Clown... maybe because he knew that Most Likely to Succeed belonged to him too,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt.[119] During public appearances, Styles' fashion evolution has traded \"teen-friendly\" Jack Wills tracksuits for a selection of Saint Laurent, Burberry and Gucci, appearing in a number of campaigns for the latter.[120][121]\nAs his time in the band progressed, the singer started wearing skinny jeans and boots.[120] For Billboard's Chris Payne, \"From his influences to his fashion to his onstage persona to his (formerly) flowing locks, Styles' vibe has always screamed rock star.\"[122] The same publication noted over the course of his five-year stint with the group, Styles' taste in fashion \"has blossomed from a teen wearing purple Jack Wills hoodies to a carefully executed blend of '70s rock with a glamorous magpie feel.\"[123] In September 2016, Styles appeared on the cover of Another Man magazine, prompting an editor from The Guardian to label the lack of shirtlessness and the focus on fashion for a niche publication as the death of a \"heartthrob\" and birth of an \"artthrob\".[124][125] During his debut solo album promotions in 2017, Styles opted for \"candyfloss\" pink suits, printed satin flares, gradually heightening heels, a style described as \"flamboyant look\".[120] Regarding his favouritism for pink, he quoted The Clash's Paul Simonon in an interview: \"Pink is the only true rock &amp; roll colour.\"[3] According to fashion designer Michael Kors, \"Harry is the modern embodiment of British rocker style: edgy, flamboyant and worn with unapologetic swagger.\"[126]\nHe was ranked first and fifth in 2016 and 2017 respectively on British Vogue's \"The 50 Fittest Boys\".[127][128] He was voted the \"Sexiest Male in Pop\" for 2016, 2017, and 2018 in a poll by British radio network Capital.[129][130][131] In 2018, Styles was voted fourth by British GQ on their list of \"50 best-dressed men\".[126]\nStyles was in a relationship with The Xtra Factor presenter Caroline Flack from November 2011 to January 2012, which caused controversy and criticism over their 14-year age gap.[132] Styles also dated American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift later in 2012,[133] and model Camille Rowe for a year until 2018.[134][135] He resides in London.[136]\nStyles believes in karma. When Chelsea Handler asked if he believes in God, he responded \"I feel like anyone who says, 'I'm spiritual' sounds a little wanky. But yeah, I definitely consider myself to be more spiritual than religious. I'm not super tied-in to certain rules but I think it's na\u00efve to say nothing exists and there's nothing above us or more powerful than us. I think that's a little narrow-minded.\" He added \"I definitely think there's something, that it's not just us. It's kind of crazy to think that it's just us.\"[137]\nStyles has dozens of tattoos and had the words \"Late Late\" tattooed onto his arm during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2015.[138] In May 2019, Styles was named second on the Sunday Times Rich List of musicians in the UK under 30, with an estimated net worth of \u00a358 million, having previously featured third on the previous year's list.[139][140]\n\nStyles' sexuality has long been a subject of speculation.[141] When questioned during a GQ interview whether he was bisexual, Styles responded: \"I'm pretty sure I'm not.\"[142] He later affirmed in 2017 that he did not \"feel any need to label his sexuality or identify with one sexual orientation.\"[143] In December 2019, when asked about his flamboyant image and sexual ambiguity, Styles stated: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}\"Am I sprinkling in nuggets of sexual ambiguity to try and be more interesting? No. [...] in terms of how I wanna dress, and what the album sleeve\u2019s gonna be, I tend to make decisions in terms of collaborators I want to work with. I want things to look a certain way. Not because it makes me look gay, or it makes me look straight, or it makes me look bisexual, but because I think it looks cool. And more than that, I dunno, I just think sexuality\u2019s something that\u2019s fun. Honestly? I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve given it any more thought than that.\"[144]\nIn 2013, Styles along with One Direction member Liam Payne became ambassadors for the cancer charity Trekstock, and raised more than $800,000 through the online fundraising platform Prizeo.[145][146] In 2015, Styles sponsored water wells in India via Drop4Drop in support of Life Water's World Water Day campaign.[147] In 2016, Styles donated his hair to the UK charity Little Princess Trust, which supplies and funds wigs made of real hair to children who have hair loss as a result of illnesses.[148] In May 2017, to celebrate the release of his debut album, Styles played intimate shows at The Garage in London and the Troubadour in Los Angeles, with all proceeds benefiting charities.[149][150] In October 2017, Styles alongside other artists performed at CBS Radio's We Can Survive concert at the Hollywood Bowl for breast cancer awareness.[151] Styles' first tour raised $1.2 million in charity donations from ticket sales, Live Nation's contributions, and GLSEN's Pride campaign toward 62 charities around the world. It also promoted water conservation via recycling and reducing plastic water bottle usage.[152][153]\n\nStyles has showed support to the LGBT community by waving the rainbow flag on stage, wearing LGBT-themed clothing and supporting LGBT fans in concerts.[154] In 2018, he released T-shirts with the slogan \"Treat People With Kindness\" in a rainbow print in celebration of Pride Month, with all proceeds benefiting GLSEN.[155] He has also added \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"End Gun Violence\" stickers to his guitar.[156] He tweeted in support of the March for Our Lives petition and actress Emma Watson's HeForShe gender equality campaign.[157][158] In December 2019, Styles said in response to not using his influence more to support specific causes: \"Because of dilution. Because I\u2019d prefer, when I say something, for people to think I mean it. To be honest, I\u2019m still searching for that one thing, y\u2019know. Something I can really stand up for, and get behind, and be like: This Is My Life Fight. There\u2019s a power to doing the one thing. You want your whole weight behind it.\"[144]\nHe\u2019s also vegan.[159]\n</body></html>"
