                "text": "no title\n\nAvram Noam Chomsky[a] (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian,[b][c] social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\",[d] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Laureate Professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. Born to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner. An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\". Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of freedom of speech, including Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017. One of the most cited scholars alive,[20] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proven highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism. Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[21] His parents, Ze'ev \"William\" Chomsky and Elsie Simonofsky, were Jewish immigrants.[22] William had fled the Russian Empire in 1913 to escape conscription and worked in Baltimore sweatshops and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university.[23] After moving to Philadelphia, William became principal of the Congregation Mikveh Israel religious school and joined the Gratz College faculty. He placed great emphasis on educating people so that they would be \"well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all\", a mission that shaped and was subsequently adopted by his son.[24] Elsie was a teacher and activist born in Belarus. They met at Mikveh Israel, where they both worked.[22] Noam was the Chomskys' first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later, in 1934.[25][26] The brothers were close, though David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive.[27] Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of Zionism; the family was particularly influenced by the Left Zionist writings of Ahad Ha'am.[26] Chomsky faced antisemitism as a child, particularly from Philadelphia's Irish and German communities.[28] Chomsky attended the independent, Deweyite Oak Lane Country Day School[29] and Philadelphia's Central High School, where he excelled academically and joined various clubs and societies, but was troubled by the school's hierarchical and regimented teaching methods.[30] He also attended Hebrew High School at Gratz College, where his father taught.[31] Chomsky has described his parents as \"normal Roosevelt Democrats\" with center-left politics, but other relatives involved in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union exposed him to socialism and far-left politics.[32] He was substantially influenced by his uncle and the Jewish leftists who frequented his New York City newspaper stand to debate current affairs.[33] Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores when visiting his uncle in the city, voraciously reading political literature.[34] He wrote his first article at age 10 on the spread of fascism following the fall of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War[35] and, from the age of 12 or 13, identified with anarchist politics.[31] He later described his discovery of anarchism as \"a lucky accident\"[36] that made him critical of Stalinism and other forms of Marxism\u2013Leninism.[37] In 1945, aged 16, Chomsky began a general program of study at the University of Pennsylvania, where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning Arabic.[38] Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.[39] Frustrated with his experiences at the university, he considered dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine,[40] but his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.[41] Chomsky's BA honors thesis, \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\", applied Harris's methods to the language.[42] Chomsky revised this thesis for his MA, which he received from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951; it was subsequently published as a book.[43] He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of Nelson Goodman.[44] From 1951 to 1955 Chomsky was a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where he undertook research on what became his doctoral dissertation.[45] Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,[46] Chomsky was attracted to Harvard in part because the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, J. L. Austin of the University of Oxford, strongly influenced Chomsky.[47] In 1952 Chomsky published his first academic article, Systems of Syntactic Analysis, which appeared not in a journal of linguistics but in The Journal of Symbolic Logic.[46] Highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures at the University of Chicago and Yale University.[48] He had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, but in 1955 he submitted a thesis setting out his ideas on transformational grammar; he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree for it, and it was privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in 1975 as part of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory.[49] Harvard professor George Armitage Miller was impressed by Chomsky's thesis and collaborated with him on several technical papers in mathematical linguistics.[50] Chomsky's doctorate exempted him from compulsory military service, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.[51] In 1947 Chomsky began a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz, whom he had known since early childhood. They married in 1949.[52] After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to the Allston area of Boston and remained there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of Lexington.[53] In 1953 the couple took a Harvard travel grant to Europe, from the United Kingdom through France, Switzerland into Italy,[54] and Israel, where they lived in Hashomer Hatzair's HaZore'a kibbutz. Despite enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the country's Jewish nationalism, anti-Arab racism and, within the kibbutz's leftist community, pro-Stalinism.[55] On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of the Yiddish anarchist journal Fraye Arbeter Shtime and became enamored with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker, a contributor whose work introduced Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism.[56] Chomsky also read other political thinkers: the anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n, democratic socialists George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, and Dwight Macdonald, and works by Marxists Karl Liebknecht, Karl Korsch, and Rosa Luxemburg.[57] His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the Spanish Civil War, as documented in Orwell's Homage to Catalonia (1938).[58] He read the leftist journal Politics, which furthered his interest in anarchism,[59] and the council communist periodical Living Marxism, though he rejected the orthodoxy of its editor, Paul Mattick.[60] He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the Leninist League of the United States, an anti-Stalinist Marxist\u2013Leninist group, sharing their view that the Second World War was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's \"state capitalists\" to crush Europe's proletariat.[61] Chomsky befriended two linguists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson, the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position there in 1955. At MIT, Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project and half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy.[62] He described MIT as \"a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work.\"[63] In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor.[64] The Chomskys had their first child that same year, a daughter named Aviva.[65] He also published his first book on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris\u2013Bloomfield trend in the field.[66] Responses to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused \"significant upheaval\" in the discipline.[67] The linguist John Lyons later asserted that Syntactic Structures \"revolutionized the scientific study of language\".[68] From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[69] In 1959 Chomsky published a review of B. F. Skinner's 1957 book Verbal Behavior in the academic journal Language, in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior.[70][71] The review argued that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics and helped to establish Chomsky as an intellectual.[72] With Halle, Chomsky proceeded to found MIT's graduate program in linguistics. In 1961 he was awarded tenure, becoming a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.[73] Chomsky went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists, held in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which established him as the de facto spokesperson of American linguistics.[74] Between 1963 and 1965 he consulted on a military-sponsored project \"to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control\"; Barbara Partee, a collaborator on this project and then-student of Chomsky, has said this research was justified to the military on the basis that \"in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program.\"[75] Chomsky continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar (1966), and Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966).[76] Along with Halle, he also edited the Studies in Language series of books for Harper and Row.[77] As he began to accrue significant academic recognition and honors for his work, Chomsky lectured at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966.[78] His Beckman lectures at Berkeley were assembled and published as Language and Mind in 1968.[79] Despite his growing stature, an intellectual falling-out between Chomsky and some of his early colleagues and doctoral students\u2014including Paul Postal, John \"Haj\" Ross, George Lakoff, and James D. McCawley\u2014triggered a series of academic debates that came to be known as the \"Linguistics Wars\", although they revolved largely around philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.[80] Chomsky on the Vietnam War[81] Chomsky joined protests against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes.[82] His 1967 critique of U.S. involvement, \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\", among other contributions to The New York Review of Books, debuted Chomsky as a public dissident.[83] This essay and other political articles were collected and published in 1969 as part of Chomsky's first political book, American Power and the New Mandarins.[84] He followed this with further political books, including At War with Asia (1971), The Backroom Boys (1973), For Reasons of State (1973), and Peace in the Middle East? (1975), published by Pantheon Books.[85] These publications led to Chomsky's association with the American New Left movement,[86] though he thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm and preferred the company of activists to that of intellectuals.[87] Chomsky remained largely ignored by the mainstream press throughout this period.[88] He also became involved in left-wing activism. Chomsky refused to pay half his taxes, publicly supported students who refused the draft, and was arrested while participating an antiwar teach-in outside the Pentagon.[89] During this time, Chomsky co-founded the antiwar collective RESIST with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald.[90] Although he questioned the objectives of the 1968 student protests,[91] Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups and, with his colleague Louis Kampf, ran undergraduate courses on politics at MIT independently of the conservative-dominated political science department.[92] When student activists campaigned to stop weapons and counterinsurgency research at MIT, Chomsky was sympathetic but felt that the research should remain under MIT's oversight and limited to systems of deterrence and defense.[93] In 1970 he visited southeast Asia to lecture at Vietnam's Hanoi University of Science and Technology and toured war refugee camps in Laos. In 1973 he helped lead a committee commemorating the 50th anniversary of the War Resisters League.[94] Because of his antiwar activism, Chomsky was arrested on multiple occasions and included on President Richard Nixon's master list of political opponents.[95] Chomsky was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience and his wife began studying for her own doctorate in linguistics to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or joblessness.[96] Chomsky's scientific reputation insulated him from administrative action based on his beliefs.[97] His work in linguistics continued to gain international recognition as he received multiple honorary doctorates.[98] He delivered public lectures at the University of Cambridge, Columbia University (Woodbridge Lectures), and Stanford University.[99] His appearance in a 1971 debate with French continental philosopher Michel Foucault positioned Chomsky as a symbolic figurehead of analytic philosophy.[100] He continued to publish extensively on linguistics, producing Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar (1972),[97] an enlarged edition of Language and Mind (1972),[101] and Reflections on Language (1975).[101] In 1974 Chomsky became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.[99] In the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's linguistic publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory.[102] His political talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized the Israeli government and military.[103] In the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with Edward S. Herman, who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam.[104] Together they wrote Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact & Propaganda, a book that criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and the mainstream media's failure to cover it. Warner Modular published it in 1973, but its parent company disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies destroyed.[105] While mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from Michael Albert's South End Press, an activist-oriented publishing company.[106] In 1979, South End published Chomsky and Herman's revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence as the two-volume The Political Economy of Human Rights,[107] which compares U.S. media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. It argues that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on events in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy.[108] Chomsky's response included two testimonials before the United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization, successful encouragement for American media to cover the occupation, and meetings with refugees in Lisbon.[109] The Marxist academic Steven Lukes publicly accused Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot.[110] The controversy damaged Chomsky's reputation,[111] and he maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies to defame him.[112] Chomsky had long publicly criticized Nazism, and totalitarianism more generally, but his commitment to freedom of speech led him to defend the right of French historian Robert Faurisson to advocate a position widely characterized as Holocaust denial. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for Faurisson's freedom of speech was published as the preface to the latter's 1980 book M\u00e9moire en d\u00e9fense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire.[113] Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson,[114] and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations.[115] Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist Werner Cohn later published an analysis of the affair titled Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers.[116] The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career,[117] especially in France.[118] In 1985, during the Nicaraguan Contra War\u2014in which the U.S. supported the contra militia against the Sandinista government\u2014Chomsky traveled to Managua to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics.[119] Many of these lectures were published in 1987 as On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures.[120] In 1983 he published The Fateful Triangle, which argued that the U.S. had continually used the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict for its own ends.[121] In 1988, Chomsky visited the Palestinian territories to witness the impact of Israeli occupation.[122] In 1988, Chomsky and Herman published Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, in which they outlined their propaganda model for understanding mainstream media. They argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news is censored through five filters that have great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented.[123] The book was inspired by Alex Carey and adapted into a 1992 film.[124] In 1989, Chomsky published Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies, in which he suggests that democratic citizens, to make a worthwhile democracy, undertake intellectual self-defense against the media and elite intellectual culture that seeks to control them.[125] By the 1980s, Chomsky's students had become prominent linguists who, in turn, expanded and revised his linguistic theories.[126] In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before.[127] Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance.[128] The lectures he gave on the subject were published as Powers and Prospects in 1996.[128] As a result of the international publicity Chomsky generated, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger.[129] After East Timor attained independence from Indonesia in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty.[130] After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed; Seven Stories Press collated and published these interviews that October.[131] Chomsky argued that the ensuing War on Terror was not a new development but a continuation of U.S. foreign policy and concomitant rhetoric since at least the Reagan era.[132] He gave the D.T. Lakdawala Memorial Lecture in New Delhi in 2001,[133] and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the Latin American Association of Social Scientists.[134] Chomsky's 2003 Hegemony or Survival articulated what he called the United States' \"imperial grand strategy\" and critiqued the Iraq War and other aspects of the War on Terror.[135] Chomsky toured internationally with greater regularity during this period.[134] Chomsky retired from MIT in 2002,[136] but continued to conduct research and seminars on campus as an emeritus.[137] That same year he visited Turkey to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a co-defendant and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the charge on the first day.[138] During that trip Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favor of the Kurds' human rights.[138] A supporter of the World Social Forum, he attended its conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.[139] Chomsky supported the Occupy movement, delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence: Occupy (2012), a pamphlet, and Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity (2013). He attributed Occupy's growth to a perception that the Democratic Party had abandoned the interests of the white working class.[140] In March 2014, Chomsky joined the advisory council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation,[141] an organization that advocates the global abolition of nuclear weapons, as a senior fellow.[142] The 2016 documentary Requiem for the American Dream summarizes his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a \"75-minute teach-in\".[143] In 2017, Chomsky taught a short-term politics course at the University of Arizona in Tucson[144] and was later hired as a part-time professor in the linguistics department there, with his duties including teaching and public seminars.[145] His salary is covered by philanthropic donations.[146] Chomsky signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins in 2018.[147][148] Edward Marcotte on the significance of Chomsky's linguistic theory[149] The basis of Chomsky's linguistic theory lies in biolinguistics, the linguistic school that holds that the principles underpinning the structure of language are biologically preset in the human mind and hence genetically inherited.[150] As such he argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences.[151] In adopting this position Chomsky rejects the radical behaviorist psychology of B.\u00a0F. Skinner, who viewed behavior (including talking and thinking) as a completely learned product of the interactions between organisms and their environments. Accordingly, Chomsky argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and distinguished from modes of communication used by any other animal species.[152][153] Chomsky's nativist, internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of \"rationalism\" and contrasts with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language consistent with the philosophical school of \"empiricism\",[154] which contends that all knowledge, including language, comes from external stimuli.[149] Since the 1960s Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain language-specific features of their native languages. He bases his argument on observations about human language acquisition and describes a \"poverty of the stimulus\": an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic competence they attain. For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language.[155] To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the language acquisition device, and suggested that one of linguists' tasks should be to determine what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that result from these constraints would constitute \"universal grammar\".[156][157][158] Multiple scholars have challenged universal grammar on the grounds of the evolutionary infeasibility of its genetic basis for language,[159] the lack of universal characteristics between languages,[160] and the unproven link between innate/universal structures and the structures of specific languages.[161] Transformational-generative grammar is a broad theory used to model, encode, and deduce a native speaker's linguistic capabilities.[162] These models, or \"formal grammars\", show the abstract structures of a specific language as they may relate to structures in other languages.[163] Chomsky developed transformational grammar in the mid-1950s, whereupon it became the dominant syntactic theory in linguistics for two decades.[162] \"Transformations\" refers to syntactic relationships within language, e.g., being able to infer that the subject between two sentences is the same person.[164] Chomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures: Outward-facing surface structures relate phonetic rules into sound, while inward-facing deep structures relate words and conceptual meaning. Transformational-generative grammar uses mathematical notation to express the rules that govern the connection between meaning and sound (deep and surface structures, respectively). By this theory, linguistic principles can mathematically generate potential sentences structures in a language.[149] Scholar Michael Tomasello has challenged Chomsky's theory as based in logic and not empiricism.[165] Based on this rule-based notation of grammars, Chomsky grouped natural languages into a series of four nested subsets and increasingly complex types, together known as the Chomsky hierarchy. This classification was and remains foundational to formal language theory,[166] and relevant to theoretical computer science, especially programming language theory,[167] compiler construction, and automata theory.[168] Following transformational grammar's heyday through the mid-1970s, a derivative[162] government and binding theory became a dominant research framework through the early 1990s (and remains an influential theory[162]) when linguists turned to a \"minimalist\" approach to grammar. This research focused on the principles and parameters framework, which explained children's ability to learn any language by filling open parameters (a set of universal grammar principles) that adapt as the child encounters linguistic data.[169] The minimalist program, initiated by Chomsky,[170] asks which minimal principles and parameters theory fits most elegantly, naturally, and simply.[169] In an attempt to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties, Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as \"deep structure\" and \"surface structure\" and instead emphasizes the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, with which come an infinite number of concepts, or \"logical forms\".[153] When exposed to linguistic data, a hearer-speaker's brain proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way language works. Thus while much of Chomsky's prior research focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms the brain uses to generate these rules and regulate speech.[153][171] James McGilvray, 2014[172] Chomsky is a prominent political dissident.[e] His political views have changed little since his childhood,[173] when he was influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working-class tradition.[174] He usually identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist.[175] He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet human needs: liberty, community, and freedom of association.[176] Unlike some other socialists, such as Marxists, Chomsky believes that politics lies outside the remit of science,[177] but he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories.[178] In Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed by an elite corporatocracy, which uses corporate media, advertising, and think tanks to promote its own propaganda. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth they obscure.[179] Chomsky believes this web of falsehood can be broken by \"common sense\", critical thinking, and understanding the roles of self-interest and self-deception,[180] and that intellectuals abdicate their moral responsibility to tell the truth about the world in fear of losing prestige and funding.[181] He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his social privilege, resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.[182] Although he has joined protest marches and organized activist groups, Chomsky's primary political outlets are education and publication. He offers a wide range of political writings[183] as well as free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness.[184] He is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World international union.[185] Chomsky has been a prominent critic of American imperialism;[186] he believes that the basic principle of the foreign policy of the United States is the establishment of \"open societies\" that are economically and politically controlled by the United States and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.[187] He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.[181] When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.[188] He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading Christianity; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.[189] Prominent examples he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.[189] Chomsky's political work has centered heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States.[188] He has said he focuses on the U.S. because the country has militarily and economically dominated the world during his lifetime and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows the citizenry to influence government policy.[190] His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the impact U.S. foreign policies have on the populations affected by them, he can sway the populations of the U.S. and other countries into opposing the policies.[189] He urges people to criticize their governments' motivations, decisions, and actions, to accept responsibility for their own thoughts and actions, and to apply the same standards to others as to themselves.[191] Chomsky has been critical of U.S. involvement in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.[181] Chomsky also criticizes the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, highlighting that Saudi Arabia has \"one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world\".[192] In his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of capitalism and the pursuit of material wealth.[193] At the same time, he developed a disdain for authoritarian socialism, as represented by the Marxist\u2013Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.[194] Rather than accepting the common view among U.S. economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy and total private ownership, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy and total autocratic control (whether state or private).[195] He argues that Western capitalist countries are not really democratic,[196] because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.[197] He has stated his opposition to ruling elites, among them institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and GATT.[198] Chomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the Bretton Woods financial control agreement.[199] He characterizes the U.S. as a de facto one-party state, viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic Party as manifestations of a single \"Business Party\" controlled by corporate and financial interests.[200] Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.[201] Noting the entrenchment of such an economic system, Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably.[201] Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions.[199] He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.[201] Chomsky sees libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas as the descendants of the classical liberal ideas of the Age of Enlightenment,[202] arguing that his ideological position revolves around \"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being\".[203] He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of the means of production and government by workers' councils, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.[204] The point of this self-governance is to make each citizen, in Thomas Jefferson's words, \"a direct participator in the government of affairs.\"[205] He believes that there will be no need for political parties.[206] By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose.[207] He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.[208] Chomsky criticizing Israel, 2012[209] Chomsky has written prolifically on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aiming to raise public awareness of it.[210] He has long endorsed a left binationalist program in Israel and Palestine, seeking to create a democratic state in the Levant that is home to both Jews and Arabs.[211] Nevertheless, given the realpolitik of the situation, he has also considered a two-state solution on the condition that the nation-states exist on equal terms.[212] Chomsky was denied entry to the West Bank in 2010 because of his criticisms of Israel. He had been invited to deliver a lecture at Bir Zeit University and was to meet with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.[213][214][215][216] An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman later said that Chomsky was denied entry by mistake.[217] Chomsky's political writings have largely focused on ideology, social and political power, the media, and state policy.[218] One of his best-known works, Manufacturing Consent, dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, by government-guided \"free market\" forces, is subtler and harder to undermine than was the equivalent propaganda system in the Soviet Union.[219] As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate-owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.[220] Acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the mass media's choices of topics and issues, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology:[221] although mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.[222] As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.[223] He also points to examples of important news stories that the U.S. mainstream media has ignored because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the country, including the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres in Nicaragua perpetrated by U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths without equivalent coverage of the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in that conflict.[224] To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.[225] Chomsky considers most conspiracy theories fruitless, distracting substitutes for thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.[226] While not dismissing them outright, he considers them unproductive to challenging power in a substantial way. In response to the labeling of his own ideas as a conspiracy theory, Chomsky has said that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether General Motors would be accused of conspiracy if it deliberately selected what it used or discarded to sell its product.[227] Chomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields, including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.[228] In these fields he is credited with ushering in the \"cognitive revolution\",[228] a significant paradigm shift that rejected logical positivism, the prevailing philosophical methodology of the time, and reframed how philosophers think about language and the mind.[170] Chomsky views the cognitive revolution as rooted in 17th-century rationalist ideals.[229] His position\u2014the idea that the mind contains inherent structures to understand language, perception, and thought\u2014has more in common with rationalism (Enlightenment and Cartesian) than behaviorism.[230] He named one of his key works Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966).[229] In philosophy of language, Chomsky is particularly known for his criticisms of the notion of reference and meaning in human language and his perspective on the nature and function of mental representations.[231] Chomsky's famous 1971 debate on human nature with the French philosopher Michel Foucault was symbolic in positioning Chomsky as the prototypical analytic philosopher against Foucault, a stalwart of the continental tradition.[100] It showed what appeared to be irreconcilable differences between two moral and intellectual luminaries of the 20th century. Foucault's position was that of critique, that human nature could not be conceived in terms foreign to present understanding, while Chomsky held that human nature contained universalities such as a common standard of moral justice as deduced through reason based on what rationally serves human necessity.[232] Chomsky criticized postmodernism and French philosophy generally, arguing that the obscure language of postmodern, leftist philosophers gives little aid to the working classes.[233] He has also debated analytic philosophers, including Tyler Burge, Donald Davidson, Michael Dummett, Saul Kripke, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Willard Van Orman Quine, and John Searle.[170] Chomsky's contributions span intellectual and world history, including history of philosophy.[234] Irony is a recurring characteristic of his writing, as he often implies that his readers know better, which can make them more engaged in the veracity of his claims.[235] Chomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another,[236] calling himself \"scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom\".[237] An intensely private person,[238] he is uninterested in appearances and the fame his work has brought him.[239] He also has little interest in modern art and music.[240] McGilvray suggests that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so.[241] Chomsky acknowledges that his income affords him a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population;[242] nevertheless, he characterizes himself as a \"worker\", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.[243] He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the US, he subscribes to The Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Christian Science Monitor.[244] Chomsky is non-religious, but has expressed approval of forms of religion such as liberation theology.[245] Chomsky has attracted controversy for calling established political and academic figures \"corrupt\", \"fascist\", and \"fraudulent\".[246] His colleague Steven Pinker has said that he \"portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric\", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions he receives from critics.[247] Chomsky avoids attending academic conferences, including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.[248] His approach to academic freedom has led him to support MIT academics whose actions he deplores; in 1969, when Chomsky heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was denied a position at MIT. In 1989, when Pentagon adviser John Deutch applied to be president of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, \"He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met. ... If somebody's got to be running the CIA, I'm glad it's him.\"[249] Chomsky was married to Carol (n\u00e9e\u00a0Carol Doris Schatz) from 1949 until her death in 2008.[243] They had three children together: Aviva (b. 1957), Diane (b. 1960), and Harry (b. 1967).[250] In 2014, Chomsky married Valeria Wasserman.[251] Sperlich, 2006[252] Chomsky has been a defining Western intellectual figure, central to the field of linguistics and definitive in cognitive science, computer science, philosophy, and psychology.[253] In addition to being known as one of the most important intellectuals of his time,[f] Chomsky carries a dual legacy as both a \"leader in the field\" of linguistics and \"a figure of enlightenment and inspiration\" for political dissenters.[254] Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in his being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being \"on the outer margin of acceptability\".[255] The reception of his work is intertwined with his public image as an anarchist, a gadfly, an historian, a Jew, a linguist, and a philosopher.[9] McGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the \"cognitive revolution\" in linguistics,[256] and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal, natural science,[257] moving it away from the procedural form of structural linguistics dominant during the mid-20th century.[258] As such, some have called Chomsky \"the father of modern linguistics\".[d] Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become \"the most dynamic and influential\" school of thought in the field.[259] By the 1970s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,[260] and a Minnesota State University Moorhead poll ranked Syntactic Structures as the single most important work in cognitive science.[261] In addition, his work in automata theory and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in computer science, and he is much cited in computational linguistics.[262][263][264] Chomsky's criticisms of behaviorism contributed substantially to the decline of behaviorist psychology;[265] in addition, he is generally regarded as one of the primary founders of the field of cognitive science.[266][228] Some arguments in evolutionary psychology are derived from his research results;[267] Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in animal language acquisition at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.[268] ACM Turing Award winner Donald Knuth credited Chomsky's work with helping him combine his interests in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science.[269] IBM computer scientist John Backus, another Turing Award winner, used some of Chomsky's concepts to help him develop FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level computer programming language.[270] The laureates of the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \u2014 Georges J. F. K\u00f6hler, C\u00e9sar Milstein, and Niels Kaj Jerne \u2014 used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system,[271] equating \"components of a generative grammar ... with various features of protein structures.\"[272] Chomsky's theory of generative grammar has also influenced work in music theory and analysis.[273][274][275] An MIT press release stated that Chomsky was cited within the Arts and Humanities Citation Index more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992.[276] Chomsky was also extensively cited in the Social Sciences Citation Index and Science Citation Index during the same time period, with the librarian who conducted the research commenting that the statistics show that \"he is very widely read across disciplines and that his work is used by researchers across disciplines ... it seems that you can't write a paper without citing Noam Chomsky.\"[253] As a result of his influence, there are dueling camps of Chomskyan and non-Chomskyan linguistics, with the disputes between the two camps often acrimonious.[277] Chomsky's status as the \"most-quoted living author\" is credited to his political writings, which vastly outnumber his writings on linguistics.[278] Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes him as \"one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people\";[238] journalist John Pilger has described him as a \"genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins\u2014activists and movements\u2014he's unfailingly supportive.\"[247] Arundhati Roy has called him \"one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time\",[279] and Edward Said thought him \"one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions\".[247] Fred Halliday has said that by the start of the 21st century Chomsky had become a \"guru\" for the world's anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.[247] The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media,[280] also exerting a significant influence on the growth of alternative media, including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.[281] Sperlich also notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.[137] University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their undergraduate syllabi.[282] Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas; he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so.[182] According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics \"do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text\".[182] Chomsky drew criticism for not calling the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnian War a \"genocide\", which he said would devalue the word,[283] and in appearing to deny Ed Vulliamy's reporting on the existence of Bosnian concentration camps. The subsequent editorial correction of his comments, viewed as a capitulation, was criticized by multiple Balkan watchers.[284] Chomsky's far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored his activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point, possibly in violation of federal law.[285] He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, but has refused uniformed police protection.[286] German newspaper Der Spiegel described Chomsky as \"the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred\",[137] while conservative commentator David Horowitz called him \"the most devious, the most dishonest and\u00a0... the most treacherous intellect in America\", whose work is infused with \"anti-American dementia\" and evidences his \"pathological hatred of his own country\".[287] Writing in Commentary magazine, the journalist Jonathan Kay described Chomsky as \"a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says\".[288] Chomsky's criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an anti-Semite.[289] Criticizing Chomsky's defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, Werner Cohn called Chomsky \"the most important patron\" of the neo-Nazi movement.[290] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which has been accused of monitoring Chomsky's activities,[291] called him a Holocaust denier,[292] describing him as a \"dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims\".[292] In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by \"Stalinist types\" who oppose democracy in Israel.[289] The lawyer Alan Dershowitz has called Chomsky a \"false prophet of the left\";[293] Chomsky called Dershowitz \"a complete liar\" who is on \"a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation\".[294] In early 2016 President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an open letter condemning Erdo\u011fan for his anti-Kurdish repression and double standards on terrorism.[295] Chomsky accused Erdo\u011fan of hypocrisy, noting that Erdo\u011fan supports al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate,[296] the al-Nusra Front.[295] In 1970, the London Times named Chomsky one of the \"makers of the twentieth century\".[149] He was voted the world's leading public intellectual in The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll jointly conducted by American magazine Foreign Policy and British magazine Prospect.[297] New Statesman readers listed Chomsky among the world's foremost heroes in 2006.[298] In the United States he is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Linguistic Society of America, the American Philosophical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[299] Abroad he is a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, an honorary member of the British Psychological Society, a member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina,[299] and a foreign member of the Department of Social Sciences of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.[300] He received a 1971 Guggenheim Fellowship, the 1984 American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology, the 1988 Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences, the 1996 Helmholtz Medal,[299] the 1999 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science,[301] the 2010 Erich Fromm Prize,[302] and the British Academy's 2014 Neil and Saras Smith Medal for Linguistics.[303] He is also a two-time winner of the NCTE George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language (1987 and 1989).[299] He has also received the Rabindranath Tagore Centenary Award from The Asiatic Society.[304] Chomsky received the 2004 Carl-von-Ossietzky Prize from the city of Oldenburg, Germany, to acknowledge his body of work as a political analyst and media critic.[305] He received an honorary fellowship in 2005 from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin.[306] He received the 2008 President's Medal from the Literary and Debating Society of the National University of Ireland, Galway.[307] Since 2009, he has been an honorary member of International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters (IAPTI).[308] He received the University of Wisconsin's A.E. Havens Center's Award for Lifetime Contribution to Critical Scholarship[309] and was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems' AI's Hall of Fame for \"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems.\"[310] Chomsky has an Erd\u0151s number of four.[311] In 2011, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded Chomsky the US Peace Prize for antiwar activities over five decades.[312] For his work in human rights, peace, and social criticism, he received the 2011 Sydney Peace Prize,[313] the 2017 Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize[314] and the Dorothy Eldridge Peacemaker Award.[301] Chomsky has received honorary doctorates from institutions including the University of London and the University of Chicago (1967), Loyola University Chicago and Swarthmore College (1970), Bard College (1971), Delhi University (1972), and the University of Massachusetts (1973) among others.[98] His public lectures have included the 1969 John Locke Lectures,[301] 1975 Whidden Lectures,[99] 1977 Huizinga Lecture, and 1988 Massey Lectures, among others.[301] Various tributes to Chomsky have been dedicated over the years. He is the eponym for a bee species,[315] a frog species,[316] and a building complex at the Indian university Jamia Millia Islamia.[317] Actor Viggo Mortensen and avant-garde guitarist Buckethead dedicated their 2003 album Pandemoniumfromamerica to Chomsky.[318] Linguistics Politics",

Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\",[d] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Laureate Professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.\nBorn to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.\nAn outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\". Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of freedom of speech, including Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.\nOne of the most cited scholars alive,[20] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proven highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism.\nAvram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[21] His parents, Ze'ev \"William\" Chomsky and Elsie Simonofsky, were Jewish immigrants.[22] William had fled the Russian Empire in 1913 to escape conscription and worked in Baltimore sweatshops and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university.[23] After moving to Philadelphia, William became principal of the Congregation Mikveh Israel religious school and joined the Gratz College faculty. He placed great emphasis on educating people so that they would be \"well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all\", a mission that shaped and was subsequently adopted by his son.[24] Elsie was a teacher and activist born in Belarus. They met at Mikveh Israel, where they both worked.[22]\nNoam was the Chomskys' first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later, in 1934.[25][26] The brothers were close, though David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive.[27] Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of Zionism; the family was particularly influenced by the Left Zionist writings of Ahad Ha'am.[26] Chomsky faced antisemitism as a child, particularly from Philadelphia's Irish and German communities.[28]\nChomsky attended the independent, Deweyite Oak Lane Country Day School[29] and Philadelphia's Central High School, where he excelled academically and joined various clubs and societies, but was troubled by the school's hierarchical and regimented teaching methods.[30] He also attended Hebrew High School at Gratz College, where his father taught.[31]\nChomsky has described his parents as \"normal Roosevelt Democrats\" with center-left politics, but other relatives involved in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union exposed him to socialism and far-left politics.[32] He was substantially influenced by his uncle and the Jewish leftists who frequented his New York City newspaper stand to debate current affairs.[33] Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores when visiting his uncle in the city, voraciously reading political literature.[34] He wrote his first article at age 10 on the spread of fascism following the fall of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War[35] and, from the age of 12 or 13, identified with anarchist politics.[31] He later described his discovery of anarchism as \"a lucky accident\"[36] that made him critical of Stalinism and other forms of Marxism\u2013Leninism.[37]\nIn 1945, aged 16, Chomsky began a general program of study at the University of Pennsylvania, where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning Arabic.[38] Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.[39] Frustrated with his experiences at the university, he considered dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine,[40] but his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.[41] Chomsky's BA honors thesis, \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\", applied Harris's methods to the language.[42] Chomsky revised this thesis for his MA, which he received from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951; it was subsequently published as a book.[43] He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of Nelson Goodman.[44]\nFrom 1951 to 1955 Chomsky was a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where he undertook research on what became his doctoral dissertation.[45] Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,[46] Chomsky was attracted to Harvard in part because the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, J. L. Austin of the University of Oxford, strongly influenced Chomsky.[47] In 1952 Chomsky published his first academic article, Systems of Syntactic Analysis, which appeared not in a journal of linguistics but in The Journal of Symbolic Logic.[46] Highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures at the University of Chicago and Yale University.[48] He had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, but in 1955 he submitted a thesis setting out his ideas on transformational grammar; he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree for it, and it was privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in 1975 as part of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory.[49] Harvard professor George Armitage Miller was impressed by Chomsky's thesis and collaborated with him on several technical papers in mathematical linguistics.[50] Chomsky's doctorate exempted him from compulsory military service, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.[51]\nIn 1947 Chomsky began a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz, whom he had known since early childhood. They married in 1949.[52] After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to the Allston area of Boston and remained there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of Lexington.[53] In 1953 the couple took a Harvard travel grant to Europe, from the United Kingdom through France, Switzerland into Italy,[54] and Israel, where they lived in Hashomer Hatzair's HaZore'a kibbutz. Despite enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the country's Jewish nationalism, anti-Arab racism and, within the kibbutz's leftist community, pro-Stalinism.[55]\nOn visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of the Yiddish anarchist journal Fraye Arbeter Shtime and became enamored with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker, a contributor whose work introduced Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism.[56] Chomsky also read other political thinkers: the anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n, democratic socialists George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, and Dwight Macdonald, and works by Marxists Karl Liebknecht, Karl Korsch, and Rosa Luxemburg.[57] His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the Spanish Civil War, as documented in Orwell's Homage to Catalonia (1938).[58] He read the leftist journal Politics, which furthered his interest in anarchism,[59] and the council communist periodical Living Marxism, though he rejected the orthodoxy of its editor, Paul Mattick.[60] He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the Leninist League of the United States, an anti-Stalinist Marxist\u2013Leninist group, sharing their view that the Second World War was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's \"state capitalists\" to crush Europe's proletariat.[61]\nChomsky befriended two linguists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson, the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position there in 1955. At MIT, Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project and half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy.[62] He described MIT as \"a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work.\"[63] In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor.[64] The Chomskys had their first child that same year, a daughter named Aviva.[65] He also published his first book on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris\u2013Bloomfield trend in the field.[66] Responses to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused \"significant upheaval\" in the discipline.[67] The linguist John Lyons later asserted that Syntactic Structures \"revolutionized the scientific study of language\".[68] From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[69]\nIn 1959 Chomsky published a review of B. F. Skinner's 1957 book Verbal Behavior in the academic journal Language, in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior.[70][71] The review argued that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics and helped to establish Chomsky as an intellectual.[72] With Halle, Chomsky proceeded to found MIT's graduate program in linguistics. In 1961 he was awarded tenure, becoming a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.[73] Chomsky went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists, held in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which established him as the de facto spokesperson of American linguistics.[74] Between 1963 and 1965 he consulted on a military-sponsored project \"to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control\"; Barbara Partee, a collaborator on this project and then-student of Chomsky, has said this research was justified to the military on the basis that \"in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program.\"[75]\nChomsky continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar (1966), and Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966).[76] Along with Halle, he also edited the Studies in Language series of books for Harper and Row.[77] As he began to accrue significant academic recognition and honors for his work, Chomsky lectured at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966.[78] His Beckman lectures at Berkeley were assembled and published as Language and Mind in 1968.[79] Despite his growing stature, an intellectual falling-out between Chomsky and some of his early colleagues and doctoral students\u2014including Paul Postal, John \"Haj\" Ross, George Lakoff, and James D. McCawley\u2014triggered a series of academic debates that came to be known as the \"Linguistics Wars\", although they revolved largely around philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.[80]\nChomsky on the Vietnam War[81]\nChomsky joined protests against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes.[82] His 1967 critique of U.S. involvement, \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\", among other contributions to The New York Review of Books, debuted Chomsky as a public dissident.[83] This essay and other political articles were collected and published in 1969 as part of Chomsky's first political book, American Power and the New Mandarins.[84] He followed this with further political books, including At War with Asia (1971), The Backroom Boys (1973), For Reasons of State (1973), and Peace in the Middle East? (1975), published by Pantheon Books.[85] These publications led to Chomsky's association with the American New Left movement,[86] though he thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm and preferred the company of activists to that of intellectuals.[87] Chomsky remained largely ignored by the mainstream press throughout this period.[88]\nHe also became involved in left-wing activism. Chomsky refused to pay half his taxes, publicly supported students who refused the draft, and was arrested while participating an antiwar teach-in outside the Pentagon.[89] During this time, Chomsky co-founded the antiwar collective RESIST with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald.[90] Although he questioned the objectives of the 1968 student protests,[91] Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups and, with his colleague Louis Kampf, ran undergraduate courses on politics at MIT independently of the conservative-dominated political science department.[92] When student activists campaigned to stop weapons and counterinsurgency research at MIT, Chomsky was sympathetic but felt that the research should remain under MIT's oversight and limited to systems of deterrence and defense.[93] In 1970 he visited southeast Asia to lecture at Vietnam's Hanoi University of Science and Technology and toured war refugee camps in Laos. In 1973 he helped lead a committee commemorating the 50th anniversary of the War Resisters League.[94]\nBecause of his antiwar activism, Chomsky was arrested on multiple occasions and included on President Richard Nixon's master list of political opponents.[95] Chomsky was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience and his wife began studying for her own doctorate in linguistics to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or joblessness.[96] Chomsky's scientific reputation insulated him from administrative action based on his beliefs.[97]\nHis work in linguistics continued to gain international recognition as he received multiple honorary doctorates.[98] He delivered public lectures at the University of Cambridge, Columbia University (Woodbridge Lectures), and Stanford University.[99] His appearance in a 1971 debate with French continental philosopher Michel Foucault positioned Chomsky as a symbolic figurehead of analytic philosophy.[100] He continued to publish extensively on linguistics, producing Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar (1972),[97] an enlarged edition of Language and Mind (1972),[101] and Reflections on Language (1975).[101] In 1974 Chomsky became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.[99]\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's linguistic publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory.[102] His political talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized the Israeli government and military.[103] In the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with Edward S. Herman, who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam.[104] Together they wrote Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact &amp; Propaganda, a book that criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and the mainstream media's failure to cover it. Warner Modular published it in 1973, but its parent company disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies destroyed.[105]\nWhile mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from Michael Albert's South End Press, an activist-oriented publishing company.[106] In 1979, South End published Chomsky and Herman's revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence as the two-volume The Political Economy of Human Rights,[107] which compares U.S. media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. It argues that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on events in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy.[108] Chomsky's response included two testimonials before the United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization, successful encouragement for American media to cover the occupation, and meetings with refugees in Lisbon.[109] The Marxist academic Steven Lukes publicly accused Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot.[110] The controversy damaged Chomsky's reputation,[111] and he maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies to defame him.[112]\nChomsky had long publicly criticized Nazism, and totalitarianism more generally, but his commitment to freedom of speech led him to defend the right of French historian Robert Faurisson to advocate a position widely characterized as Holocaust denial. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for Faurisson's freedom of speech was published as the preface to the latter's 1980 book M\u00e9moire en d\u00e9fense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire.[113] Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson,[114] and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations.[115] Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist Werner Cohn later published an analysis of the affair titled Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers.[116] The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career,[117] especially in France.[118]\nIn 1985, during the Nicaraguan Contra War\u2014in which the U.S. supported the contra militia against the Sandinista government\u2014Chomsky traveled to Managua to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics.[119] Many of these lectures were published in 1987 as On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures.[120] In 1983 he published The Fateful Triangle, which argued that the U.S. had continually used the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict for its own ends.[121] In 1988, Chomsky visited the Palestinian territories to witness the impact of Israeli occupation.[122]\nIn 1988, Chomsky and Herman published Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, in which they outlined their propaganda model for understanding mainstream media. They argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news is censored through five filters that have great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented.[123] The book was inspired by Alex Carey and adapted into a 1992 film.[124] In 1989, Chomsky published Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies, in which he suggests that democratic citizens, to make a worthwhile democracy, undertake intellectual self-defense against the media and elite intellectual culture that seeks to control them.[125] By the 1980s, Chomsky's students had become prominent linguists who, in turn, expanded and revised his linguistic theories.[126]\nIn the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before.[127] Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance.[128] The lectures he gave on the subject were published as Powers and Prospects in 1996.[128] As a result of the international publicity Chomsky generated, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger.[129] After East Timor attained independence from Indonesia in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty.[130]\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed; Seven Stories Press collated and published these interviews that October.[131] Chomsky argued that the ensuing War on Terror was not a new development but a continuation of U.S. foreign policy and concomitant rhetoric since at least the Reagan era.[132] He gave the D.T. Lakdawala Memorial Lecture in New Delhi in 2001,[133] and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the Latin American Association of Social Scientists.[134] Chomsky's 2003 Hegemony or Survival articulated what he called the United States' \"imperial grand strategy\" and critiqued the Iraq War and other aspects of the War on Terror.[135] Chomsky toured internationally with greater regularity during this period.[134]\nChomsky retired from MIT in 2002,[136] but continued to conduct research and seminars on campus as an emeritus.[137] That same year he visited Turkey to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a co-defendant and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the charge on the first day.[138] During that trip Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favor of the Kurds' human rights.[138] A supporter of the World Social Forum, he attended its conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.[139]\nChomsky supported the Occupy movement, delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence: Occupy (2012), a pamphlet, and Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity (2013). He attributed Occupy's growth to a perception that the Democratic Party had abandoned the interests of the white working class.[140] In March 2014, Chomsky joined the advisory council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation,[141] an organization that advocates the global abolition of nuclear weapons, as a senior fellow.[142] The 2016 documentary Requiem for the American Dream summarizes his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a \"75-minute teach-in\".[143]\nIn 2017, Chomsky taught a short-term politics course at the University of Arizona in Tucson[144] and was later hired as a part-time professor in the linguistics department there, with his duties including teaching and public seminars.[145] His salary is covered by philanthropic donations.[146]\nChomsky signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins in 2018.[147][148]\nEdward Marcotte on the significance of Chomsky's linguistic theory[149]\nThe basis of Chomsky's linguistic theory lies in biolinguistics, the linguistic school that holds that the principles underpinning the structure of language are biologically preset in the human mind and hence genetically inherited.[150] As such he argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences.[151] In adopting this position Chomsky rejects the radical behaviorist psychology of B.\u00a0F. Skinner, who viewed behavior (including talking and thinking) as a completely learned product of the interactions between organisms and their environments. Accordingly, Chomsky argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and distinguished from modes of communication used by any other animal species.[152][153] Chomsky's nativist, internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of \"rationalism\" and contrasts with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language consistent with the philosophical school of \"empiricism\",[154] which contends that all knowledge, including language, comes from external stimuli.[149]\nSince the 1960s Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain language-specific features of their native languages. He bases his argument on observations about human language acquisition and describes a \"poverty of the stimulus\": an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic competence they attain. For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language.[155] To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the language acquisition device, and suggested that one of linguists' tasks should be to determine what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that result from these constraints would constitute \"universal grammar\".[156][157][158] Multiple scholars have challenged universal grammar on the grounds of the evolutionary infeasibility of its genetic basis for language,[159] the lack of universal characteristics between languages,[160] and the unproven link between innate/universal structures and the structures of specific languages.[161]\nTransformational-generative grammar is a broad theory used to model, encode, and deduce a native speaker's linguistic capabilities.[162] These models, or \"formal grammars\", show the abstract structures of a specific language as they may relate to structures in other languages.[163] Chomsky developed transformational grammar in the mid-1950s, whereupon it became the dominant syntactic theory in linguistics for two decades.[162] \"Transformations\" refers to syntactic relationships within language, e.g., being able to infer that the subject between two sentences is the same person.[164] Chomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures: Outward-facing surface structures relate phonetic rules into sound, while inward-facing deep structures relate words and conceptual meaning. Transformational-generative grammar uses mathematical notation to express the rules that govern the connection between meaning and sound (deep and surface structures, respectively). By this theory, linguistic principles can mathematically generate potential sentences structures in a language.[149] Scholar Michael Tomasello has challenged Chomsky's theory as based in logic and not empiricism.[165]\nBased on this rule-based notation of grammars,  Chomsky grouped natural languages into a series of four nested subsets and increasingly complex types, together known as the Chomsky hierarchy. This classification was and remains foundational to formal language theory,[166] and relevant to theoretical computer science, especially programming language theory,[167] compiler construction, and automata theory.[168]\nFollowing transformational grammar's heyday through the mid-1970s, a derivative[162] government and binding theory became a dominant research framework through the early 1990s (and remains an influential theory[162]) when linguists turned to a \"minimalist\" approach to grammar. This research focused on the principles and parameters framework, which explained children's ability to learn any language by filling open parameters (a set of universal grammar principles) that adapt as the child encounters linguistic data.[169] The minimalist program, initiated by Chomsky,[170] asks which minimal principles and parameters theory fits most elegantly, naturally, and simply.[169] In an attempt to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties, Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as \"deep structure\" and \"surface structure\" and instead emphasizes the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, with which come an infinite number of concepts, or \"logical forms\".[153] When exposed to linguistic data, a hearer-speaker's brain proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way language works. Thus while much of Chomsky's prior research focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms the brain uses to generate these rules and regulate speech.[153][171]\nJames McGilvray, 2014[172]\nChomsky is a prominent political dissident.[e] His political views have changed little since his childhood,[173] when he was influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working-class tradition.[174] He usually identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist.[175] He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet human needs: liberty, community, and freedom of association.[176] Unlike some other socialists, such as Marxists, Chomsky believes that politics lies outside the remit of science,[177] but he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories.[178]\nIn Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed by an elite corporatocracy, which uses corporate media, advertising, and think tanks to promote its own propaganda. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth they obscure.[179] Chomsky believes this web of falsehood can be broken by \"common sense\", critical thinking, and understanding the roles of self-interest and self-deception,[180] and that intellectuals abdicate their moral responsibility to tell the truth about the world in fear of losing prestige and funding.[181] He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his social privilege, resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.[182]\nAlthough he has joined protest marches and organized activist groups, Chomsky's primary political outlets are education and publication. He offers a wide range of political writings[183] as well as free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness.[184] He is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World international union.[185]\nChomsky has been a prominent critic of American imperialism;[186] he believes that the basic principle of the foreign policy of the United States is the establishment of \"open societies\" that are economically and politically controlled by the United States and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.[187] He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.[181] When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.[188] He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading Christianity; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.[189] Prominent examples he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.[189]\nChomsky's political work has centered heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States.[188] He has said he focuses on the U.S. because the country has militarily and economically dominated the world during his lifetime and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows the citizenry to influence government policy.[190] His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the impact U.S. foreign policies have on the populations affected by them, he can sway the populations of the U.S. and other countries into opposing the policies.[189] He urges people to criticize their governments' motivations, decisions, and actions, to accept responsibility for their own thoughts and actions, and to apply the same standards to others as to themselves.[191]\nChomsky has been critical of U.S. involvement in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.[181] Chomsky also criticizes the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, highlighting that Saudi Arabia has \"one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world\".[192]\nIn his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of capitalism and the pursuit of material wealth.[193] At the same time, he developed a disdain for authoritarian socialism, as represented by the Marxist\u2013Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.[194] Rather than accepting the common view among U.S. economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy and total private ownership, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy and total autocratic control (whether state or private).[195] He argues that Western capitalist countries are not really democratic,[196] because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.[197] He has stated his opposition to ruling elites, among them institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and GATT.[198]\nChomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the Bretton Woods financial control agreement.[199] He characterizes the U.S. as a de facto one-party state, viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic Party as manifestations of a single \"Business Party\" controlled by corporate and financial interests.[200] Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.[201]\nNoting the entrenchment of such an economic system, Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably.[201] Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions.[199] He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.[201]\nChomsky sees libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas as the descendants of the classical liberal ideas of the Age of Enlightenment,[202] arguing that his ideological position revolves around \"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being\".[203] He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of the means of production and government by workers' councils, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.[204] The point of this self-governance is to make each citizen, in Thomas Jefferson's words, \"a direct participator in the government of affairs.\"[205] He believes that there will be no need for political parties.[206] By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose.[207] He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.[208]\nChomsky criticizing Israel, 2012[209]\nChomsky has written prolifically on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aiming to raise public awareness of it.[210] He has long endorsed a left binationalist program in Israel and Palestine, seeking to create a democratic state in the Levant that is home to both Jews and Arabs.[211] Nevertheless, given the realpolitik of the situation, he has also considered a two-state solution on the condition that the nation-states exist on equal terms.[212] Chomsky was denied entry to the West Bank in 2010 because of his criticisms of Israel. He had been invited to deliver a lecture at Bir Zeit University and was to meet with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.[213][214][215][216] An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman later said that Chomsky was denied entry by mistake.[217]\nChomsky's political writings have largely focused on ideology, social and political power, the media, and state policy.[218] One of his best-known works, Manufacturing Consent, dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, by government-guided \"free market\" forces, is subtler and harder to undermine than was the equivalent propaganda system in the Soviet Union.[219] As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate-owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.[220] Acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the mass media's choices of topics and issues, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology:[221] although mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.[222] As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.[223] He also points to examples of important news stories that the U.S. mainstream media has ignored because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the country, including the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres in Nicaragua perpetrated by U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths without equivalent coverage of the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in that conflict.[224] To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.[225]\nChomsky considers most conspiracy theories fruitless, distracting substitutes for thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.[226] While not dismissing them outright, he considers them unproductive to challenging power in a substantial way. In response to the labeling of his own ideas as a conspiracy theory, Chomsky has said that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether General Motors would be accused of conspiracy if it deliberately selected what it used or discarded to sell its product.[227]\nChomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields, including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.[228] In these fields he is credited with ushering in the \"cognitive revolution\",[228] a significant paradigm shift that rejected logical positivism, the prevailing philosophical methodology of the time, and reframed how philosophers think about language and the mind.[170] Chomsky views the cognitive revolution as rooted in 17th-century rationalist ideals.[229] His position\u2014the idea that the mind contains inherent structures to understand language, perception, and thought\u2014has more in common with rationalism (Enlightenment and Cartesian) than behaviorism.[230] He named one of his key works Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966).[229] In philosophy of language, Chomsky is particularly known for his criticisms of the notion of reference and meaning in human language and his perspective on the nature and function of mental representations.[231]\nChomsky's famous 1971 debate on human nature with the French philosopher Michel Foucault was symbolic in positioning Chomsky as the prototypical analytic philosopher against Foucault, a stalwart of the continental tradition.[100] It showed what appeared to be irreconcilable differences between two moral and intellectual luminaries of the 20th century. Foucault's position was that of critique, that human nature could not be conceived in terms foreign to present understanding, while Chomsky held that human nature contained universalities such as a common standard of moral justice as deduced through reason based on what rationally serves human necessity.[232] Chomsky criticized postmodernism and French philosophy generally, arguing that the obscure language of postmodern, leftist philosophers gives little aid to the working classes.[233] He has also debated analytic philosophers, including Tyler Burge, Donald Davidson, Michael Dummett, Saul Kripke, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Willard Van Orman Quine, and John Searle.[170]\nChomsky's contributions span intellectual and world history, including history of philosophy.[234] Irony is a recurring characteristic of his writing, as he often implies that his readers know better, which can make them more engaged in the veracity of his claims.[235]\nChomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another,[236] calling himself \"scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom\".[237] An intensely private person,[238] he is uninterested in appearances and the fame his work has brought him.[239] He also has little interest in modern art and music.[240] McGilvray suggests that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so.[241] Chomsky acknowledges that his income affords him a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population;[242] nevertheless, he characterizes himself as a \"worker\", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.[243] He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the US, he subscribes to The Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Christian Science Monitor.[244] Chomsky is non-religious, but has expressed approval of forms of religion such as liberation theology.[245]\nChomsky has attracted controversy for calling established political and academic figures \"corrupt\", \"fascist\", and \"fraudulent\".[246] His colleague Steven Pinker has said that he \"portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric\", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions he receives from critics.[247] Chomsky avoids attending academic conferences, including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.[248] His approach to academic freedom has led him to support MIT academics whose actions he deplores; in 1969, when Chomsky heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was denied a position at MIT. In 1989, when Pentagon adviser John Deutch applied to be president of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, \"He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met. ... If somebody's got to be running the CIA, I'm glad it's him.\"[249]\nChomsky was married to Carol (n\u00e9e\u00a0Carol Doris Schatz) from 1949 until her death in 2008.[243] They had three children together: Aviva (b. 1957), Diane (b. 1960), and Harry (b. 1967).[250] In 2014, Chomsky married Valeria Wasserman.[251]\nSperlich, 2006[252]\nChomsky has been a defining Western intellectual figure, central to the field of linguistics and definitive in cognitive science, computer science, philosophy, and psychology.[253] In addition to being known as one of the most important intellectuals of his time,[f] Chomsky carries a dual legacy as both a \"leader in the field\" of linguistics and \"a figure of enlightenment and inspiration\" for political dissenters.[254] Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in his being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being \"on the outer margin of acceptability\".[255] The reception of his work is intertwined with his public image as an anarchist, a gadfly, an historian, a Jew, a linguist, and a philosopher.[9]\nMcGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the \"cognitive revolution\" in linguistics,[256] and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal, natural science,[257] moving it away from the procedural form of structural linguistics dominant during the mid-20th century.[258] As such, some have called Chomsky \"the father of modern linguistics\".[d] Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become \"the most dynamic and influential\" school of thought in the field.[259] By the 1970s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,[260] and a Minnesota State University Moorhead poll ranked Syntactic Structures as the single most important work in cognitive science.[261] In addition, his work in automata theory and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in computer science, and he is much cited in computational linguistics.[262][263][264]\nChomsky's criticisms of behaviorism contributed substantially to the decline of behaviorist psychology;[265] in addition, he is generally regarded as one of the primary founders of the field of cognitive science.[266][228] Some arguments in evolutionary psychology are derived from his research results;[267] Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in animal language acquisition at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.[268]\nACM Turing Award winner Donald Knuth credited Chomsky's work with helping him combine his interests in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science.[269] IBM computer scientist John Backus, another Turing Award winner, used some of Chomsky's concepts to help him develop FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level computer programming language.[270] The laureates of the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \u2014 Georges J. F. K\u00f6hler, C\u00e9sar Milstein, and Niels Kaj Jerne \u2014 used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system,[271] equating \"components of a generative grammar ... with various features of protein structures.\"[272] Chomsky's theory of generative grammar has also influenced work in music theory and analysis.[273][274][275]\nAn MIT press release stated that Chomsky was cited within the Arts and Humanities Citation Index more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992.[276] Chomsky was also extensively cited in the Social Sciences Citation Index and Science Citation Index during the same time period, with the librarian who conducted the research commenting that the statistics show that \"he is very widely read across disciplines and that his work is used by researchers across disciplines ... it seems that you can't write a paper without citing Noam Chomsky.\"[253] As a result of his influence, there are dueling camps of Chomskyan and non-Chomskyan linguistics, with the disputes between the two camps often acrimonious.[277]\nChomsky's status as the \"most-quoted living author\" is credited to his political writings, which vastly outnumber his writings on linguistics.[278] Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes him as \"one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people\";[238] journalist John Pilger has described him as a \"genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins\u2014activists and movements\u2014he's unfailingly supportive.\"[247] Arundhati Roy has called him \"one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time\",[279] and Edward Said thought him \"one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions\".[247] Fred Halliday has said that by the start of the 21st century Chomsky had become a \"guru\" for the world's anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.[247] The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media,[280] also exerting a significant influence on the growth of alternative media, including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.[281]\nSperlich also notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.[137] University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their undergraduate syllabi.[282] Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas; he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so.[182] According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics \"do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text\".[182]\nChomsky drew criticism for not calling the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnian War a \"genocide\", which he said would devalue the word,[283] and in appearing to deny Ed Vulliamy's reporting on the existence of Bosnian concentration camps. The subsequent editorial correction of his comments, viewed as a capitulation, was criticized by multiple Balkan watchers.[284]\nChomsky's far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored his activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point, possibly in violation of federal law.[285] He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, but has refused uniformed police protection.[286] German newspaper Der Spiegel described Chomsky as \"the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred\",[137] while conservative commentator David Horowitz called him \"the most devious, the most dishonest and\u00a0... the most treacherous intellect in America\", whose work is infused with \"anti-American dementia\" and evidences his \"pathological hatred of his own country\".[287] Writing in Commentary magazine, the journalist Jonathan Kay described Chomsky as \"a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says\".[288]\nChomsky's criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an anti-Semite.[289] Criticizing Chomsky's defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, Werner Cohn called Chomsky \"the most important patron\" of the neo-Nazi movement.[290] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which has been accused of monitoring Chomsky's activities,[291] called him a Holocaust denier,[292] describing him as a \"dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims\".[292] In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by \"Stalinist types\" who oppose democracy in Israel.[289] The lawyer Alan Dershowitz has called Chomsky a \"false prophet of the left\";[293] Chomsky called Dershowitz \"a complete liar\" who is on \"a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation\".[294] In early 2016 President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an open letter condemning Erdo\u011fan for his anti-Kurdish repression and double standards on terrorism.[295] Chomsky accused Erdo\u011fan of hypocrisy, noting that Erdo\u011fan supports al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate,[296] the al-Nusra Front.[295]\nIn 1970, the London Times named Chomsky one of the \"makers of the twentieth century\".[149] He was voted the world's leading public intellectual in The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll jointly conducted by American magazine Foreign Policy and British magazine Prospect.[297] New Statesman readers listed Chomsky among the world's foremost heroes in 2006.[298]\nIn the United States he is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Linguistic Society of America, the American Philosophical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[299] Abroad he is a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, an honorary member of the British Psychological Society, a member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina,[299] and a foreign member of the Department of Social Sciences of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.[300] He received a 1971 Guggenheim Fellowship, the 1984 American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology, the 1988 Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences, the 1996 Helmholtz Medal,[299] the 1999 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science,[301] the 2010 Erich Fromm Prize,[302] and the British Academy's 2014 Neil and Saras Smith Medal for Linguistics.[303] He is also a two-time winner of the NCTE George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language (1987 and 1989).[299] He has also received the Rabindranath Tagore Centenary Award from The Asiatic Society.[304]\nChomsky received the 2004 Carl-von-Ossietzky Prize from the city of Oldenburg, Germany, to acknowledge his body of work as a political analyst and media critic.[305] He received an honorary fellowship in 2005 from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin.[306] He received the 2008 President's Medal from the Literary and Debating Society of the National University of Ireland, Galway.[307] Since 2009, he has been an honorary member of International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters (IAPTI).[308] He received the University of Wisconsin's A.E. Havens Center's Award for Lifetime Contribution to Critical Scholarship[309] and was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems' AI's Hall of Fame for \"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems.\"[310] Chomsky has an Erd\u0151s number of four.[311]\nIn 2011, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded Chomsky the US Peace Prize for antiwar activities over five decades.[312] For his work in human rights, peace, and social criticism, he received the 2011 Sydney Peace Prize,[313] the 2017 Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize[314] and the Dorothy Eldridge Peacemaker Award.[301]\nChomsky has received honorary doctorates from institutions including the University of London and the University of Chicago (1967), Loyola University Chicago and Swarthmore College (1970), Bard College (1971), Delhi University (1972), and the University of Massachusetts (1973) among others.[98] His public lectures have included the 1969 John Locke Lectures,[301] 1975 Whidden Lectures,[99] 1977 Huizinga Lecture, and 1988 Massey Lectures, among others.[301]\nVarious tributes to Chomsky have been dedicated over the years. He is the eponym for a bee species,[315] a frog species,[316] and a building complex at the Indian university Jamia Millia Islamia.[317] Actor Viggo Mortensen and avant-garde guitarist Buckethead dedicated their 2003 album Pandemoniumfromamerica to Chomsky.[318]\nLinguistics\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nNicholas Offerman (born June 26, 1970) is an American actor, writer, comedian, producer and carpenter. He is best known for his role as Ron Swanson in the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation, for which he received the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy and was twice nominated for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Offerman is also known for his role in The Founder, in which he portrays Richard McDonald, one of the brothers who developed the fast food chain McDonald's. His first major television role since the end of Parks and Recreation was as Karl Weathers in the FX series Fargo, for which he received a Critics' Choice Television Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries. Offerman was born in Joliet, Illinois and grew up in nearby Minooka.[1] He is the son of Cathy (n\u00e9e Roberts), a nurse, and Ric Offerman, who taught social studies at a junior high school in nearby Channahon.[2][3] Offerman was raised Catholic.[4][5] He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 1993.[1] That year, he and a group of fellow students co-founded the Defiant Theatre, a Chicago-based theatre company.[1] Offerman lived in Chicago in the mid-1990s, where he participated with theatre companies such as Steppenwolf, Goodman, and Wisdom Bridge. At Steppenwolf, he also worked as a fight choreographer and master carpenter.[6] During this time, Offerman became acquainted with Amy Poehler, who was heavily involved with the Chicago improv comedy scene.[1] In 2003, he married Will & Grace actress Megan Mullally. Offerman has also appeared on her talk show, The Megan Mullally Show. At the same time, he began appearing on television as a plumber on Will & Grace during its fourth season's Thanksgiving episode, on The King of Queens, in three episodes of 24, and in an episode of The West Wing. Prior to Parks and Recreation, his most prominent role was as factory worker and Benny Lopez's love interest Randy McGee on George Lopez. He appeared twice on Gilmore Girls, in 2003's \"The Festival of Living Art\" and 2005's \"Always a Godmother, Never a God\" and in the third-season episode of Monk, \"Mr. Monk and the Election\" as a helper for the campaign of Natalie Teeger. In 2007, Offerman co-starred in the Comedy Central series American Body Shop. In 2009, The Office producers Michael Schur and Greg Daniels offered Offerman a regular supporting role in their NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation: that of Ron Swanson, the deadpan, government-hating, libertarian head of a city parks department and boss of Amy Poehler's character Leslie Knope.[1] Slate magazine declared Offerman \"Parks and Recreation's secret weapon\", and said he regularly stole scenes and \"has a gift for understated physical comedy.\"[7] The role weaves antagonism and political philosophy with humanity, while the intense libertarian philosophy the character lives out is often played off against the equally intense liberalism and 'do-gooder' mentality of Poehler's character. Offerman said that supporting parts such as that of Parks and Recreation are his ideal roles, and that he draws particular inspiration from Reverend Jim Ignatowski, the character played by Christopher Lloyd in the sitcom Taxi.[1] Offerman has also been featured in the Adult Swim series Childrens Hospital with Rob Corddry and Rob Huebel. He is the voice of Axe Cop in the animated series of the same name that premiered on July 27, 2013.[8] In the same year, Offerman portrayed Johnny Cool in the \"Boston\" episode of Derek Waters' Drunk History on Comedy Central. Offerman has appeared in films, such as November (2004), Cursed (2005), Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2005), Sin City (2005), The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009) and The Kings of Summer (2013). He also appeared in the 2006 film Wristcutters: A Love Story as a cop who attempts to arrest Shannyn Sossamon's character, Mikal. 2012 saw him in two film roles, as 21 Jump Street's Deputy Chief Hardy and in Casa de Mi Padre as DEA Agent Parker. He reprised his role as Deputy Chief Hardy in 22 Jump Street two years later. Additionally, he starred in and produced an independent film, Somebody Up There Likes Me (2012), shot in Austin, Texas. He appeared in the 2013 comedy We're the Millers, which starred Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston, and voiced MetalBeard in The Lego Movie. Offerman conceived of and starred in punk band FIDLAR's 2013 video for their song \"Cocaine\".[9] Offerman also played an alcoholic college guidance counselor in Believe Me (2014). Offerman played the recurring role Karl Weathers in the second season of Fargo (2015). Offerman voiced Grandpa Mike alongside wife Megan Mullally who voiced Grandma Linda in Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015). He portrayed the first establisher of McDonald's, Dick McDonald, in The Founder (2016). Offerman also starred in alternative rock band They Might Be Giants' 2018 video for their song \"The Greatest\".[10] In addition to acting, Offerman is also a professional boat builder and has a side business as a wood craftsman. Offerman makes furniture and other wooden structures such as canoes and boats at his woodshop.[11] He also released an instructional DVD in 2008 titled Fine Woodstrip Canoe Building with Nick Offerman, shot by Jimmy DiResta. DiResta's pay for shooting the DVD was a canoe, the second Offerman has built.[12] Offerman has released three semi-autobiographical publications: the first, Paddle Your Own Canoe: One Man's Fundamentals for Delicious Living was released in 2013; his second, Gumption: Relighting the Torch of Freedom with America's Gutsiest Troublemakers, was released May 26, 2015; the third, Good Clean Fun: Misadventures in Sawdust at Offerman Woodshop, was released October 18, 2016. As of July 2019, Offerman is currently on tour visiting 37 cities across America. His All Rise Tour kicked off on July 20, 2019, in Thackerville and will continue through the rest of 2019, hitting major city: Chicago, San Francisco, Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York, Detroit and Atlanta. Back in 2017, Offerman launched his Full Bush Tour which consisted of 28 shows across the U.S. and Canada.[13] Offerman married actress Megan Mullally on September 20, 2003.[14] They met while acting in The Berlin Circle,[15] a play produced by the Evidence Room Theatre Company, and married after dating for 18 months. While they were still dating, Offerman appeared in a guest role on Mullally's sitcom, Will & Grace, in a 2001 Thanksgiving episode. He later guest starred in a different role in a 2017 episode. Mullally also had a recurring role on her husband's sitcom, Parks and Recreation as Ron Swanson's second former wife, Tammy 2. The couple have also appeared together in films such as The Kings of Summer and Smashed, as well as performing voice work together in Hotel Transylvania 2 and Bob\u2019s Burgers. Offerman and Mullally did a live comedy tour in 2016, the theme of which was their sex life.[16] On whether he is a libertarian like his character Ron Swanson, Offerman has stated, \"While I admire the philosophy of the libertarian mindset, I think it's proven to be ineffectual in actual governance. So no, I'm not. I'm a free-thinking American.\"[17]",

He is best known for his role as Ron Swanson in the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation, for which he received the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy and was twice nominated for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Offerman is also known for his role in The Founder, in which he portrays Richard McDonald, one of the brothers who developed the fast food chain McDonald's. His first major television role since the end of Parks and Recreation was as Karl Weathers in the FX series Fargo, for which he received a Critics' Choice Television Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie/Miniseries.\nOfferman was born in Joliet, Illinois and grew up in nearby Minooka.[1] He is the son of Cathy (n\u00e9e Roberts), a nurse, and Ric Offerman, who taught social studies at a junior high school in nearby Channahon.[2][3] Offerman was raised Catholic.[4][5] He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 1993.[1] That year, he and a group of fellow students co-founded the Defiant Theatre, a Chicago-based theatre company.[1]\nOfferman lived in Chicago in the mid-1990s, where he participated with theatre companies such as Steppenwolf, Goodman, and Wisdom Bridge. At Steppenwolf, he also worked as a fight choreographer and master carpenter.[6] During this time, Offerman became acquainted with Amy Poehler, who was heavily involved with the Chicago improv comedy scene.[1]\nIn 2003, he married Will &amp; Grace actress Megan Mullally. Offerman has also appeared on her talk show, The Megan Mullally Show. At the same time, he began appearing on television as a plumber on Will &amp; Grace during its fourth season's Thanksgiving episode, on The King of Queens, in three episodes of 24, and in an episode of The West Wing. Prior to Parks and Recreation, his most prominent role was as factory worker and Benny Lopez's love interest Randy McGee on George Lopez. He appeared twice on Gilmore Girls, in 2003's \"The Festival of Living Art\" and 2005's \"Always a Godmother, Never a God\" and in the third-season episode of Monk, \"Mr. Monk and the Election\" as a helper for the campaign of Natalie Teeger.  In 2007, Offerman co-starred in the Comedy Central series American Body Shop.\nIn 2009, The Office producers Michael Schur and Greg Daniels offered Offerman a regular supporting role in their NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation: that of Ron Swanson, the deadpan, government-hating, libertarian head of a city parks department and boss of Amy Poehler's character Leslie Knope.[1] Slate magazine declared Offerman \"Parks and Recreation's secret weapon\", and said he regularly stole scenes and \"has a gift for understated physical comedy.\"[7] The role weaves antagonism and political philosophy with humanity, while the intense libertarian philosophy the character lives out is often played off against the equally intense liberalism and 'do-gooder' mentality of Poehler's character.  Offerman said that supporting parts such as that of Parks and Recreation are his ideal roles, and that he draws particular inspiration from Reverend Jim Ignatowski, the character played by Christopher Lloyd in the sitcom Taxi.[1]\nOfferman has also been featured in the Adult Swim series Childrens Hospital with Rob Corddry and Rob Huebel. He is the voice of Axe Cop in the animated series of the same name that premiered on July 27, 2013.[8] In the same year, Offerman portrayed Johnny Cool in the \"Boston\" episode of Derek Waters' Drunk History on Comedy Central.\nOfferman has appeared in films, such as November (2004), Cursed (2005), Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2005), Sin City (2005), The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009) and The Kings of Summer (2013). He also appeared in the 2006 film Wristcutters: A Love Story as a cop who attempts to arrest Shannyn Sossamon's character, Mikal. 2012 saw him in two film roles, as 21 Jump Street's Deputy Chief Hardy and in Casa de Mi Padre as DEA Agent Parker. He reprised his role as Deputy Chief Hardy in 22 Jump Street two years later. Additionally, he starred in and produced an independent film, Somebody Up There Likes Me (2012), shot in Austin, Texas. He appeared in the 2013 comedy We're the Millers, which starred Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston, and voiced MetalBeard in The Lego Movie. Offerman conceived of and starred in punk band FIDLAR's 2013 video for their song \"Cocaine\".[9] Offerman also played an alcoholic college guidance counselor in Believe Me (2014). Offerman played the recurring role Karl Weathers in the second season of Fargo (2015). Offerman voiced Grandpa Mike alongside wife Megan Mullally who voiced Grandma Linda in Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015). He portrayed the first establisher of McDonald's, Dick McDonald, in The Founder (2016). Offerman also starred in alternative rock band They Might Be Giants' 2018 video for their song \"The Greatest\".[10]\nIn addition to acting, Offerman is also a professional boat builder and has a side business as a wood craftsman. Offerman makes furniture and other wooden structures such as canoes and boats at his woodshop.[11] He also released an instructional DVD in 2008 titled Fine Woodstrip Canoe Building with Nick Offerman, shot by Jimmy DiResta. DiResta's pay for shooting the DVD was a canoe, the second Offerman has built.[12]\nOfferman has released three semi-autobiographical publications: the first, Paddle Your Own Canoe: One Man's Fundamentals for Delicious Living was released in 2013; his second, Gumption: Relighting the Torch of Freedom with America's Gutsiest Troublemakers, was released May 26, 2015; the third, Good Clean Fun: Misadventures in Sawdust at Offerman Woodshop, was released October 18, 2016.\nAs of July 2019, Offerman is currently on tour visiting 37 cities across America. His All Rise Tour kicked off on July 20, 2019, in Thackerville and will continue through the rest of 2019, hitting major city: Chicago, San Francisco, Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York, Detroit and Atlanta. Back in 2017, Offerman launched his Full Bush Tour which consisted of 28 shows across the U.S. and Canada.[13]\nOfferman married actress Megan Mullally on September 20, 2003.[14] They met while acting in The Berlin Circle,[15] a play produced by the Evidence Room Theatre Company, and married after dating for 18 months. While they were still dating, Offerman appeared in a guest role on Mullally's sitcom, Will &amp; Grace, in a 2001 Thanksgiving episode. He later guest starred in a different role in a 2017 episode. Mullally also had a recurring role on her husband's sitcom, Parks and Recreation as Ron Swanson's second former wife, Tammy 2. The couple have also appeared together in films such as The Kings of Summer and Smashed, as well as performing voice work together in Hotel Transylvania 2 and Bob\u2019s Burgers.\nOfferman and Mullally did a live comedy tour in 2016, the theme of which was their sex life.[16]\nOn whether he is a libertarian like his character Ron Swanson, Offerman has stated, \"While I admire the philosophy of the libertarian mindset, I think it's proven to be ineffectual in actual governance. So no, I'm not. I'm a free-thinking American.\"[17]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson (/d\u0259\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6s/; born October 5, 1958) is an American astrophysicist, author, and science communicator. Since 1996, he has been the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City. The center is part of the American Museum of Natural History, where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003. Tyson studied at Harvard University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University. From 1991 to 1994, he was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the \"Universe\" column for Natural History magazine, some of which were later published in his books Death by Black Hole (2007) and Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in StarDate magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name \"Merlin\". Material from the column appeared in his books Merlin's Tour of the Universe (1998) and Just Visiting This Planet (1998). Tyson served on a 2001 government commission on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry and on the 2004 Moon, Mars and Beyond commission. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show NOVA ScienceNow on PBS. Since 2009, Tyson has hosted the weekly podcast StarTalk. A spin-off, also called StarTalk, began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, a successor to Carl Sagan's 1980 series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.[1] The U.S. National Academy of Sciences awarded Tyson the Public Welfare Medal in 2015 for his \"extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science\".[2] Tyson was born in Manhattan as the second of three children, into a family living in the Bronx.[3] His mother, Sunchita Maria Tyson (n\u00e9e Feliciano), was a gerontologist for the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and is of Puerto Rican descent.[4] His African-American father, Cyril deGrasse Tyson (1927\u20132016), was a sociologist, human resource commissioner for New York City mayor John Lindsay, and the first Director of Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited.[5][6] Tyson has two siblings: Stephen Joseph Tyson and Lynn Antipas Tyson.[5] Tyson's middle name, deGrasse, is from the maiden name of his paternal grandmother, who was born as Altima de Grasse in the British West Indies island of Nevis.[7] Tyson grew up in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx, and later in Riverdale.[8] From kindergarten throughout high school, Tyson attended public schools in the Bronx: P.S. 36, P.S. 81, the Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy (then called \"P.S. 141\"), and The Bronx High School of Science (1972\u20131976) where he was captain of the wrestling team and editor-in-chief of the Physical Science Journal.[9][10] His interest in astronomy began at the age of nine after visiting the sky theater of the Hayden Planetarium.[11] He recalled that \"so strong was that imprint [of the night sky] that I'm certain that I had no choice in the matter, that in fact, the universe called me.\"[12] During high school, Tyson attended astronomy courses offered by the Hayden Planetarium, which he called \"the most formative period\" of his life. He credited Dr. Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his \"first intellectual role model\" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.[13] Tyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.[14] Astronomer Carl Sagan, who was a faculty member at Cornell University, tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for undergraduate studies.[6] In his book, The Sky Is Not the Limit, Tyson wrote: My letter of application had been dripping with an interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me, had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention. Within weeks, I received a personal letter...[15] Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in Ithaca. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, \"I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become.\"[16][17] Tyson chose to attend Harvard where he majored in physics and lived in Currier House. He was a member of the crew team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, lettering in his senior year. He was also active in dance, in styles including jazz, ballet, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin Ballroom.[18] Tyson earned an AB degree in physics at Harvard College in 1980 and then began his graduate work at the University of Texas at Austin,[19] from which he received an MA degree in astronomy in 1983. By his own account, he did not spend as much time in the research lab as he should have. His professors encouraged him to consider alternative careers and the committee for his doctoral dissertation was dissolved, ending his pursuit of a doctorate from the University of Texas.[20] Tyson was a lecturer in astronomy at the University of Maryland from 1986 to 1987[21] and in 1988, he was accepted into the astronomy graduate program at Columbia University, where he earned an MPhil degree in astrophysics in 1989, and a PhD degree in astrophysics in 1991[22] under the supervision of Professor R. Michael Rich. Rich obtained funding to support Tyson's doctoral research from NASA and the ARCS foundation[23] enabling Tyson to attend international meetings in Italy, Switzerland, Chile, and South Africa[21] and to hire students to help him with data reduction.[24] In the course of his thesis work, he observed using the 0.91 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, where he obtained images for the Cal\u00e1n/Tololo Supernova Survey[25][26][27] helping to further their work in establishing Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. During his thesis research at Columbia University, Tyson became acquainted with Professor David Spergel at Princeton University, who visited Columbia University in the course of collaborating with his thesis advisor on the Galactic bulge[28][29][30] typically found in spiral galaxies. Tyson's research has focused on observations in cosmology, stellar evolution, galactic astronomy, bulges, and stellar formation. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the University of Maryland, Princeton University, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Hayden Planetarium. In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.[31] As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said \"when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me\".[32] Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the \"Universe\" column for Natural History magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called \"City of Stars\", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term \"Manhattanhenge\" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the street grid in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the Stonehenge monument in England.[33] Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with The Great Courses.[34] In 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush appointed Tyson to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry and in 2004 to serve on the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy, the latter better known as the \"Moon, Mars, and Beyond\" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.[35] In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part Origins miniseries of the PBS Nova series,[36] and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution.[37] He again collaborated with Goldsmith as the narrator on the documentary 400 Years of the Telescope, which premiered on PBS in April 2009.[38] As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep Pluto from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, and BBC Horizon that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.[39] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the dwarf planet classification. Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the Cambridge Conference Network (CCNet), a \"widely read, UK-based Internet chat group\", following Benny Peiser's renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.[40] Peiser's entry, in which he posted articles from the AP and The Boston Globe, spawned from The New York Times's article entitled \"Pluto's Not a Planet? Only in New York\".[41][42] Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the Planetary Society. He was also the host of the PBS program Nova ScienceNow until 2011.[43] He attended and was a speaker at the Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on The History Channel's popular series The Universe.[citation needed] In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called StarTalk, which he co-hosted with comedian Lynne Koplitz. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on KTLK AM in Los Angeles and WHFS in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians Chuck Nice and Leighann Lord instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as GZA, Wil Wheaton, Sarah Silverman, and Bill Maher. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a podcast.[44] In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and James Randi delivered a lecture entitled Skepticism, which related directly with the convention's theme of The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise.[45] In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show StarTalk. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the Nerdist YouTube Channel.[46] On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the White House Student Film Festival.[47] In 2014, Tyson helped revive Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage television series, presenting Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel. Thirteen episodes were aired in the first season, and Tyson has stated that if a second season were produced, he would pass the role of host to someone else in the science world.[48][49] In early January, 2018, it was announced that a second season of Cosmos was in production, and that Tyson would once again act as host.[50] On April 20, 2015, Tyson began hosting a late-night talk show entitled StarTalk on the National Geographic Channel, where Tyson interviews pop culture celebrities and asks them about their life experiences with science.[51] Tyson is co-developing a sandbox video game with Whatnot Entertainment, Neil deGrasse Tyson Presents: Space Odyssey, which aims to help provide players with a realistic simulation of developing a space-faring culture, incorporating educational materials about space and technology. The game was anticipated for release in 2018.[52] \u2014Neil deGrasse Tyson, from a transcript of an interview by Roger Bingham on The Science Network[53][54] Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays \"The Perimeter of Ignorance\"[55] and \"Holy Wars\",[56] both appearing in Natural History magazine and the 2006 Beyond Belief workshop. In an interview with comedian Paul Mecurio, Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: \"For me, when I say spiritual, I\u2019m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe.\"[57] Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in intelligent design limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.[56][58] When asked during a question session at the University at Buffalo if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: \"Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.\"[59][60]:341 In an interview with Big Think, Tyson said, \"So, what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be 'agnostic' ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all.\"[61] Additionally, in the same interview with Big Think, Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page \u2013 I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it \u2013 and it said \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist.\" I said, \"Well that's not really true.\" I said, \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic.\" I went back a week later, it said \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist\" again \u2013 within a week! \u2013 and I said, \"What's up with that?\" and I said \"Alright, I have to word it a little differently.\" So I said, okay \"Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic.\"[61]During the interview \"Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson\" in 2009, Tyson said: \"I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care.\"[62] In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent Massimo Pigliucci asked Tyson \"What is it you think about God?\" Tyson replied \"I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe.\" Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label \"atheist\" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying \"That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist'.\" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist Richard Dawkins: \"[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not.\" Tyson replied: \"I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there.\"[63] Tyson has spoken about philosophy on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of The Nerdist Podcast, he stated that philosophy is \"useless\" and that a philosophy major \"can really mess you up\",[64] which was met with disapproval.[65][66][67][68] The philosopher Massimo Pigliucci later criticized him for \"dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise\".[69] In an undated interview at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a plasma burst from the sun on a local Fox affiliate in 1989. \"I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine.\"[70][71] In 2005, at a conference at the National Academy of Sciences, Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was \"...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society\". He continued: \"My life experience tells me, when you don\u2019t find blacks in the sciences, when you don\u2019t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there\u2019s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation.\"[72] In a 2014 interview with Grantland, Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. \"I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level.\" In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, \"[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message.\" He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. \"I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview.\"[73] Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Arguing that \"the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing\".[74] Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, \"By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny.\"[74] In March 2012, Tyson testified before the United States Senate Science Committee, stating that: Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that\u2014a penny on a dollar\u2014we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.[75][76]Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, Penny4NASA, a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,[77] was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.[78] In his book Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting humans to Mars, will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the United States Federal government.[79] As a science communicator, Tyson regularly appears on television, radio, and various other media outlets. He has been a regular guest on The Colbert Report, and host Stephen Colbert refers to him in his comedic book I Am America (And So Can You!), noting in his chapter on scientists that most scientists are \"decent, well-intentioned people\", but, presumably tongue-in-cheek, that \"Neil DeGrasse [sic] Tyson is an absolute monster.\"[80] He has appeared numerous times on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. He has made appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and The Rachel Maddow Show.[81] He served as one of the central interviewees on the various episodes of the History Channel science program, The Universe. Tyson participated on the NPR radio quiz program Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in 2007 and 2015.[82] He has appeared several times on Real Time with Bill Maher, and he was also featured on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? as the ask-the-expert lifeline.[83] He has spoken numerous times on the Philadelphia morning show, Preston and Steve, on 93.3 WMMR, as well as on SiriusXM's Ron and Fez and The Opie and Anthony Show. Tyson has been featured as a guest interviewee on The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Radiolab, Skepticality, and The Joe Rogan Experience podcasts and has been in several of the Symphony of Science videos.[84][85] Tyson lived near the World Trade Center and was an eyewitness to the September 11, 2001 attacks. He wrote a widely circulated letter on what he saw.[86] Footage he filmed on the day was included in the 2008 documentary film 102 Minutes That Changed America.[87] In 2007, Tyson was the keynote speaker during the dedication ceremony of Deerfield Academy's new science center, the Koch Center, named for David H. Koch '59. He emphasized the impact science will have on the twenty-first century, as well as explaining that investments into science may be costly, but their returns in the form of knowledge gained and piquing interest is invaluable. Tyson has also appeared as the keynote speaker at The Amazing Meeting, a science and skepticism conference hosted by the James Randi Educational Foundation.[88] Tyson made a guest appearance as a version of himself in the episode \"Brain Storm\" of Stargate Atlantis[89] alongside Bill Nye and in the episode \"The Apology Insufficiency\" of The Big Bang Theory.[90] Archive footage of him is used in the film Europa Report. Tyson also made an appearance in an episode of Martha Speaks as himself.[91] In a May 2011 StarTalk Radio show, The Political Science of the Daily Show, Tyson said he donates all income earned as a guest speaker.[92] Tyson is a frequent participant in the website Reddit's AMAs (Ask Me Anythings) where he is responsible for three of the top ten most popular AMAs of all time.[93] In Action Comics #14 (January 2013), which was published November 7, 2012, Tyson appears in the story, in which he determines that Superman's home planet, Krypton, orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus 27.1 lightyears from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star that would be an appropriate parent star to Krypton, and picked Corvus, which is Latin for \"Crow\",[94][95] and which is the mascot of Superman's high school, the Smallville Crows.[96][97] Tyson also had a minor appearance as himself in the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[citation needed] In May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 (H.R. 1891; 113th Congress) was introduced into Congress. Neil deGrasse Tyson was listed by at least two commentators as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass.[98][99] On March 8, 2014, Tyson made a SXSW Interactive keynote presentation at the Austin Convention Center.[100] On June 3, 2014, Tyson co-reviewed Gravity in a CinemaSins episode.[101] He made two more appearances with CinemaSins, co-reviewing Interstellar on September 29, 2015,[102] and The Martian on March 31, 2016.[103] In 2016, Tyson narrated and was a script supervisor for the science documentary, Food Evolution, directed by Academy Award nominated director Scott Hamilton Kennedy.[104] In the same year, Tyson made a guest appearance on the Avenged Sevenfold album The Stage, where he delivered a monolog on the track \"Exist\".[105] In 2017, Tyson appeared on Logic's album Everybody as God, uncredited on various tracks, and credited on the song \"AfricAryaN\"[106] as well as on \"The Moon\" on Musiq Soulchild's album Feel the Real.[107] In 2018, Tyson made a guest appearance on The Big Bang Theory as himself, together with fellow scientist Bill Nye, in the first episode of the show's final season (\"The Conjugal Configuration\").[108] Tyson lives in the Tribeca neighborhood[109] of Lower Manhattan with his wife, Alice Young. They have two children: Miranda and Travis.[110][111] Tyson met his wife in a physics class at the University of Texas at Austin. They married in 1988 and named their first child Miranda, after the smallest of Uranus' five major moons.[112] Tyson is a wine enthusiast whose collection was featured in the May 2000 issue of the Wine Spectator and the Spring 2005 issue of The World of Fine Wine.[113][114] During November and December 2018, accusations of sexual misconduct were raised against Tyson by four women.[115][116][117] Thchiya Amet El Maat accused Tyson of drugging and raping her while both were graduate students at UT Austin in 1984.[118] Katelyn Allers, a professor at Bucknell University, alleged Tyson touched her inappropriately at a 2009 American Astronomical Society gathering.[119][120] She had a tattoo of the solar system which went from her arm to collar bone and said he was looking for Pluto.[121] Ashley Watson, Tyson's assistant on Cosmos, alleged Tyson made inappropriate sexual advances on her in 2018 which led her to resign from the position days later.[119][120] In what Tyson described as a Native American handshake, he held her hand and looked her in the eye for ten seconds. When she left, he told her he wanted to hug her but would rather not in case he wanted more.[121] A fourth anonymous woman alleged Tyson made inappropriate comments to her during a 2010 holiday party at the American Museum of Natural History.[115] Tyson denied El Maat's rape accusation, while corroborating the basic facts around the situation of Allers and Watson's assertions, but claimed his actions were misinterpreted and apologized for any misunderstanding or offense.[122][123][124] Fox, National Geographic, the Museum of Natural History, and the producers of Cosmos announced investigations, which Tyson stated that he welcomed.[125] The National Geographic Channel announced on January 3, 2019, that they were putting further episodes of StarTalk on hiatus as \"to allow the investigation to occur unimpeded\".[126][127] The premiere of Cosmos: Possible Worlds, initially scheduled for March 3, 2019, was also delayed while the investigation continued.[128] On March 15, 2019, both National Geographic and Fox announced that \"The investigation is complete, and we are moving forward with both StarTalk and Cosmos,\" and that \"There will be no further comment.\" The networks affirmed that both StarTalk and Cosmos would resume, but that no date had been set.[129] In July, the American Museum of Natural History stated Neil deGrasse Tyson would keep his job as director of the Hayden Planetarium.[121] List of awards received by Tyson:[114] List of works by Tyson:[149]",

Since 1996, he has been the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City. The center is part of the American Museum of Natural History, where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.\nTyson studied at Harvard University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University. From 1991 to 1994, he was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the \"Universe\" column for Natural History magazine, some of which were later published in his books Death by Black Hole (2007) and Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in StarDate magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name \"Merlin\". Material from the column appeared in his books Merlin's Tour of the Universe (1998) and Just Visiting This Planet (1998). Tyson served on a 2001 government commission on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry and on the 2004 Moon, Mars and Beyond commission. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show NOVA ScienceNow on PBS. Since 2009, Tyson has hosted the weekly podcast StarTalk. A spin-off, also called StarTalk, began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, a successor to Carl Sagan's 1980 series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.[1] The U.S. National Academy of Sciences awarded Tyson the Public Welfare Medal in 2015 for his \"extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science\".[2]\nTyson was born in Manhattan as the second of three children, into a family living in the Bronx.[3] His mother, Sunchita Maria Tyson (n\u00e9e Feliciano), was a gerontologist for the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and is of Puerto Rican descent.[4] His African-American father, Cyril deGrasse Tyson (1927\u20132016), was a sociologist, human resource commissioner for New York City mayor John Lindsay, and the first Director of Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited.[5][6] Tyson has two siblings: Stephen Joseph Tyson and Lynn Antipas Tyson.[5] Tyson's middle name, deGrasse, is from the maiden name of his paternal grandmother, who was born as Altima de Grasse in the British West Indies island of Nevis.[7]\nTyson grew up in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx, and later in Riverdale.[8] From kindergarten throughout high school, Tyson attended public schools in the Bronx: P.S. 36, P.S. 81, the Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy (then called \"P.S. 141\"), and The Bronx High School of Science (1972\u20131976) where he was captain of the wrestling team and editor-in-chief of the Physical Science Journal.[9][10] His interest in astronomy began at the age of nine after visiting the sky theater of the Hayden Planetarium.[11] He recalled that \"so strong was that imprint [of the night sky] that I'm certain that I had no choice in the matter, that in fact, the universe called me.\"[12] During high school, Tyson attended astronomy courses offered by the Hayden Planetarium, which he called \"the most formative period\" of his life. He credited Dr. Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his \"first intellectual role model\" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.[13]\nTyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.[14] Astronomer Carl Sagan, who was a faculty member at Cornell University, tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for undergraduate studies.[6] In his book, The Sky Is Not the Limit, Tyson wrote:\nMy letter of application had been dripping with an interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me, had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention. Within weeks, I received a personal letter...[15]\nTyson revisited this moment on his first episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in Ithaca. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, \"I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become.\"[16][17]\nTyson chose to attend Harvard where he majored in physics and lived in Currier House. He was a member of the crew team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, lettering in his senior year. He was also active in dance, in styles including jazz, ballet, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin Ballroom.[18]\nTyson earned an AB degree in physics at Harvard College in 1980 and then began his graduate work at the University of Texas at Austin,[19] from which he received an MA degree in astronomy in 1983. By his own account, he did not spend as much time in the research lab as he should have. His professors encouraged him to consider alternative careers and the committee for his doctoral dissertation was dissolved, ending his pursuit of a doctorate from the University of Texas.[20]\nTyson was a lecturer in astronomy at the University of Maryland from 1986 to 1987[21] and in 1988, he was accepted into the astronomy graduate program at Columbia University, where he earned an MPhil degree in astrophysics in 1989, and a PhD degree in astrophysics in 1991[22] under the supervision of Professor R. Michael Rich. Rich obtained funding to support Tyson's doctoral research from NASA and the ARCS foundation[23] enabling Tyson to attend international meetings in Italy, Switzerland, Chile, and South Africa[21] and to hire students to help him with data reduction.[24] In the course of his thesis work, he observed using the 0.91 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, where he obtained images for the Cal\u00e1n/Tololo Supernova Survey[25][26][27] helping to further their work in establishing Type Ia supernovae as standard candles.\nDuring his thesis research at Columbia University, Tyson became acquainted with Professor David Spergel at Princeton University, who visited Columbia University in the course of collaborating with his thesis advisor on the Galactic bulge[28][29][30] typically found in spiral galaxies.\nTyson's research has focused on observations in cosmology, stellar evolution, galactic astronomy, bulges, and stellar formation. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the University of Maryland, Princeton University, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Hayden Planetarium.\nIn 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.[31] As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said \"when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me\".[32]\nTyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the \"Universe\" column for Natural History magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called \"City of Stars\", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term \"Manhattanhenge\" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the street grid in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the Stonehenge monument in England.[33] Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with The Great Courses.[34]\nIn 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush appointed Tyson to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry and in 2004 to serve on the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy, the latter better known as the \"Moon, Mars, and Beyond\" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.[35]\nIn 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part Origins miniseries of the PBS Nova series,[36] and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution.[37] He again collaborated with Goldsmith as the narrator on the documentary 400 Years of the Telescope, which premiered on PBS in April 2009.[38]\nAs director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep Pluto from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, and BBC Horizon that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.[39] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the dwarf planet classification.\nTyson recounted the heated online debate on the Cambridge Conference Network (CCNet), a \"widely read, UK-based Internet chat group\", following Benny Peiser's renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.[40] Peiser's entry, in which he posted articles from the AP and The Boston Globe, spawned from The New York Times's article entitled \"Pluto's Not a Planet? Only in New York\".[41][42]\nTyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the Planetary Society. He was also the host of the PBS program Nova ScienceNow until 2011.[43] He attended and was a speaker at the Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on The History Channel's popular series The Universe.[citation needed]\nIn May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called StarTalk, which he co-hosted with comedian Lynne Koplitz. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on KTLK AM in Los Angeles and WHFS in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians Chuck Nice and Leighann Lord instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as GZA, Wil Wheaton, Sarah Silverman, and Bill Maher. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a podcast.[44]\nIn April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and James Randi delivered a lecture entitled Skepticism, which related directly with the convention's theme of The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise.[45]\nIn 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show StarTalk. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the Nerdist YouTube Channel.[46] On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the White House Student Film Festival.[47]\nIn 2014, Tyson helped revive Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage television series, presenting Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel. Thirteen episodes were aired in the first season, and Tyson has stated that if a second season were produced, he would pass the role of host to someone else in the science world.[48][49] In early January, 2018, it was announced that a second season of Cosmos was in production, and that Tyson would once again act as host.[50]\nOn April 20, 2015, Tyson began hosting a late-night talk show entitled StarTalk on the National Geographic Channel, where Tyson interviews pop culture celebrities and asks them about their life experiences with science.[51]\nTyson is co-developing a sandbox video game with Whatnot Entertainment, Neil deGrasse Tyson Presents: Space Odyssey, which aims to help provide players with a realistic simulation of developing a space-faring culture, incorporating educational materials about space and technology. The game was anticipated for release in 2018.[52]\n\u2014Neil deGrasse Tyson, from a transcript of an interview by Roger Bingham on The Science Network[53][54]\nTyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays \"The Perimeter of Ignorance\"[55] and \"Holy Wars\",[56] both appearing in Natural History magazine and the 2006 Beyond Belief workshop. In an interview with comedian Paul Mecurio, Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: \"For me, when I say spiritual, I\u2019m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe.\"[57] Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in intelligent design limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.[56][58]\n\nWhen asked during a question session at the University at Buffalo if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: \"Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.\"[59][60]:341 In an interview with Big Think, Tyson said, \"So, what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be 'agnostic' ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all.\"[61]  Additionally, in the same interview with Big Think, Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page \u2013 I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it \u2013 and it said \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist.\" I said, \"Well that's not really true.\" I said, \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic.\" I went back a week later, it said \"Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist\" again \u2013 within a week! \u2013 and I said, \"What's up with that?\" and I said \"Alright, I have to word it a little differently.\" So I said, okay \"Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic.\"[61]During the interview \"Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson\" in 2009, Tyson said: \"I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care.\"[62]\nIn March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent Massimo Pigliucci asked Tyson \"What is it you think about God?\" Tyson replied \"I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe.\"  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label \"atheist\" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying \"That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist'.\" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist Richard Dawkins: \"[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not.\" Tyson replied: \"I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there.\"[63]\nTyson has spoken about philosophy on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of The Nerdist Podcast, he stated that philosophy is \"useless\" and that a philosophy major \"can really mess you up\",[64] which was met with disapproval.[65][66][67][68] The philosopher Massimo Pigliucci later criticized him for \"dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise\".[69]\nIn an undated interview at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a plasma burst from the sun on a local Fox affiliate in 1989. \"I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine.\"[70][71]\nIn 2005, at a conference at the National Academy of Sciences, Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was \"...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society\". He continued: \"My life experience tells me, when you don\u2019t find blacks in the sciences, when you don\u2019t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there\u2019s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation.\"[72]\nIn a 2014 interview with Grantland, Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. \"I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level.\" In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, \"[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message.\" He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. \"I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview.\"[73]\nTyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Arguing that \"the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing\".[74] Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, \"By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny.\"[74]\nIn March 2012, Tyson testified before the United States Senate Science Committee, stating that:\nRight now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that\u2014a penny on a dollar\u2014we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.[75][76]Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, Penny4NASA, a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,[77] was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.[78]\nIn his book Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting humans to Mars, will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the United States Federal government.[79]\nAs a science communicator, Tyson regularly appears on television, radio, and various other media outlets. He has been a regular guest on The Colbert Report, and host Stephen Colbert refers to him in his comedic book I Am America (And So Can You!), noting in his chapter on scientists that most scientists are \"decent, well-intentioned people\", but, presumably tongue-in-cheek, that \"Neil DeGrasse [sic] Tyson is an absolute monster.\"[80] He has appeared numerous times on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. He has made appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and The Rachel Maddow Show.[81] He served as one of the central interviewees on the various episodes of the History Channel science program, The Universe. Tyson participated on the NPR radio quiz program Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in 2007 and 2015.[82] He has appeared several times on Real Time with Bill Maher, and he was also featured on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? as the ask-the-expert lifeline.[83] He has spoken numerous times on the Philadelphia morning show, Preston and Steve, on 93.3 WMMR, as well as on SiriusXM's Ron and Fez and The Opie and Anthony Show.\nTyson has been featured as a guest interviewee on The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Radiolab, Skepticality, and The Joe Rogan Experience podcasts and has been in several of the Symphony of Science videos.[84][85]\nTyson lived near the World Trade Center and was an eyewitness to the September 11, 2001 attacks. He wrote a widely circulated letter on what he saw.[86] Footage he filmed on the day was included in the 2008 documentary film 102 Minutes That Changed America.[87]\nIn 2007, Tyson was the keynote speaker during the dedication ceremony of Deerfield Academy's new science center, the Koch Center, named for David H. Koch '59. He emphasized the impact science will have on the twenty-first century, as well as explaining that investments into science may be costly, but their returns in the form of knowledge gained and piquing interest is invaluable. Tyson has also appeared as the keynote speaker at The Amazing Meeting, a science and skepticism conference hosted by the James Randi Educational Foundation.[88]\nTyson made a guest appearance as a version of himself in the episode \"Brain Storm\" of Stargate Atlantis[89] alongside Bill Nye and in the episode \"The Apology Insufficiency\" of The Big Bang Theory.[90] Archive footage of him is used in the film Europa Report. Tyson also made an appearance in an episode of Martha Speaks as himself.[91]\nIn a May 2011 StarTalk Radio show, The Political Science of the Daily Show, Tyson said he donates all income earned as a guest speaker.[92]\nTyson is a frequent participant in the website Reddit's AMAs (Ask Me Anythings) where he is responsible for three of the top ten most popular AMAs of all time.[93]\nIn Action Comics #14 (January 2013), which was published November 7, 2012, Tyson appears in the story, in which he determines that Superman's home planet, Krypton, orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus 27.1 lightyears from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star that would be an appropriate parent star to Krypton, and picked Corvus, which is Latin for \"Crow\",[94][95] and which is the mascot of Superman's high school, the Smallville Crows.[96][97] Tyson also had a minor appearance as himself in the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[citation needed]\nIn May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 (H.R. 1891; 113th Congress) was introduced into Congress. Neil deGrasse Tyson was listed by at least two commentators as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass.[98][99] On March 8, 2014, Tyson made a SXSW Interactive keynote presentation at the Austin Convention Center.[100]\nOn June 3, 2014, Tyson co-reviewed Gravity in a CinemaSins episode.[101] He made two more appearances with CinemaSins, co-reviewing Interstellar on September 29, 2015,[102] and The Martian on March 31, 2016.[103]\nIn 2016, Tyson narrated and was a script supervisor for the science documentary, Food Evolution, directed by Academy Award nominated director Scott Hamilton Kennedy.[104] In the same year, Tyson made a guest appearance on the Avenged Sevenfold album The Stage, where he delivered a monolog on the track \"Exist\".[105] In 2017, Tyson appeared on Logic's album Everybody as God, uncredited on various tracks, and credited on the song \"AfricAryaN\"[106] as well as on \"The Moon\" on Musiq Soulchild's album Feel the Real.[107]\nIn 2018, Tyson made a guest appearance on The Big Bang Theory as himself, together with fellow scientist Bill Nye, in the first episode of the show's final season (\"The Conjugal Configuration\").[108]\nTyson lives in the Tribeca neighborhood[109] of Lower Manhattan with his wife, Alice Young. They have two children: Miranda and Travis.[110][111] Tyson met his wife in a physics class at the University of Texas at Austin. They married in 1988 and named their first child Miranda, after the smallest of Uranus' five major moons.[112] Tyson is a wine enthusiast whose collection was featured in the May 2000 issue of the Wine Spectator and the Spring 2005 issue of The World of Fine Wine.[113][114]\nDuring November and December 2018, accusations of sexual misconduct were raised against Tyson by four women.[115][116][117] Thchiya Amet El Maat accused Tyson of drugging and raping her while both were graduate students at UT Austin in 1984.[118] Katelyn Allers, a professor at Bucknell University, alleged Tyson touched her inappropriately at a 2009 American Astronomical Society gathering.[119][120] She had a tattoo of the solar system which went from her arm to collar bone and said he was looking for Pluto.[121] Ashley Watson, Tyson's assistant on Cosmos, alleged Tyson made inappropriate sexual advances on her in 2018 which led her to resign from the position days later.[119][120] In what Tyson described as a Native American handshake, he held her hand and looked her in the eye for ten seconds. When she left, he told her he wanted to hug her but would rather not in case he wanted more.[121] A fourth anonymous woman alleged Tyson made inappropriate comments to her during a 2010 holiday party at the American Museum of Natural History.[115] Tyson denied El Maat's rape accusation, while corroborating the basic facts around the situation of Allers and Watson's assertions, but claimed his actions were misinterpreted and apologized for any misunderstanding or offense.[122][123][124]\nFox, National Geographic, the Museum of Natural History, and the producers of Cosmos announced investigations, which Tyson stated that he welcomed.[125] The National Geographic Channel announced on January 3, 2019, that they were putting further episodes of StarTalk on hiatus as \"to allow the investigation to occur unimpeded\".[126][127] The premiere of Cosmos: Possible Worlds, initially scheduled for March 3, 2019, was also delayed while the investigation continued.[128]  On March 15, 2019, both National Geographic and Fox announced that \"The investigation is complete, and we are moving forward with both StarTalk and Cosmos,\" and that \"There will be no further comment.\" The networks affirmed that both StarTalk and Cosmos would resume, but that no date had been set.[129] In July, the American Museum of Natural History stated Neil deGrasse Tyson would keep his job as director of the Hayden Planetarium.[121]\nList of awards received by Tyson:[114]\nList of works by Tyson:[149]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nStephen Glenn Martin (born August 14, 1945) is an American actor, comedian, writer, and musician. Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and later as a frequent guest on The Tonight Show. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from comedy, Martin has become a successful actor, as well as an author, playwright, pianist, and banjo player, eventually earning him Emmy, Grammy, and American Comedy awards, among other honors. In 2004, Comedy Central ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics.[1] He was awarded an Honorary Academy Award at the Academy's 5th Annual Governors Awards in 2013.[2] While he has played banjo since an early age, and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career, he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s, acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo, recording, and touring with various bluegrass acts, including Earl Scruggs, with whom he won a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002. He released his first solo music album, The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo, in 2009, for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album. Martin was born on August 14, 1945,[3][4] in Waco, Texas,[5] the son of Mary Lee (n\u00e9e Stewart; 1913\u20132002) and Glenn Vernon Martin (1914\u20131997), a real estate salesman and aspiring actor.[6][7] Martin was raised in Inglewood, California, with sister Melinda Martin, and then later in Garden Grove, California, in a Baptist family.[8] Martin was a cheerleader of Garden Grove High School.[9] One of his earliest memories is of seeing his father, as an extra, serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place. During World War II, in the United Kingdom, Martin's father had appeared in a production of Our Town with Raymond Massey. Expressing his affection through gifts, like cars and bikes, Martin's father was stern, and not emotionally open to his son.[10] He was proud but critical, with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of hatred.[11] Martin's first job was at Disneyland, selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during his school's summer break. That lasted for three years (1955\u20131958). During his free time, he frequented the Main Street Magic shop, where tricks were demonstrated to patrons.[10] While working at Disneyland, he was captured in the background of the home movie that was made into the short-subject film Disneyland Dream, incidentally becoming his first film appearance. By 1960, he had mastered several magic tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the Magic shop in Fantasyland in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor Wally Boag,[12] frequently performing for tips.[13] In his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could \"be described most accurately as an agnostic ... he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition\".[14] In his early 20s, Martin dated Melissa Trumbo, daughter of novelist and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. After high school, Martin attended Santa Ana College, taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and Garden Grove High School classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at Knott's Berry Farm.[10] Later, he met budding actress Stormie Sherk, and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherk's influence caused Martin to apply to the California State University, Long Beach, for enrollment with a major in philosophy.[10] Sherk enrolled at UCLA, about an hour's drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.[15] Inspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor\u2013comedian. His time at college changed his life. Martin recalls reading a treatise on comedy that led him to think: Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology. In 1967, Martin transferred to UCLA and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of The Dating Game. Martin began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices, and at twenty-one, he dropped out of college.[19] In 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer Mason Williams.[20] Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an Emmy Award[21] in 1969, aged 23.[10] He also wrote for The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, and The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Martin's first TV appearance was on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1968. He says: During these years his roommates included comedian Gary Mule Deer and singer/guitarist Michael Johnson.[23] Martin opened for groups such as The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (who returned the favor by appearing in his 1980 television special All Commercials), The Carpenters, and Toto. He appeared at San Francisco's The Boarding House, among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on Van Dyke and Company in 1976. In the mid-1970s, Martin made frequent appearances as a stand-up comedian on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,[22] and on The Gong Show, HBO's On Location, The Muppet Show,[24] and NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL). SNL's audience jumped by a million viewers when he made guest appearances, and he was one of the show's most successful hosts.[10] Martin appeared on 27 Saturday Night Live shows and he guest-hosted 15 times, bested only in number of presentations by host Alec Baldwin (who has hosted 17 times as of February\u00a02017[update]). On the show, Martin popularized the air quotes gesture, which uses four fingers to make double quote marks in the air.[25] While on the show Martin became close with several of the cast members, including Gilda Radner. Radner died of ovarian cancer on May 20, 1989; a visibly shaken Martin hosted SNL that night and featured footage of himself and Radner together in a 1978 sketch. In the 1970s, his TV appearances led to the release of comedy albums that went platinum.[10] The track \"Excuse Me\" on his first album, Let's Get Small (1977), helped establish a national catch phrase.[10] His next album, A Wild and Crazy Guy (1978), was an even bigger success, reaching the No. 2 spot on the U.S. sales chart, selling over a million copies. \"Just a wild and crazy guy\" became another of Martin's known catch phrases.[10] The album featured a character based on a series of Saturday Night Live sketches where Martin and Dan Aykroyd played the Festrunk Brothers; Yortuk and Georgi were bumbling Czechoslovak would-be playboys. The album ends with the song \"King Tut\", sung and written by Martin and backed by the \"Toot Uncommons\", members of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. It was later released as a single, reaching No. 17 on the U.S. charts in 1978 and selling over a million copies.[10][26] The song came out during the King Tut craze that accompanied the popular traveling exhibit of the Egyptian king's tomb artifacts. Both albums won Grammys for Best Comedy Recording in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Martin performed \"King Tut\" on the April 22, 1978 edition of SNL. Decades later, in 2012, The A.V. Club described Martin's unique style and its impact on audiences: On his comedy albums, Martin's stand-up is self-referential and sometimes self-mocking. It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of \"happy feet\", banjo playing with balloon depictions of concepts like venereal disease, and the \"controversial\" kitten juggling (he is a master juggler; the \"kittens\" were stuffed animals). His style is off-kilter and ironic and sometimes pokes fun at stand-up comedy traditions, such as Martin opening his act (from A Wild and Crazy Guy) by saying: Or: \"Hello, I'm Steve Martin, and I'll be out here in a minute.\"[25][28] In one comedy routine, used on the Comedy Is Not Pretty! album, Martin claimed that his real name was \"Gern Blanston\". The riff took on a life of its own. There is a Gern Blanston website, and for a time a rock band took the moniker as its name.[29] With this kind of outstanding success, Martin's show soon required full sized stadiums for the audiences he was drawing. Concerned about his visibility in venues on such a scale, Martin began to wear a distinctive three piece white suit that became a trademark for his act.[30] Martin stopped doing stand-up comedy in 1981 to concentrate on movies and did not return for 35 years.[10] About this decision, he states: In 2016, Martin made a rare return to comedy, opening for Jerry Seinfeld. He performed a 10-minute routine before turning the stage over to Seinfeld.[32] Later in 2016 he returned to stand-up comedy, staging a national tour with Martin Short and the Steep Canyon Rangers, which yielded a 2018 Netflix comedy special, Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life.[33] By the end of the 1970s, Martin had acquired the kind of following normally reserved for rock stars, with his tour appearances typically occurring at sold-out arenas filled with tens of thousands of screaming fans. But unknown to his audience, stand-up comedy was \"just an accident\" for him; his real goal was to get into film.[16] Martin had a small role in the 1972 film Another Nice Mess. His first substantial film appearance was in a short titled The Absent-Minded Waiter (1977). The seven-minute-long film, also featuring Buck Henry and Teri Garr, was written by and starred Martin. The film was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Short Film, Live Action. He made his first substantial feature film appearance in the musical Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, where he sang The Beatles' \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\". In 1979, Martin starred in the comedy film The Jerk, directed by Carl Reiner, and written by Martin, Michael Elias, and Carl Gottlieb. The film was a huge success, grossing over $100\u00a0million on a budget of approximately $4\u00a0million.[34] Stanley Kubrick met with him to discuss the possibility of Martin starring in a screwball comedy version of Traumnovelle (Kubrick later changed his approach to the material, the result of which was 1999's Eyes Wide Shut). Martin was executive producer for Domestic Life, a prime-time television series starring friend Martin Mull, and a late-night series called Twilight Theater. It emboldened Martin to try his hand at his first serious film, Pennies from Heaven (1981), based on the 1978 BBC serial by Dennis Potter. He was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being typecast. To prepare for that film, Martin took acting lessons from director Herbert Ross and spent months learning how to tap dance. The film was a financial failure; Martin's comment at the time was \"I don't know what to blame, other than it's me and not a comedy.\"[35] Martin was in three more Reiner-directed comedies after The Jerk: Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid in 1982, The Man with Two Brains in 1983 and All of Me in 1984, his most critically acclaimed performance up to that point.[36][37] In 1986, Martin joined fellow Saturday Night Live veterans Martin Short and Chevy Chase in \u00a1Three Amigos!, directed by John Landis, and written by Martin, Lorne Michaels, and singer-songwriter Randy Newman. It was originally entitled The Three Caballeros and Martin was to be teamed with Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. In 1986, Martin was in the movie musical film version of the hit Off-Broadway play Little Shop of Horrors (based on a famous B-movie), playing the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello. The film was the first of three films teaming Martin with Rick Moranis. In 1987, Martin joined comedian John Candy in the John Hughes movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles. That same year, Roxanne, the film adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac which Martin co-wrote, won him a Writers Guild of America Award. It also garnered recognition from Hollywood and the public that he was more than a comedian. In 1988, he performed in the Frank Oz film Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a remake of Bedtime Story, alongside Michael Caine. Also in 1988, he appeared at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center in a revival of Waiting for Godot directed by Mike Nichols.[38] He played Vladimir, with Robin Williams as Estragon and Bill Irwin as Lucky. Martin starred in the Ron Howard film Parenthood, with Rick Moranis in 1989. He later re-teamed with Moranis in the Mafia comedy My Blue Heaven (1990). In 1991, Martin starred in and wrote L.A. Story, a romantic comedy, in which the female lead was played by his then-wife Victoria Tennant. Martin also appeared in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon, in which he played the tightly wound Hollywood film producer, Davis, who was recovering from a traumatic robbery that left him injured, which was a more serious role for him. Martin also starred in a remake of the comedy Father of the Bride in 1991 (followed by a sequel in 1995) and in the 1992 comedy Housesitter, with Goldie Hawn and Dana Delany. In 1994, he starred in A Simple Twist of Fate; a film adaptation of Silas Marner. In David Mamet's 1997 thriller The Spanish Prisoner, Martin played a darker role as a wealthy stranger who takes a suspicious interest in the work of a young businessman (Campbell Scott). He went on to star with Eddie Murphy in the 1999 comedy Bowfinger, which Martin also wrote. In 1998, Martin guest starred with U2 in the 200th episode of The Simpsons titled \"Trash of the Titans\", providing the voice for sanitation commissioner Ray Patterson. In 1999, Martin and Hawn starred in a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon comedy, The Out-of-Towners. By 2003, Martin ranked fourth on the box office stars list, after starring in Bringing Down The House and Cheaper by the Dozen, each of which earned over $130\u00a0million at U.S. theaters. That same year, he also played the villainous Mr. Chairman in the animation/live action blend, Looney Tunes: Back in Action. In 2005, Martin wrote and starred in Shopgirl, based on his own novella (2000), and starred in Cheaper by the Dozen 2. In 2006, he starred in the box office hit The Pink Panther, as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. He reprised the role in 2009's The Pink Panther 2. When combined, the two films grossed over $230\u00a0million at the box office. In Baby Mama (2008), Martin played the founder of a health food company, and in It's Complicated (2009), he played opposite Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. In 2009, an article in The Guardian listed Martin as one of the best actors never to receive an Oscar nomination.[39] In 2011, he appeared with Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and JoBeth Williams in the birdwatching comedy The Big Year. After a three-year hiatus, Martin returned in 2015 when he voiced a role in the animated film Home. In 2016, he played a supporting role in the war drama Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. In 1993, Martin wrote his first full-length play, Picasso at the Lapin Agile. The first reading of the play took place in Beverly Hills, California, at Steve Martin's home, with Tom Hanks reading the role of Pablo Picasso and Chris Sarandon reading the role of Albert Einstein. Following this, the play opened at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, and played from October 1993 to May 1994, then went on to run successfully in Los Angeles, New York City, and several other US cities.[40] In 2009, the school board in La Grande, Oregon, refused to allow the play to be performed after several parents complained about the content. In an open letter in the local Observer newspaper, Martin wrote: Throughout the 1990s, Martin wrote various pieces for The New Yorker. In 2002, he adapted the Carl Sternheim play The Underpants, which ran Off Broadway at Classic Stage Company, and in 2008 co-wrote and produced Traitor, starring Don Cheadle. He has also written the novellas Shopgirl (2000) and The Pleasure of My Company (2003), both more wry in tone than raucous.[42] A story of a 28-year-old woman behind the glove counter at the Saks Fifth Avenue department store in Beverly Hills, Shopgirl was made into a film starring Martin and Claire Danes.[42] The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005 and was featured at the Chicago International Film Festival and the Austin Film Festival before going into limited release in the US. In 2007, he published a memoir, Born Standing Up, which Time magazine named as one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 6, and praising it as \"a funny, moving, surprisingly frank memoir.\"[43] In 2010, he published the novel An Object of Beauty.[44] Martin's play Meteor Shower opened at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre in August 2016,[45] and went on to Connecticut's Long Wharf Theatre later the same year.[46] The play opened on Broadway at the Booth Theater on November 29, 2017. The cast features Amy Schumer, Laura Benanti, Jeremy Shamos and Keegan-Michael Key, with direction by Jerry Zaks.[47][48] Martin wrote the story for the Disney movie Magic Camp, which will be released in 2020. Beginning in 2019, Martin has collaborated with cartoonist Harry Bliss as a writer for the syndicated comic panel Bliss.[49][50] Martin hosted the Academy Awards solo in 2001 and 2003, and with Alec Baldwin in 2010.[51] In 2005, Martin co-hosted Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years, marking the park's anniversary. Disney continued to run the show until March 2009, which now[when?] plays in the lobby of Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. A fan of Monty Python, in 1989 Martin hosted the TV special, Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python, which was the final appearance of all six Python members together.[52][53] Martin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age. Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, Born Standing Up, that he used to take 33 rpm bluegrass records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing. Martin learned how to play the banjo with help from John McEuen, who later joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. McEuen's brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song \"King Tut\", being credited as \"The Toot Uncommons\" (as in Tutankhamun). The banjo was a staple of Martin's 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.[22] On the Comedy Is Not Pretty! album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled \"Drop Thumb Medley\", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, The Steve Martin Brothers (1981), featured one side of Martin's typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band. In 2001, he played banjo on Earl Scruggs's remake of \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\". The recording was the winner of the Best Country Instrumental Performance category at the Grammy Awards of 2002. In 2008, Martin appeared with the band, In the Minds of the Living, during a show in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[54] In 2009, Martin released his first all-music album, The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo with appearances from stars such as Dolly Parton.[55] The album won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album in 2010.[56] Nitty Gritty Dirt Band member John McEuen produced the album. Martin made his first appearance on The Grand Ole Opry on May 30, 2009.[57] In the American Idol season eight finals, he performed alongside Michael Sarver and Megan Joy in the song \"Pretty Flowers\". In June, Martin played banjo along with the Steep Canyon Rangers on A Prairie Home Companion and began a two-month U.S. tour with the Rangers in September, including appearances at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival, Carnegie Hall and Benaroya Hall in Seattle.[58][59] In November, they went on to play at the Royal Festival Hall in London with support from Mary Black.[60] In 2010, Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers appeared at the New Orleans Jazzfest, Merlefest Bluegrass Festival in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, at Bonnaroo Music Festival, at the ROMP[61] Bluegrass Festival in Owensboro, Kentucky, at the Red Butte Garden Concert series and on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland.[62][63] Martin performed \"Jubilation Day\" with the Steep Canyon Rangers on The Colbert Report on March 21, 2011, on Conan on May 3, 2011, and on BBC's The One Show on July 6, 2011.[64] Martin performed a song he wrote called \"Me and Paul Revere\"[65] in addition to two other songs on the lawn of the Capitol Building in Washington, DC, at the \"Capitol Fourth Celebration\" on July 4, 2011.[66] In 2011, Martin also narrated and appeared in the PBS documentary \"Give me the Banjo\" chronicling the history of the banjo in America.[67] Love Has Come for You, a collaboration album with Edie Brickell, was released in April 2013.[68] The two made musical guest appearances on talk shows, such as The View and Late Show with David Letterman, to promote the album.[69][70][71] The title track won the Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song.[72] Starting in May 2013, he began a tour with the Steep Canyon Rangers and Edie Brickell throughout the United States.[73] In 2015, Brickell and Martin released So Familiar as the second installment of their partnership.[74] Inspired by Love has Come for You, Martin and Brickell collaborated on his first musical, Bright Star. It is set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina in 1945\u201346, with flashbacks to 1923. The musical debuted on Broadway on March 24, 2016.[75] In 2017, Martin and Brickell appeared in the multi award-winning documentary film The American Epic Sessions directed by Bernard MacMahon. Recording live direct-to-disc on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s,[76] they performed a version of \u201cThe Coo Coo Bird\u201d a traditional song that Martin learned from the 1960s folk music group The Holy Modal Rounders.[77] The song was featured on the film soundtrack, Music from The American Epic Sessions released on June 9, 2017.[76] In 2010, Martin created the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass, an award established to reward artistry and bring greater visibility to bluegrass performers. The prize includes a US$50,000 cash award, a bronze sculpture created by the artist Eric Fischl, and a chance to perform with Martin on Late Show with David Letterman. Recipients include Noam Pikelny of the Punch Brothers band (2010),[78] Sammy Shelor of Lonesome River Band (2011),[79] Mark Johnson (2012),[80] Jens Kruger (2013),[81] Eddie Adcock (2014),[82] Danny Barnes (2015), Rhiannon Giddens (2016), Scott Vestal (2017), Kristin Scott Benson (2018), [83] and Victor Furtado (2019). [84] In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Martin was in a relationship with actress/singer/dancer Bernadette Peters; they co-starred in two films, The Jerk and Pennies from Heaven, during that time. Martin married actress Victoria Tennant on November 20, 1986; they divorced in 1994.[85] On July 28, 2007, after three years together, Martin married Anne Stringfield, a writer and former staffer for The New Yorker.[86] Former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey presided over the ceremony at Martin's Los Angeles home. Lorne Michaels, creator of Saturday Night Live, was best man.[86] Several of the guests, including close friends Tom Hanks, Eugene Levy, comedian and film director Carl Reiner, and magician/actor Ricky Jay, were not informed that a wedding ceremony would take place. Instead, they were told they were invited to a party and were surprised by the nuptials.[86] In December 2012, Martin became a father for the first time when Stringfield gave birth to a daughter.[87][88][89] Martin has been an avid art collector since 1968, when he bought a print by the Los Angeles artist Ed Ruscha.[90] In 2001, the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art presented a five-month exhibit of 28 items from Martin's collection, including works by Roy Lichtenstein, Pablo Picasso, David Hockney, and Edward Hopper, among others.[91] In 2006, he sold Hopper's Hotel Window (1955)[92] at Sotheby's for $26.8\u00a0million.[93] In 2015, working with two other curators, he organized a show, \"The Idea of North: The Paintings of Lawren Harris\", to introduce Americans to Canadian painter and Group of Seven co-founder Lawren Harris.[94] Investigators at Berlin's state criminal police office (LKA) think that Martin was a victim of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi. In July 2004, Martin purchased what he believed to be a 1915 work by the German-Dutch painter Heinrich Campendonk, Landschaft mit Pferden (Landscape with Horses), from a Paris gallery for what should have been a bargain price of around \u20ac700,000. Before the purchase, an expert authenticated the work and identified the painter's signature on a label attached to the back. Fifteen months later, the painting was sold at auction to a Swiss businesswoman for \u20ac500,000. Police believe the fake Campendonk originated from an invented art collection devised by a group of German swindlers caught in 2010. Skillfully forged paintings from this group were sold to French galleries like the one where Martin bought the forgery.[95] Martin has had tinnitus since filming a pistol-shooting scene for the film Three Amigos in 1986. He has been quoted as saying \"You just get used to it, or you go insane.\"[96][97] Martin stated his comedy influences which include, Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis and Woody Allen[98][99] Martin stated on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, that Jerry Seinfeld is one of my \"retro heroes\", \"a guy who came up behind me and is better than I am. I think he's fantastic, I love to listen to him, he almost puts me at peace I love to listen to him talk\".[100] Martin's offbeat, ironic, and deconstructive style of humor has influenced many comedians during his career. This includes Tina Fey, Steve Carell, Conan O'Brien, Jon Stewart[101] Stephen Colbert, Robert Smigel, Bo Burnham,[102] and Jordan Peele.[103]",

Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and later as a frequent guest on The Tonight Show. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from comedy, Martin has become a successful actor, as well as an author, playwright, pianist, and banjo player, eventually earning him Emmy, Grammy, and American Comedy awards, among other honors.\nIn 2004, Comedy Central ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics.[1] He was awarded an Honorary Academy Award at the Academy's 5th Annual Governors Awards in 2013.[2]\nWhile he has played banjo since an early age, and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career, he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s, acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo, recording, and touring with various bluegrass acts, including Earl Scruggs, with whom he won a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002. He released his first solo music album, The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo, in 2009, for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album.\nMartin was born on August 14, 1945,[3][4] in Waco, Texas,[5] the son of Mary Lee (n\u00e9e Stewart; 1913\u20132002) and Glenn Vernon Martin (1914\u20131997), a real estate salesman and aspiring actor.[6][7]\nMartin was raised in Inglewood, California, with sister Melinda Martin, and then later in Garden Grove, California, in a Baptist family.[8] Martin was a cheerleader of Garden Grove High School.[9] One of his earliest memories is of seeing his father, as an extra, serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place. During World War II, in the United Kingdom, Martin's father had appeared in a production of Our Town with Raymond Massey. Expressing his affection through gifts, like cars and bikes, Martin's father was stern, and not emotionally open to his son.[10] He was proud but critical, with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of hatred.[11]\nMartin's first job was at Disneyland, selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during his school's summer break. That lasted for three years (1955\u20131958). During his free time, he frequented the Main Street Magic shop, where tricks were demonstrated to patrons.[10]  While working at Disneyland, he was captured in the background of the home movie that was made into the short-subject film Disneyland Dream, incidentally becoming his first film appearance.  By 1960, he had mastered several magic tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the Magic shop in Fantasyland in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor Wally Boag,[12] frequently performing for tips.[13]\nIn his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could \"be described most accurately as an agnostic ... he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition\".[14]\nIn his early 20s, Martin dated Melissa Trumbo, daughter of novelist and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo.\nAfter high school, Martin attended Santa Ana College, taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and Garden Grove High School classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at Knott's Berry Farm.[10] Later, he met budding actress Stormie Sherk, and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherk's influence caused Martin to apply to the California State University, Long Beach, for enrollment with a major in philosophy.[10] Sherk enrolled at UCLA, about an hour's drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.[15]\nInspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor\u2013comedian. His time at college changed his life. \n Martin recalls reading a treatise on comedy that led him to think:\n Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology.\nIn 1967, Martin transferred to UCLA and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of The Dating Game. Martin began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices, and at twenty-one, he dropped out of college.[19]\nIn 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer Mason Williams.[20] Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an Emmy Award[21] in 1969, aged 23.[10] He also wrote for The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, and The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Martin's first TV appearance was on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1968. He says: \n During these years his roommates included comedian Gary Mule Deer and singer/guitarist Michael Johnson.[23] Martin opened for groups such as The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (who returned the favor by appearing in his 1980 television special All Commercials), The Carpenters, and Toto. He appeared at San Francisco's The Boarding House, among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on Van Dyke and Company in 1976.\nIn the mid-1970s, Martin made frequent appearances as a stand-up comedian on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,[22] and on  The Gong Show, HBO's On Location, The Muppet Show,[24] and NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL). SNL's audience jumped by a million viewers when he made guest appearances, and he was one of the show's most successful hosts.[10] Martin appeared on 27 Saturday Night Live shows and he guest-hosted 15 times, bested only in number of presentations by host Alec Baldwin (who has hosted 17 times as of February\u00a02017[update]). On the show, Martin popularized the air quotes gesture, which uses four fingers to make double quote marks in the air.[25] While on the show Martin became close with several of the cast members, including Gilda Radner. Radner died of ovarian cancer on May 20, 1989; a visibly shaken Martin hosted SNL that night and featured footage of himself and Radner together in a 1978 sketch.\nIn the 1970s, his TV appearances led to the release of comedy albums that went platinum.[10] The track \"Excuse Me\" on his first album, Let's Get Small (1977), helped establish a national catch phrase.[10] His next album, A Wild and Crazy Guy (1978), was an even bigger success, reaching the No. 2 spot on the U.S. sales chart, selling over a million copies. \"Just a wild and crazy guy\" became another of Martin's known catch phrases.[10] The album featured a character based on a series of Saturday Night Live sketches where Martin and Dan Aykroyd played the Festrunk Brothers; Yortuk and Georgi were bumbling Czechoslovak would-be playboys. The album ends with the song \"King Tut\", sung and written by Martin and backed by the \"Toot Uncommons\", members of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. It was later released as a single, reaching No. 17 on the U.S. charts in 1978 and selling over a million copies.[10][26] The song came out during the King Tut craze that accompanied the popular traveling exhibit of the Egyptian king's tomb artifacts. Both albums won Grammys for Best Comedy Recording in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Martin performed \"King Tut\" on the April 22, 1978 edition of SNL.\nDecades later, in 2012, The A.V. Club described Martin's unique style and its impact on audiences:\nOn his comedy albums, Martin's stand-up is self-referential and sometimes self-mocking. It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of \"happy feet\", banjo playing with balloon depictions of concepts like venereal disease, and the \"controversial\" kitten juggling (he is a master juggler; the \"kittens\" were stuffed animals). His style is off-kilter and ironic and sometimes pokes fun at stand-up comedy traditions, such as Martin opening his act (from A Wild and Crazy Guy) by saying: \n  Or: \"Hello, I'm Steve Martin, and I'll be out here in a minute.\"[25][28] In one comedy routine, used on the Comedy Is Not Pretty! album, Martin claimed that his real name was \"Gern Blanston\". The riff took on a life of its own. There is a Gern Blanston website, and for a time a rock band took the moniker as its name.[29]\nWith this kind of outstanding success, Martin's show soon required full sized stadiums for the audiences he was drawing. Concerned about his visibility in venues on such a scale, Martin began to wear a distinctive three piece white suit that became a trademark for his act.[30]\nMartin stopped doing stand-up comedy in 1981 to concentrate on movies and did not return for 35 years.[10] About this decision, he states: \nIn 2016, Martin made a rare return to comedy, opening for Jerry Seinfeld. He performed a 10-minute routine before turning the stage over to Seinfeld.[32]  Later in 2016 he returned to stand-up comedy, staging a national tour with Martin Short and the Steep Canyon Rangers, which yielded a 2018 Netflix comedy special, Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life.[33]\nBy the end of the 1970s, Martin had acquired the kind of following normally reserved for rock stars, with his tour appearances typically occurring at sold-out arenas filled with tens of thousands of screaming fans. But unknown to his audience, stand-up comedy was \"just an accident\" for him; his real goal was to get into film.[16]\nMartin had a small role in the 1972 film Another Nice Mess. His first substantial film appearance was in a short titled The Absent-Minded Waiter (1977). The seven-minute-long film, also featuring Buck Henry and Teri Garr, was written by and starred Martin. The film was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Short Film, Live Action. He made his first substantial feature film appearance in the musical Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, where he sang The Beatles' \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\". In 1979, Martin starred in the comedy film The Jerk, directed by Carl Reiner, and written by Martin, Michael Elias, and Carl Gottlieb. The film was a huge success, grossing over $100\u00a0million on a budget of approximately $4\u00a0million.[34]\nStanley Kubrick met with him to discuss the possibility of Martin starring in a screwball comedy version of Traumnovelle (Kubrick later changed his approach to the material, the result of which was 1999's Eyes Wide Shut). Martin was executive producer for Domestic Life, a prime-time television series starring friend Martin Mull, and a late-night series called Twilight Theater. It emboldened Martin to try his hand at his first serious film, Pennies from Heaven (1981), based on the 1978 BBC serial by Dennis Potter. He was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being typecast. To prepare for that film, Martin took acting lessons from director Herbert Ross and spent months learning how to tap dance. The film was a financial failure; Martin's comment at the time was \"I don't know what to blame, other than it's me and not a comedy.\"[35]\nMartin was in three more Reiner-directed comedies after The Jerk: Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid in 1982, The Man with Two Brains in 1983 and All of Me in 1984, his most critically acclaimed performance up to that point.[36][37]\nIn 1986, Martin joined fellow Saturday Night Live veterans Martin Short and Chevy Chase in \u00a1Three Amigos!, directed by John Landis, and written by Martin, Lorne Michaels, and singer-songwriter Randy Newman. It was originally entitled The Three Caballeros and Martin was to be teamed with Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. In 1986, Martin was in the movie musical film version of the hit Off-Broadway play Little Shop of Horrors (based on a famous B-movie), playing the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello. The film was the first of three films teaming Martin with Rick Moranis. In 1987, Martin joined comedian John Candy in the John Hughes movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles. That same year, Roxanne, the film adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac which Martin co-wrote, won him a Writers Guild of America Award. It also garnered recognition from Hollywood and the public that he was more than a comedian. In 1988, he performed in the Frank Oz film Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a remake of Bedtime Story, alongside Michael Caine. Also in 1988, he appeared at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center in a revival of Waiting for Godot directed by Mike Nichols.[38] He played Vladimir, with Robin Williams as Estragon and Bill Irwin as Lucky.\nMartin starred in the Ron Howard film Parenthood, with Rick Moranis in 1989. He later re-teamed with Moranis in the Mafia comedy My Blue Heaven (1990). In 1991, Martin starred in and wrote L.A. Story, a romantic comedy, in which the female lead was played by his then-wife Victoria Tennant. Martin also appeared in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon, in which he played the tightly wound Hollywood film producer, Davis, who was recovering from a traumatic robbery that left him injured, which was a more serious role for him. Martin also starred in a remake of the comedy Father of the Bride in 1991 (followed by a sequel in 1995) and in the 1992 comedy Housesitter, with Goldie Hawn and Dana Delany. In 1994, he starred in A Simple Twist of Fate; a film adaptation of Silas Marner.\nIn David Mamet's 1997 thriller The Spanish Prisoner, Martin played a darker role as a wealthy stranger who takes a suspicious interest in the work of a young businessman (Campbell Scott). He went on to star with Eddie Murphy in the 1999 comedy Bowfinger, which Martin also wrote.\nIn 1998, Martin guest starred with U2 in the 200th episode of The Simpsons titled \"Trash of the Titans\", providing the voice for sanitation commissioner Ray Patterson. In 1999, Martin and Hawn starred in a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon comedy, The Out-of-Towners. By 2003, Martin ranked fourth on the box office stars list, after starring in Bringing Down The House and Cheaper by the Dozen, each of which earned over $130\u00a0million at U.S. theaters. That same year, he also played the villainous Mr. Chairman in the animation/live action blend, Looney Tunes: Back in Action.\nIn 2005, Martin wrote and starred in Shopgirl, based on his own novella (2000), and starred in Cheaper by the Dozen 2. In 2006, he starred in the box office hit The Pink Panther, as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. He reprised the role in 2009's The Pink Panther 2. When combined, the two films grossed over $230\u00a0million at the box office. In Baby Mama (2008), Martin played the founder of a health food company, and in It's Complicated (2009), he played opposite Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. In 2009, an article in The Guardian listed Martin as one of the best actors never to receive an Oscar nomination.[39] In 2011, he appeared with Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and JoBeth Williams in the birdwatching comedy The Big Year. After a three-year hiatus, Martin returned in 2015 when he voiced a role in the animated film Home. In 2016, he played a supporting role in the war drama Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.\nIn 1993, Martin wrote his first full-length play, Picasso at the Lapin Agile. The first reading of the play took place in Beverly Hills, California, at Steve Martin's home, with Tom Hanks reading the role of Pablo Picasso and Chris Sarandon reading the role of Albert Einstein. Following this, the play opened at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, and played from October 1993 to May 1994, then went on to run successfully in Los Angeles, New York City, and several other US cities.[40] In 2009, the school board in La Grande, Oregon, refused to allow the play to be performed after several parents complained about the content. In an open letter in the local Observer newspaper, Martin wrote:  \nThroughout the 1990s, Martin wrote various pieces for The New Yorker. In 2002, he adapted the Carl Sternheim play The Underpants, which ran Off Broadway at Classic Stage Company, and in 2008 co-wrote and produced Traitor, starring Don Cheadle. He has also written the novellas Shopgirl (2000) and The Pleasure of My Company (2003), both more wry in tone than raucous.[42] A story of a 28-year-old woman behind the glove counter at the Saks Fifth Avenue department store in Beverly Hills, Shopgirl was made into a film starring Martin and Claire Danes.[42] The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005 and was featured at the Chicago International Film Festival and the Austin Film Festival before going into limited release in the US. In 2007, he published a memoir, Born Standing Up, which Time magazine named as one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 6, and praising it as \"a funny, moving, surprisingly frank memoir.\"[43] In 2010, he published the novel An Object of Beauty.[44]\nMartin's play Meteor Shower opened at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre in August 2016,[45] and went on to Connecticut's Long Wharf Theatre later the same year.[46] The play opened on Broadway at the Booth Theater on November 29, 2017. The cast features Amy Schumer, Laura Benanti, Jeremy Shamos and Keegan-Michael Key, with direction by Jerry Zaks.[47][48]\nMartin wrote the story for the Disney movie Magic Camp, which will be released in 2020.\nBeginning in 2019, Martin has collaborated with cartoonist Harry Bliss as a writer for the syndicated comic panel Bliss.[49][50]\nMartin hosted the Academy Awards solo in 2001 and 2003, and with Alec Baldwin in 2010.[51] In 2005, Martin co-hosted Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years, marking the park's anniversary. Disney continued to run the show until March 2009, which now[when?] plays in the lobby of Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.\nA fan of Monty Python, in 1989 Martin hosted the TV special, Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python, which was the final appearance of all six Python members together.[52][53]\nMartin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age. Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, Born Standing Up, that he used to take 33 rpm bluegrass records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing.\nMartin learned how to play the banjo with help from John McEuen, who later joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. McEuen's brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song \"King Tut\", being credited as \"The Toot Uncommons\" (as in Tutankhamun).\nThe banjo was a staple of Martin's 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.[22] On the Comedy Is Not Pretty! album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled \"Drop Thumb Medley\", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, The Steve Martin Brothers (1981), featured one side of Martin's typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band.\nIn 2001, he played banjo on Earl Scruggs's remake of \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\". The recording was the winner of the Best Country Instrumental Performance category at the Grammy Awards of 2002. In 2008, Martin appeared with the band, In the Minds of the Living, during a show in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[54]\nIn 2009, Martin released his first all-music album, The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo with appearances from stars such as Dolly Parton.[55] The album won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album in 2010.[56] Nitty Gritty Dirt Band member John McEuen produced the album.\nMartin made his first appearance on The Grand Ole Opry on May 30, 2009.[57] In the American Idol season eight finals, he performed alongside Michael Sarver and Megan Joy in the song \"Pretty Flowers\". In June, Martin played banjo along with the Steep Canyon Rangers on A Prairie Home Companion and began a two-month U.S. tour with the Rangers in September, including appearances at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival, Carnegie Hall and Benaroya Hall in Seattle.[58][59] In November, they went on to play at the Royal Festival Hall in London with support from Mary Black.[60] In 2010, Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers appeared at the New Orleans Jazzfest, Merlefest Bluegrass Festival in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, at Bonnaroo Music Festival, at the ROMP[61] Bluegrass Festival in Owensboro, Kentucky, at the Red Butte Garden Concert series and on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland.[62][63] Martin performed \"Jubilation Day\" with the Steep Canyon Rangers on The Colbert Report on March 21, 2011, on Conan on May 3, 2011, and on BBC's The One Show on July 6, 2011.[64] Martin performed a song he wrote called \"Me and Paul Revere\"[65] in addition to two other songs on the lawn of the Capitol Building in Washington, DC, at the \"Capitol Fourth Celebration\" on July 4, 2011.[66] In 2011, Martin also narrated and appeared in the PBS documentary \"Give me the Banjo\" chronicling the history of the banjo in America.[67]\nLove Has Come for You, a collaboration album with Edie Brickell, was released in April 2013.[68] The two made musical guest appearances on talk shows, such as The View and Late Show with David Letterman, to promote the album.[69][70][71]\nThe title track won the Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song.[72]\nStarting in May 2013, he began a tour with the Steep Canyon Rangers and Edie Brickell throughout the United States.[73] In 2015, Brickell and Martin released So Familiar as the second installment of their partnership.[74] Inspired by Love has Come for You, Martin and Brickell collaborated on his first musical, Bright Star. It is set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina in 1945\u201346, with flashbacks to 1923. The musical debuted on Broadway on March 24, 2016.[75]\nIn 2017, Martin and Brickell appeared in the multi award-winning documentary film The American Epic Sessions directed by Bernard MacMahon.  Recording live direct-to-disc on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s,[76] they performed a version of \u201cThe Coo Coo Bird\u201d a traditional song that Martin learned from the 1960s folk music group The Holy Modal Rounders.[77] The song was featured on the film soundtrack, Music from The American Epic Sessions released on June 9, 2017.[76]\nIn 2010, Martin created the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass, an award established to reward artistry and bring greater visibility to bluegrass performers. The prize includes a US$50,000 cash award, a bronze sculpture created by the artist Eric Fischl, and a chance to perform with Martin on Late Show with David Letterman. Recipients include Noam Pikelny of the Punch Brothers band (2010),[78] Sammy Shelor of Lonesome River Band (2011),[79] Mark Johnson (2012),[80] Jens Kruger (2013),[81] Eddie Adcock (2014),[82] Danny Barnes (2015), Rhiannon Giddens (2016), Scott Vestal (2017), Kristin Scott Benson (2018), [83] and Victor Furtado (2019). [84]\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Martin was in a relationship with actress/singer/dancer Bernadette Peters; they co-starred in two films, The Jerk and Pennies from Heaven, during that time.\nMartin married actress Victoria Tennant on November 20, 1986; they divorced in 1994.[85] On July 28, 2007, after three years together, Martin married Anne Stringfield, a writer and former staffer for The New Yorker.[86] Former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey presided over the ceremony at Martin's Los Angeles home. Lorne Michaels, creator of Saturday Night Live, was best man.[86] Several of the guests, including close friends Tom Hanks, Eugene Levy, comedian and film director Carl Reiner, and magician/actor Ricky Jay, were not informed that a wedding ceremony would take place. Instead, they were told they were invited to a party and were surprised by the nuptials.[86] In December 2012, Martin became a father for the first time when Stringfield gave birth to a daughter.[87][88][89]\nMartin has been an avid art collector since 1968, when he bought a print by the Los Angeles artist Ed Ruscha.[90] In 2001, the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art presented a five-month exhibit of 28 items from Martin's collection, including works by Roy Lichtenstein, Pablo Picasso, David Hockney, and Edward Hopper, among others.[91] In 2006, he sold Hopper's Hotel Window (1955)[92] at Sotheby's for $26.8\u00a0million.[93] In 2015, working with two other curators, he organized a show, \"The Idea of North: The Paintings of Lawren Harris\", to introduce Americans to Canadian painter and Group of Seven co-founder Lawren Harris.[94]\nInvestigators at Berlin's state criminal police office (LKA) think that Martin was a victim of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi. In July 2004, Martin purchased what he believed to be a 1915 work by the German-Dutch painter Heinrich Campendonk, Landschaft mit Pferden (Landscape with Horses), from a Paris gallery for what should have been a bargain price of around \u20ac700,000. Before the purchase, an expert authenticated the work and identified the painter's signature on a label attached to the back. Fifteen months later, the painting was sold at auction to a Swiss businesswoman for \u20ac500,000. Police believe the fake Campendonk originated from an invented art collection devised by a group of German swindlers caught in 2010. Skillfully forged paintings from this group were sold to French galleries like the one where Martin bought the forgery.[95]\nMartin has had tinnitus since filming a pistol-shooting scene for the film Three Amigos in 1986. He has been quoted as saying \"You just get used to it, or you go insane.\"[96][97]\nMartin stated his comedy influences which include, Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis and Woody Allen[98][99]\nMartin stated on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, that Jerry Seinfeld is one of my \"retro heroes\", \"a guy who came up behind me and is better than I am. I think he's fantastic, I love to listen to him, he almost puts me at peace I love to listen to him talk\".[100]\nMartin's offbeat, ironic, and deconstructive style of humor has influenced many comedians during his career. This includes Tina Fey, Steve Carell, Conan O'Brien, Jon Stewart[101] Stephen Colbert, Robert Smigel, Bo Burnham,[102] and Jordan Peele.[103]\n</body></html>"

He attended the London School of Economics, graduating with a bachelor's and eventually a master's degree in philosophy. Soros began his business career by taking various jobs at merchant banks in the United Kingdom and then the United States, before starting his first hedge fund, Double Eagle, in 1969. Profits from his first fund furnished the seed money to start Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed to Quantum Fund and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in assets under management, and as of 2011[update] it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.[12] Soros is known as \"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England\" because of his short sale of US$10 billion worth of pounds sterling, which made him a profit of $1\u00a0billion during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis.[13] Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated an application of Karl Popper's General Theory of Reflexivity to capital markets, which he claims renders a clear picture of asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.[14] Soros is a well-known supporter of progressive and liberal political causes, to which he dispenses donations through his foundation, the Open Society Foundations.[15] Between 1979 and 2011, he donated more than $11\u00a0billion to various philanthropic causes;[16][17] by 2017, his donations \"on civil initiatives to reduce poverty and increase transparency, and on scholarships and universities around the world\" totaled $12 billion.[18] He influenced the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s,[19] and provided one of Europe's largest higher education endowments to the Central European University in his Hungarian hometown.[20] His extensive funding of political causes has made him a \"bugaboo of European nationalists\".[21] Numerous American conservatives have promoted false claims that characterize Soros as a singularly dangerous \"puppet master\" behind a variety of alleged global plots, with The New York Times reporting that by 2018 these claims had \"moved from the fringes to the mainstream\" of Republican politics.[27] Conspiracy theories targeting Soros, who is of Jewish descent, have often been described as antisemitic.[28][29][30] Soros was born in Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots. Soros has wryly described his home as a Jewish antisemitic home.[31] His mother Erzs\u00e9bet (also known as Elizabeth) came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop. His father Tivadar (also known as Teodoro \u015cvarc) was a lawyer[32] and a well-known Esperanto-speaker[33] editing a literary magazine ('Literatura Mondo') who had also been a prisoner of war during and after World War I until he escaped from Russia and rejoined his family in Budapest.[34][35] The two married in 1924. In 1936, Soros's family changed their name from the German-Jewish Schwartz to Soros, as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic Hungary.[36][37] Tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning. In Hungarian, soros means \"next in line,\" or \"designated successor\"; in Esperanto it means \"will soar.\"[38][39][40] Soros was 13 years old in March 1944 when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary.[41] The Nazis barred Jewish children from attending school, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the Judenrat (\"Jewish Council\"), which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: \"The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper ... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, 'You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported'.\"[42][43] Soros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians. Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while inventorying a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family but also many other Hungarian Jews, and Soros later wrote that 1944 had been \"the happiest [year] of his life,\" for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.[44][45] In 1945, Soros survived the Siege of Budapest, in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city. In 1947, Soros immigrated to England and became a student at the London School of Economics.[46] While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter, and once received \u00a340 from a Quaker charity.[47] Soros would sometimes stand at Speakers' Corner lecturing about the virtues of internationalism in Esperanto, which he had learned from his father.[48] Soros took a Bachelor of Science in philosophy in 1951, and a Master of Science in philosophy in 1954, both from the London School of Economics.[49] In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, \"How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?\" Soros replied, \"Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank.\"[50] In 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank Singer & Friedlander of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.[51] In 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage trader for F. M. Mayer (1956\u201359). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the Coal and Steel Community, which later became the Common Market.[52] In 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to Wertheim & Co.. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy.[53] He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963. During this period, Soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of his tutor at the London School of Economics, Karl Popper. Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops. Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical \"virtuous\" or \"vicious\" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.[54][55] From 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the Interest Equalization Tax, which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966 he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies. In 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle hedge fund with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money.[56] It was based in Cura\u00e7ao, Dutch Antilles.[57] Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder's First Eagle fund established by Soros and that firm's chairman Henry H. Arnhold in 1967.[58] [59] In 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12\u00a0million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and Jim Rogers received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.[52] In 1970, Soros founded Soros Fund Management and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, Stanley Druckenmiller, Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.[60][61][62] In 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder. It was later renamed as the Quantum Fund, named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics. By that time the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.[51] By 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.[63] In July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1\u00a0billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5\u00a0billion family fortune, due to changes in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.[64] In 2013, the Quantum Fund made $5.5\u00a0billion, making it again the most successful hedge fund in history. Since its inception in 1973, the fund has generated $40\u00a0billion.[65] The fund announced in 2015 that it would inject $300 million to help finance the expansion of Fen Hotels, an Argentine hotel company. The funds will develop 5,000 rooms over the next three years throughout various Latin American countries.[66] Soros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling for months leading up to September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.[67] By September 16, 1992, the day of Black Wednesday, Soros's fund had sold short more than $10\u00a0billion in pounds,[60] profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries or float its currency. Finally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, devaluing the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1\u00a0billion.[68] He was dubbed \"the man who broke the Bank of England\".[69] The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the UK Treasury was \u00a33.4\u00a0billion.[70] Stanley Druckenmiller, who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: \"[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position.\"[71][72] On October 26, 1992, The New York Times quoted Soros as saying: \"Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10\u00a0billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15\u00a0billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell.\" Soros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas on February 5, 1996, in anticipation of selling them short. The markka had been put floating as a result of the early 1990s depression. The Bank of Finland and the Finnish Government commented at the time they believed that a \"conspiracy\" was impossible.[73] In 1997, during the Asian financial crisis, the prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad, accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for welcoming Myanmar as a member. Following on a history of antisemitic remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background (\"It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge\"[74]) and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis.[75] In 1998's The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered Soros explained his role in the crisis as follows: The financial crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity ... By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline\u2014we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)[76]In 1999, economist Paul Krugman was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets. [N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is 'Soroi'.[77]In an interview regarding the late-2000s recession, Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been \"some kind of an ideological excess.\" In Soros's view, the markets' moods\u2014a \"mood\" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at reality\u2014\"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles.\"[78] In reaction to the late-2000s recession, he founded the Institute for New Economic Thinking in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system. In 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges P\u00e9bereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac).[79] Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9. In 1989, the Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward.[80] However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006,[81] although it reduced the penalty to \u20ac940,000.[81] Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge[82] and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover.[81] In December 2006, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds, including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing.[83] On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal.[79] In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4\u20133 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.[84] Soros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war. Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by World War II.[85] They divorced in 1983. They had three children: In 1983, George Soros married Susan Weber. They divorced in 2005. They have two children: In 2008, Soros met Tamiko Bolton;[91] they married September 21, 2013.[92] Bolton is the daughter of a nurse and a retired naval commander, Robert Bolton. She was raised in California, earned an MBA from the University of Miami, and runs an Internet-based dietary supplement and vitamin-sales company.[93] Soros's older brother Paul Soros, a private investor and philanthropist, died on June 15, 2013.[94] Also an engineer, Paul headed Soros Associates and established the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for Young Americans.[95][96] He was married to Daisy Soros (n\u00e9e Schlenger), who, like her husband, was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant,[97] and with whom he had two sons, Peter and Jeffrey.[98] Peter Soros was married to the former Flora Fraser, a daughter of Lady Antonia Fraser and the late Sir Hugh Fraser and a stepdaughter of the late 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter. Fraser and Soros separated in 2009.[99] In 2005, Soros was a minority partner in a group that tried to buy the Washington Nationals, a Major League baseball team. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that they might move to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption if Soros bought the team.[100] In 2008, Soros's name was associated with AS Roma, an Italian association football team, but the club was not sold. Soros was a financial backer of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to Major League Soccer club D.C. United when the league was founded in 1995, but the group lost these rights in 2000.[101] On August 21, 2012, BBC reported SEC filings showing Soros acquired roughly a 1.9 percent stake in English football club Manchester United through the purchase of 3.1\u00a0million of the club's Class-A shares.[102] Soros had not been a large donor to U.S. political causes until the 2004 presidential election, but according to the Center for Responsive Politics, during the 2003\u20132004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 Groups (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 527). The groups aimed to defeat President George W. Bush. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called Democracy Alliance, which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.[103] In August 2009, Soros donated $35\u00a0million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140\u00a0million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the 2009 federal recovery act.[47] Soros was an initial donor to the Center for American Progress, and he continues to support the organization through the Open Society Foundations. In October 2011, a Reuters story, \"Soros: Not a funder of Wall Street Protests,\" was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined \"Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?\" with a lede stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement \"may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros].\" Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and Adbusters' co-founder Kalle Lasn both saying that Adbusters\u2014the reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protests\u2014had never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that \"indirect financial links\" existed between the two as late as 2010.[104][105] On September 27, 2012, Soros announced that he was donating $1\u00a0million to the super PAC backing President Barack Obama's reelection Priorities USA Action.[106] In October 2013, Soros donated $25,000 to Ready for Hillary, becoming a co-chairman of the super PAC's national finance committee.[107] In June 2015, he donated $1 million to the Super PAC Priorities USA Action, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. He donated $6 million to the PAC in December 2015 and $2.5 million in August 2016.[108] According to Waldemar A. Nielsen, an authority on American philanthropy,[109] \"[Soros] has undertaken ... nothing less than to open up the once-closed communist societies of Eastern Europe to a free flow of ideas and scientific knowledge from the outside world.\"[110] From 1979, as an advocate of 'open societies', Soros financially supported dissidents including Poland's Solidarity movement, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union.[111] In 1984, he founded his first Open Society Institute in Hungary with a budget of $3\u00a0million.[112] Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros' funding has played an important role in the former Soviet sphere. A 2017 study found that a grant program by George Soros which awarded funding to over 28,000 scientists in the former Soviet sphere shortly after the end of the Soviet Union \"more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting [beneficial] impacts.\"[113] His funding of pro-democratic programs in Georgia was considered by Georgian nationalists to be crucial to the success of the Rose Revolution, although Soros has said that his role has been \"greatly exaggerated.\"[114] Alexander Lomaia, Secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, is a former Executive Director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2.5\u00a0million.[115] Former Georgian foreign minister Salom\u00e9 Zourabichvili wrote that institutions like the Soros Foundation were the cradle of democratization and that all the NGOs that gravitated around the Soros Foundation undeniably carried the revolution. She opines that after the revolution the Soros Foundation and the NGOs were integrated into power.[116] Some Soros-backed pro-democracy initiatives have been banned in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.[117] Ercis Kurtulus, head of the Social Transparency Movement Association (TSHD) in Turkey, said in an interview that \"Soros carried out his will in Ukraine and Georgia by using these NGOs ... Last year Russia passed a special law prohibiting NGOs from taking money from foreigners. I think this should be banned in Turkey as well.\"[118] In 1997, Soros closed his foundation in Belarus after it was fined $3\u00a0million by the government for \"tax and currency violations.\" According to The New York Times, the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West and in Russia for his efforts to control the Belarus Soros Foundation and other independent NGOs and to suppress civil and human rights. Soros called the fines part of a campaign to \"destroy independent society.\"[119] In June 2009, Soros donated $100\u00a0million to Central Europe and Eastern Europe to counter the impact of the economic crisis on the poor, voluntary groups and non-government organisations.[120] Since 2012 the Hungarian Fidesz government labelled George Soros as enemy of the state due to his humanitarian and political involvement in the European refugee crisis. The government has attacked OSF, the international civil support foundation created by George Soros, and tried to revoke the licence of Central European University (Budapest) (which failed mostly due to significant public outrage[121]). In response Soros called the government \"a mafia state\".[122] As the 2018 election period started the government introduced public posters with the photo of Soros,[123] to create hostility in the general public towards him, using statements such as \"Soros wants millions of migrants to live in Hungary\", and \"Soros wants to dismantle the border fence\". The government also prepared a three-part law plan called \"Stop Soros package\" (which followed other various law changes[124] in the same year which hindered workings of several international NGOs in Hungary), which would include various steps against NGOs doing volunteer work related to the refugee crisis. In March 2017, six US senators sent a letter to then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson[125] asking that he look into several grants the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have given to groups funded by \"left-wing\" Soros. According to the Heritage Foundation, the letter expressed specific concern about Soros' influence on Macedonian politics, a concern which has also been expressed by members of the conservative Macedonian government.[126] In the same context, the conservative group Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State and USAID compelling them to release records regarding $5 million transferred from USAID to Soros' Open Society branch in Macedonia. The suit alleges that the money was deliberately used to destabilize the Macedonian government,[127] where the Open Society Foundation claims its activities were aimed at ethnic reconciliation.[128] In January 2017, the \"Stop Operation Soros\" (SOS) initiative was launched in Macedonia. SOS seeks to present \"questions and answers about the way Soros operates worldwide\" and invites citizens to contribute to the research. In a press conference held during the same month, Nenad Mircevski, one of the founders of the initiative, stated that SOS would work towards the \"de-Soros-ization\" of Macedonia.[129][130] On May 16, 2018, Soros' Open Society Foundations announced they would move its office from Budapest to Berlin, blaming the move on an \"increasingly repressive\" environment in Hungary.[131][132][133] The Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa is a Soros-affiliated organization.[134] In November 2005, Soros said: \"My personal opinion is there's no alternative but to give Kosovo independence.\"[135] Soros has helped fund the non-profit group called Independent Diplomat.[136] It represented Kosovo, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (under military occupation by Turkey since 1974),[137] Somaliland and the Polisario Front of Western Sahara.[136] Soros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28g) of marijuana in the state. Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine.[138] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation.[139] Soros donated $1.4\u00a0million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.[140] In October 2010, Soros donated $1\u00a0million to support California's Proposition 19.[141] According to remarks in an interview in October 2009, it is Soros' opinion that marijuana is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students. He himself has not used marijuana for years.[142] Soros has been a major financier of the Drug Policy Alliance \u2013 an organization that promotes cannabis legalization \u2013 with roughly $4\u00a0million in annual contributions from one of his foundations.[143] The Project on Death in America, active from 1994 to 2003,[144] was one of the Open Society Institute's projects, which sought to \"understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement.\"[145] In 1994, Soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother, a member of the right-to-die advocacy organization Hemlock Society, commit suicide.[146] In the same speech, he also endorsed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act,[147] proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign.[148] Soros' philanthropy and support for progressive causes has made him the object of a large number of conspiracy theories, most of them originating from the political right.[149][150] Veronika Bondarenko, writing for Business Insider said that \"For two decades, some have seen Soros as a kind of puppet master secretly controlling the global economy and politics.\"[151] The New York Times describes the allegations as moving \"from the dark corners of the internet and talk radio\" to \"the very center of the political debate\" by 2018.[152] Soros has become a magnet for such theories, with opponents claiming that he is behind such diverse events as the 2017 Women's March, the fact-checking website Snopes, the gun-control activism engaged in by the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,[153][154][155] the October 2018 immigrant caravans, and the protests against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.[152][156] Conservatives, meanwhile, picked up on the thread in the late 2000s, spearheaded by Fox News. Bill O'Reilly gave an almost ten-minute monologue on Soros in 2007, calling him an \"extremist\" and claiming he was \"off-the-charts dangerous\".[154] Breitbart News, according to the London Times journalist, David Aaronovitch, in promoting East European nationalism, has regularly published articles blaming Soros for anything of which it disapproves.[157] Soros' opposition to Brexit (in the United Kingdom) led to a front page on the British Conservative supporting newspaper, The Daily Telegraph in February 2018, which was accused of antisemitism for claiming he was involved in a supposed \"secret plot\" for the country's voters to reverse their decision to leave the European Union.[28] While the Telegraph did not mention Soros is Jewish, his opposition to Britain leaving the European Union had been reported elsewhere in less conspiratorial terms.[29] Stephen Pollard, editor of The Jewish Chronicle, said on Twitter: \"The point is that language matters so much and this is exactly the language being used by antisemites here and abroad\".[30][158] In October 2019, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Soros of being the \"funder-in-chief\" of the Remain campaign, and was subsequently accused of anti-Semitism by opposition MPs.[159] After being ousted from office in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal of 2016, Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson accused Soros of having bankrolled a conspiracy to remove him from power.[160][161] It was later pointed out that Soros himself had also been implicated in the Panama Papers, casting doubt on the prime minister's theory.[162] Right-wing figures such as Alex Jones, Donald Trump Jr., James Woods, Dinesh D'Souza, Louie Gohmert, and Larry Klayman have spread a false conspiracy theory, which has been described as anti-Semitic, that Soros was a Nazi collaborator who turned in other Jews and stole their property.[163][164][165][166] Soros was a child during World War II who had to hide from the Hungarian government during Nazi occupation.[173] In October 2018, Soros was accused of funding a Central American migrant caravan heading toward America.[174][175][176] The theory that Soros was somehow causing Central American migration at the southern US border apparently dates back to late March 2018, however.[177] The October 2018 strain of the theory has been described to combine anti-semitism, anti-immigrant sentiment and \"the specter of powerful foreign agents controlling major world events in pursuit of a hidden agenda\", connecting Soros and other wealthy individuals of Jewish faith or background to the October caravan.[177] Both Cesar Sayoc, the perpetrator of the October 2018 attempted bombings of prominent Democrats, and Robert Bowers, the perpetrator of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, referred to this conspiracy theory on social media before their crimes.[178][179] In November 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan denounced Soros while speaking about Turkey's political purges, saying: \"The person who financed terrorists during the Gezi incidents is already in prison. And who is behind him? The famous Hungarian Jew Soros. This is a man who assigns people to divide nations and shatter them.\"[180] In November 2019, attorney Joseph diGenova, who is known for promoting conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice and the FBI,[189] asserted without evidence that Soros \"controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department\" and \"also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NGOs -- work with NGOs. That was very evident in Ukraine.\"[190] A pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros's Katonah, New York home on October 22, 2018, as part of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts. The package was discovered by a caretaker,[191] who removed it and notified authorities. It was photographed and exploded by the FBI, which launched an investigation.[192][193] For several days afterward, similar bombs were mailed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and several other Democrats and liberals.[194] On October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc was arrested in Aventura, Florida, on suspicion of mailing the bombs.[195] Soros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations. Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.[55] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:[55] A recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.[55] Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses. Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans \u2013 the value of the houses \u2013 had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively). Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still. This was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards. The concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,[196] but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology.[197] The notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of Complexity economics, as developed at the Santa Fe Institute, although Soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.[198][199][200][201] Although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"Open Society\" in the past were from Communism and Fascism (as discussed in The Open Society and Its Enemies by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism. He has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.[202] Soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism.[203] Soros's book The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a \"superbubble\" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states: I have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in The Alchemy of Finance (in 1987), then in The Crisis of Global Capitalism (in 1998), and now in this book. So it's three books predicting disaster. [After] the boy cried wolf three times ... the wolf really came.[204] He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong. I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.[204] In February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.[205] \"We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom.\" In January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a financial crisis akin to 2008 based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking Chinese yuan. China has a major adjustment problem. I would say it amounts to a crisis. When I look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in 2008.[206][207] When asked about what he thought about Israel, in The New Yorker, Soros replied: \"I don't deny the Jews to a right to a national existence \u2013 but I don't want anything to do with it.\"[208] According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of \"challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies\" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy.[209] He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies[210][211][212] including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.[210] Speaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of George W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism. Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the \"Jewish financiers\" who, in antisemitic terms, \"ruled the world by proxy\", suggested that if we change the direction of those policies, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of what's out there, and \"blamed the victim\" when holding Jews responsible for antisemitism. Jewish philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified, \"George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be.\"[213] Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by \"giv[ing] up on the tribalness\".[214] In a subsequent article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized that I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.[215]In 2017, Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz filed a $10 million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the government of Guinea to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to \"long-standing animus toward the state of Israel\".[216][217][218] Steinmetz claims that Soros engaged in a \"smear\" campaign against him and his companies and blames Soros for scrutiny of him by American, Israeli, Swiss, and Guinean authorities.[219] Soros called Steinmetz's suit \"frivolous and entirely false\" and said that it was \"a desperate PR stunt meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions\".[220] During an award ceremony for Imre Kert\u00e9sz, Soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming \"perpetrators of violence\", suggesting that this model explained Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians, which led to walkouts and Soros being booed.[221] In July 2017, in Hungary a billboard campaign backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n which was considered to be anti-semitic by the country's Jewish groups vilified Soros as an enemy of the state using the slogan \"Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh\".[222] The campaign was estimated to have cost 5.7bn forints (then US$21 million).[223] According to the Israeli ambassador the campaign \"evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear\", a reference to Hungary's role in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust.[224] Lydia Gall of Human Rights Watch asserted that it was reminiscent of Nazi posters during the Second World War featuring \"'the laughing Jew'\".[225] Orb\u00e1n and his government's representative said they had a \"zero tolerance\" of antisemitism explaining the posters were aiming to persuade voters Soros was a \"national security risk\".[222] Hours later, in an apparent attempt to ally Israel with Hungary, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a \"clarification\", denouncing Soros, stating that he \"continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself\".[226] Soros' son Alexander said in an interview that his father cares about Israel, and that he \"would like to see Israel in Yitzhak Rabin's image. His views are more or less the common views in Meretz and in the Labor Party.\" According to Alexander, Soros supports a two-state solution. The younger Soros recounts that after his bar mitzvah in 1998, his father told him: \"If you're serious about being Jewish, you might want to consider immigrating to Israel.\"[227] On November 11, 2003, in an interview with The Washington Post, Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the \"central focus of my life\" and \"a matter of life and death\". He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush \"if someone guaranteed it\".[228][229] Soros gave $3\u00a0million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5\u00a0million to MoveOn.org, and $20\u00a0million[230] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech: Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush[231] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The online transcript to this speech received many hits after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as \"factcheck.com\" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site.[232] His 2003 book, The Bubble of American Supremacy[233], was a forthright critique of the Bush administration's \"War on Terror\" as misconceived and counterproductive, and a polemic against the re-election of Bush. He explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the self-reinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices. When Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in The Age of Fallibility that \"the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States\", he responded that \"it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world ... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims.\"[234] Soros described Donald Trump as a con man.[235] Soros expects Trump to fail because Soros believes Trump's ideas are self-contradictory. Soros said in 2017 he believed Trump was preparing for a trade war and expected financial markets to do badly.[236] In October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled \"As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite\",[237] in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis. The letter was co-signed by Javier Solana, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Andrew Duff, Emma Bonino, Massimo D'Alema, Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga. Soros criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his handling of the European migrant crisis in 2015: \"His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.\"[238] Soros expected that Brexit would fail and the Premiership of Theresa May would last only a short time.[236] Soros is opposed to Brexit and donated \u00a3400,000 to the anti-Brexit 'Best for Britain' group.[239] Soros also hosted a dinner for Conservative donors at his London home to encourage them to follow his lead. Soros's Open Society Foundations also donated a total of \u00a3303,000 to two pro-EU organizations, the European Movement UK and Scientists for EU, and a center-right think-tank, Bright Blue.[240] In 2018, Soros highlighted that Europe faces major challenges, in particular, that related to immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the political block.[241] He holds that Europe is facing an existential crisis, in view of the rise of populism, the refugee crisis and a growing rift between Europe and the United States.[242] Soros has also stated that \"the euro has many unresolved problems\" which \"must not be allowed to destroy the European Union\". He advocated replacing the notion of a multi-speed Europe by the aim of a \"multi-track Europe\" that would allow member states a wider variety of choices.[243] In view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a Marshall Plan for Africa (see Marshall Plan), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration.[241][243] Soros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, \"China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests ... They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well.\" Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, \"Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States.\"[244] In July 2015, Soros stated that a \"strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict\".[245] In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that \"[a] hard landing is practically unavoidable\". Chinese state media responded by stating \"Soros' challenge to the RMB and Hong Kong dollar are doomed to fail, without any doubt.\"[246] In January 2019, Soros used his annual speech at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, to label Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of China, as the \"most dangerous opponent of open societies\", saying: \"China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced\". He also urged the United States not to allow the Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE to dominate the 5G telecommunications market as this would present an \"unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world\".[247][248] Soros also criticized the newest form of China's Big Brother-like system of mass surveillance called the Social Credit System, saying it would give Xi, \"total control\" over the people of China.\"[249] In May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: \"I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now.\"[250] In January 2015, Soros said that \"Europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from Russia.\" He also urged Western countries to expand economic sanctions against Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.[251] In January 2015, Soros called on the European Union to give $50\u00a0billion of bailout money to Ukraine.[252] In July 2015, Soros stated that Putin's annexation of Crimea was a challenge to the \"prevailing world order,\" specifically the European Union. He hypothesized that Putin wants to \"destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support.\"[245] In November 2015, Russia banned the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI)-- two pro-democracy charities founded by Soros\u2014stating they posed a \"threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state.\"[253][254] In January 2016, 53 books related to Soros's \"Renewal of Humanitarian Education\" program were withdrawn at the Vorkuta Mining and Economic College in the Komi Republic, with 427 additional books seized for shredding. A Russian intergovernmental letter released in December 2015 stated that Soros's charities were \"forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives, alien to Russian ideology, popular\". Most of these books were published with funds donated by Soros's charities.[255][256] As of February\u00a02017[update], Forbes magazine listed Soros as the 29th richest person in the world,[257] the world's richest hedge-fund manager, and 19th on its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans,[258] with a net worth estimated at $25.2\u00a0billion.[259] This was after Soros had lost almost $1 billion in the weeks after the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president in 2016.[260] Soros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa,[111] and began funding dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain. Soros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent democratization in the post-Soviet states. These efforts, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the Open Society Foundations (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland). As of 2003, PBS estimated that he had given away a total of $4\u00a0billion.[82] The OSI says it has spent about $500\u00a0million annually in recent years. In 2003, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker wrote in the foreword of Soros's book The Alchemy of Finance: George Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game. The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become \"open societies\", open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but\u2014more important\u2014tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.[261]Time magazine in 2007 cited two specific projects\u2014$100\u00a0million toward Internet infrastructure for regional Russian universities, and $50\u00a0million for the Millennium Promise to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa\u2014noting that Soros had given $742\u00a0million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7\u00a0billion.[262] Other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, and Transparency International. Soros also pledged an endowment of \u20ac420\u00a0million to the Central European University (CEU). According to National Review Online[263] the Open Society Institute gave $20,000 in September 2002 to the Defense Committee of Lynne Stewart, the lawyer who has defended controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to 21/3 years in prison for \"providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy\" via a press conference for a client. An OSI spokeswoman said \"it appeared to us at that time that there was a right-to-counsel issue worthy of our support\" but claimed later requests for support were declined.[264] In September 2006, Soros pledged $50\u00a0million to the Millennium Promise, led by economist Jeffrey Sachs to provide educational, agricultural, and medical aid to help villages in Africa enduring poverty. The New York Times termed this endeavor a \"departure\" for Soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government, but Soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance.[265] Soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in Hungary (1984\u201389)[19] and provided a substantial endowment to Central European University in Budapest.[266] The Open Society Foundations has active programs in more than 60 countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately $600\u00a0million a year.[3][267] On October 17, 2017, it was announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion to the Open Society Foundations.[268] In October 2018, Soros donated $2 million to the Wikimedia Foundation via the Wikimedia Endowment program.[269] Soros received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social Research (New York), the University of Oxford in 1980, the Corvinus University of Budapest, and Yale University in 1991. He received an honorary degree in economics from the University of Bologna in 1995.[270] In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A. Cohen.[271] In January 2014, Soros was ranked number 1 in LCH Investments list of top 20 managers having posting gains of almost $42 billion since the launch of his Quantum Endowment Fund in 1973.[272] In July 2017, Soros was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.[273] Soros was the Financial Times Person of the Year for 2018, with the FT describing him as \"a standard bearer for liberal democracy, an idea under siege from populists\".[274] In April 2019 Soros was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Courage.[275] In his acceptance address Soros said: \"In my native Hungary, the government of [Prime Minister] Viktor Orb\u00e1n has turned me into the super villain of an alleged plot to destroy the supposed Christian identity of the Hungarian nation... [I] donate the prize money associated with this award to the Hungarian Spectrum, an online English-language publication that provides daily updates on Hungarian politics. It renders an important service by exposing to the world [in English] what Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is telling his own people [in Hungarian]. It [Hungarian Spectrum] deserves to be better known and supported.\"[276] George Soros has written many books, articles, and papers on economics, finance, stock trading, and geopolitics.",

He attended the London School of Economics, graduating with a bachelor's and eventually a master's degree in philosophy. Soros began his business career by taking various jobs at merchant banks in the United Kingdom and then the United States, before starting his first hedge fund, Double Eagle, in 1969. Profits from his first fund furnished the seed money to start Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed to Quantum Fund and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in assets under management, and as of 2011[update] it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.[12]\nSoros is known as \"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England\" because of his short sale of US$10 billion worth of pounds sterling, which made him a profit of $1\u00a0billion during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis.[13] Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated an application of Karl Popper's General Theory of Reflexivity to capital markets, which he claims renders a clear picture of asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.[14]\nSoros is a well-known supporter of progressive and liberal political causes, to which he dispenses donations through his foundation, the Open Society Foundations.[15] Between 1979 and 2011, he donated more than $11\u00a0billion to various philanthropic causes;[16][17] by 2017, his donations \"on civil initiatives to reduce poverty and increase transparency, and on scholarships and universities around the world\" totaled $12 billion.[18] He influenced the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s,[19] and provided one of Europe's largest higher education endowments to the Central European University in his Hungarian hometown.[20] His extensive funding of political causes has made him a \"bugaboo of European nationalists\".[21] Numerous American conservatives have promoted false claims that characterize Soros as a singularly dangerous \"puppet master\" behind a variety of alleged global plots, with The New York Times reporting that by 2018 these claims had \"moved from the fringes to the mainstream\" of Republican politics.[27] Conspiracy theories targeting Soros, who is of Jewish descent, have often been described as antisemitic.[28][29][30]\nSoros was born in Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots. Soros has wryly described his home as a Jewish antisemitic home.[31] His mother Erzs\u00e9bet (also known as Elizabeth) came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop. His father Tivadar (also known as Teodoro \u015cvarc) was a lawyer[32] and a well-known Esperanto-speaker[33] editing a literary magazine ('Literatura Mondo') who had also been a prisoner of war during and after World War I until he escaped from Russia and rejoined his family in Budapest.[34][35] The two married in 1924. In 1936, Soros's family changed their name from the German-Jewish Schwartz to Soros, as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic Hungary.[36][37] Tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning. In Hungarian, soros means \"next in line,\" or \"designated successor\"; in Esperanto it means \"will soar.\"[38][39][40]\nSoros was 13 years old in March 1944 when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary.[41] The Nazis barred Jewish children from attending school, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the Judenrat (\"Jewish Council\"), which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: \"The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper ...  I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, 'You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported'.\"[42][43]\nSoros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians. Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while inventorying a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family but also many other Hungarian Jews, and Soros later wrote that 1944 had been \"the happiest [year] of his life,\" for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.[44][45] In 1945, Soros survived the Siege of Budapest, in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city.\nIn 1947, Soros immigrated to England and became a student at the London School of Economics.[46] While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter, and once received \u00a340 from a Quaker charity.[47] Soros would sometimes stand at Speakers' Corner lecturing about the virtues of internationalism in Esperanto, which he had learned from his father.[48]\nSoros took a Bachelor of Science in philosophy in 1951, and a Master of Science in philosophy in 1954, both from the London School of Economics.[49]\nIn a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, \"How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?\" Soros replied, \"Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank.\"[50]\nIn 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.[51]\nIn 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage trader for F. M. Mayer (1956\u201359). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the Coal and Steel Community, which later became the Common Market.[52]\nIn 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to Wertheim &amp; Co.. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy.[53] He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963.\nDuring this period, Soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of his tutor at the London School of Economics, Karl Popper. Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops.  Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical \"virtuous\" or \"vicious\" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.[54][55]\nFrom 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the Interest Equalization Tax, which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966 he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies.\nIn 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle hedge fund with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money.[56] It was based in Cura\u00e7ao, Dutch Antilles.[57] Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder's First Eagle fund established by Soros and that firm's chairman Henry H. Arnhold in 1967.[58]\n[59]\nIn 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12\u00a0million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and Jim Rogers received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.[52]\nIn 1970, Soros founded Soros Fund Management and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, Stanley Druckenmiller, Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.[60][61][62]\nIn 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder.\nIt was later renamed as the Quantum Fund, named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics. By that time the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.[51]\nBy 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.[63]\nIn July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1\u00a0billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5\u00a0billion family fortune, due to changes in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.[64]\nIn 2013, the Quantum Fund made $5.5\u00a0billion, making it again the most successful hedge fund in history. Since its inception in 1973, the fund has generated $40\u00a0billion.[65]\nThe fund announced in 2015 that it would inject $300 million to help finance the expansion of Fen Hotels, an Argentine hotel company. The funds will develop 5,000 rooms over the next three years throughout various Latin American countries.[66]\nSoros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling for months leading up to September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.[67]\nBy September 16, 1992, the day of Black Wednesday, Soros's fund had sold short more than $10\u00a0billion in pounds,[60] profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries or float its currency.\nFinally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, devaluing the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1\u00a0billion.[68] He was dubbed \"the man who broke the Bank of England\".[69] The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the UK Treasury was \u00a33.4\u00a0billion.[70] Stanley Druckenmiller, who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: \"[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position.\"[71][72]\nOn October 26, 1992, The New York Times quoted Soros as saying: \"Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10\u00a0billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15\u00a0billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell.\"\nSoros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas on February 5, 1996, in anticipation of selling them short. The markka had been put floating as a result of the early 1990s depression. The Bank of Finland and the Finnish Government commented at the time they believed that a \"conspiracy\" was impossible.[73]\nIn 1997, during the Asian financial crisis, the prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad, accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for welcoming Myanmar as a member. Following on a history of antisemitic remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background (\"It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge\"[74]) and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis.[75] In 1998's The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered Soros explained his role in the crisis as follows:\nThe financial crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity ... By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline\u2014we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)[76]In 1999, economist Paul Krugman was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets.\n[N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is 'Soroi'.[77]In an interview regarding the late-2000s recession, Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been \"some kind of an ideological excess.\" In Soros's view, the markets' moods\u2014a \"mood\" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at reality\u2014\"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles.\"[78]\nIn reaction to the late-2000s recession, he founded the Institute for New Economic Thinking in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system.\nIn 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges P\u00e9bereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac).[79] Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9.\nIn 1989, the Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward.[80] However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006,[81] although it reduced the penalty to \u20ac940,000.[81]\nSoros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge[82] and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover.[81] In December 2006, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds, including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing.[83] On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal.[79] In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4\u20133 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.[84]\nSoros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war. Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by World War II.[85] They divorced in 1983. They had three children:\nIn 1983, George Soros married Susan Weber. They divorced in 2005. They have two children:\nIn 2008, Soros met Tamiko Bolton;[91] they married September 21, 2013.[92] Bolton is the daughter of a nurse and a retired naval commander, Robert Bolton. She was raised in California, earned an MBA from the University of Miami, and runs an Internet-based dietary supplement and vitamin-sales company.[93]\nSoros's older brother Paul Soros, a private investor and philanthropist, died on June 15, 2013.[94] Also an engineer, Paul headed Soros Associates and established the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for Young Americans.[95][96] He was married to Daisy Soros (n\u00e9e Schlenger), who, like her husband, was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant,[97] and with whom he had two sons, Peter and Jeffrey.[98] Peter Soros was married to the former Flora Fraser, a daughter of Lady Antonia Fraser and the late Sir Hugh Fraser and a stepdaughter of the late 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter. Fraser and Soros separated in 2009.[99]\nIn 2005, Soros was a minority partner in a group that tried to buy the Washington Nationals, a Major League baseball team. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that they might move to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption if Soros bought the team.[100] In 2008, Soros's name was associated with AS Roma, an Italian association football team, but the club was not sold. Soros was a financial backer of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to Major League Soccer club D.C. United when the league was founded in 1995, but the group lost these rights in 2000.[101] On August 21, 2012, BBC reported SEC filings showing Soros acquired roughly a 1.9 percent stake in English football club Manchester United through the purchase of 3.1\u00a0million of the club's Class-A shares.[102]\nSoros had not been a large donor to U.S. political causes until the 2004 presidential election, but according to the Center for Responsive Politics, during the 2003\u20132004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 Groups (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 527). The groups aimed to defeat President George W. Bush. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called Democracy Alliance, which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.[103]\nIn August 2009, Soros donated $35\u00a0million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140\u00a0million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the 2009 federal recovery act.[47]\nSoros was an initial donor to the Center for American Progress, and he continues to support the organization through the Open Society Foundations.\nIn October 2011, a Reuters story, \"Soros: Not a funder of Wall Street Protests,\" was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined \"Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?\" with a lede stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement \"may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros].\" Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and Adbusters' co-founder Kalle Lasn both saying that Adbusters\u2014the reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protests\u2014had never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that \"indirect financial links\" existed between the two as late as 2010.[104][105]\nOn September 27, 2012, Soros announced that he was donating $1\u00a0million to the super PAC backing President Barack Obama's reelection Priorities USA Action.[106]\nIn October 2013, Soros donated $25,000 to Ready for Hillary, becoming a co-chairman of the super PAC's national finance committee.[107] In June 2015, he donated $1 million to the Super PAC Priorities USA Action, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. He donated $6 million to the PAC in December 2015 and $2.5 million in August 2016.[108]\nAccording to Waldemar A. Nielsen, an authority on American philanthropy,[109] \"[Soros] has undertaken ... nothing less than to open up the once-closed communist societies of Eastern Europe to a free flow of ideas and scientific knowledge from the outside world.\"[110] From 1979, as an advocate of 'open societies', Soros financially supported dissidents including Poland's Solidarity movement, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union.[111] In 1984, he founded his first Open Society Institute in Hungary with a budget of $3\u00a0million.[112]\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros' funding has played an important role in the former Soviet sphere. A 2017 study found that a grant program by George Soros which awarded funding to over 28,000 scientists in the former Soviet sphere shortly after the end of the Soviet Union \"more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting [beneficial] impacts.\"[113] His funding of pro-democratic programs in Georgia was considered by Georgian nationalists to be crucial to the success of the Rose Revolution, although Soros has said that his role has been \"greatly exaggerated.\"[114] Alexander Lomaia, Secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, is a former Executive Director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2.5\u00a0million.[115]\nFormer Georgian foreign minister Salom\u00e9 Zourabichvili wrote that institutions like the Soros Foundation were the cradle of democratization and that all the NGOs that gravitated around the Soros Foundation undeniably carried the revolution. She opines that after the revolution the Soros Foundation and the NGOs were integrated into power.[116]\nSome Soros-backed pro-democracy initiatives have been banned in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.[117] Ercis Kurtulus, head of the Social Transparency Movement Association (TSHD) in Turkey, said in an interview that  \"Soros carried out his will in Ukraine and Georgia by using these NGOs ... Last year Russia passed a special law prohibiting NGOs from taking money from foreigners. I think this should be banned in Turkey as well.\"[118] In 1997, Soros closed his foundation in Belarus after it was fined $3\u00a0million by the government for \"tax and currency violations.\" According to The New York Times, the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West and in Russia for his efforts to control the Belarus Soros Foundation and other independent NGOs and to suppress civil and human rights. Soros called the fines part of a campaign to \"destroy independent society.\"[119]\nIn June 2009, Soros donated $100\u00a0million to Central Europe and Eastern Europe to counter the impact of the economic crisis on the poor, voluntary groups and non-government organisations.[120]\nSince 2012 the Hungarian Fidesz government labelled George Soros as enemy of the state due to his humanitarian and political involvement in the European refugee crisis. The government has attacked OSF, the international civil support foundation created by George Soros, and tried to revoke the licence of Central European University (Budapest) (which failed mostly due to significant public outrage[121]). In response Soros called the government \"a mafia state\".[122]\nAs the 2018 election period started the government introduced public posters with the photo of Soros,[123] to create hostility in the general public towards him, using statements such as \"Soros wants millions of migrants to live in Hungary\", and \"Soros wants to dismantle the border fence\". The government also prepared a three-part law plan called \"Stop Soros package\" (which followed other various law changes[124] in the same year which hindered workings of several international NGOs in Hungary), which would include various steps against NGOs doing volunteer work related to the refugee crisis.\nIn March 2017, six US senators sent a letter to then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson[125] asking that he look into several grants the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have given to groups funded by \"left-wing\" Soros. According to the Heritage Foundation, the letter expressed specific concern about Soros' influence on Macedonian politics, a concern which has also been expressed by members of the conservative Macedonian government.[126] In the same context, the conservative group Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State and USAID compelling them to release records regarding $5 million transferred from USAID to Soros' Open Society branch in Macedonia. The suit alleges that the money was deliberately used to destabilize the Macedonian government,[127] where the Open Society Foundation claims its activities were aimed at ethnic reconciliation.[128]\nIn January 2017, the \"Stop Operation Soros\" (SOS) initiative was launched in Macedonia. SOS seeks to present \"questions and answers about the way Soros operates worldwide\" and invites citizens to contribute to the research. In a press conference held during the same month, Nenad Mircevski, one of the founders of the initiative, stated that SOS would work towards the \"de-Soros-ization\" of Macedonia.[129][130]\nOn May 16, 2018, Soros' Open Society Foundations announced they would move its office from Budapest to Berlin, blaming the move on an \"increasingly repressive\" environment in Hungary.[131][132][133]\nThe Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa is a Soros-affiliated organization.[134]\nIn November 2005, Soros said: \"My personal opinion is there's no alternative but to give Kosovo independence.\"[135] Soros has helped fund the non-profit group called Independent Diplomat.[136] It represented Kosovo, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (under military occupation by Turkey since 1974),[137] Somaliland and the Polisario Front of Western Sahara.[136]\nSoros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28g) of marijuana in the state.  Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine.[138] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation.[139] Soros donated $1.4\u00a0million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.[140]\nIn October 2010, Soros donated $1\u00a0million to support California's Proposition 19.[141]\nAccording to remarks in an interview in October 2009, it is Soros' opinion that marijuana is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students. He himself has not used marijuana for years.[142] Soros has been a major financier of the Drug Policy Alliance \u2013 an organization that promotes cannabis legalization \u2013 with roughly $4\u00a0million in annual contributions from one of his foundations.[143]\nThe Project on Death in America, active from 1994 to 2003,[144] was one of the Open Society Institute's projects, which sought to \"understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement.\"[145] In 1994, Soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother, a member of the right-to-die advocacy organization Hemlock Society, commit suicide.[146] In the same speech, he also endorsed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act,[147] proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign.[148]\n\nSoros' philanthropy and support for progressive causes has made him the object of a large number of conspiracy theories, most of them originating from the political right.[149][150] Veronika Bondarenko, writing for Business Insider said that \"For two decades, some have seen Soros as a kind of puppet master secretly controlling the global economy and politics.\"[151] The New York Times describes the allegations as moving \"from the dark corners of the internet and talk radio\" to \"the very center of the political debate\" by 2018.[152]\nSoros has become a magnet for such theories, with opponents claiming that he is behind such diverse events as the 2017 Women's March, the fact-checking website Snopes, the gun-control activism engaged in by the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,[153][154][155] the October 2018 immigrant caravans, and the protests against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.[152][156]\nConservatives, meanwhile, picked up on the thread in the late 2000s, spearheaded by Fox News. Bill O'Reilly gave an almost ten-minute monologue on Soros in 2007, calling him an \"extremist\" and claiming he was \"off-the-charts dangerous\".[154] Breitbart News, according to the London Times journalist, David Aaronovitch, in promoting East European nationalism, has regularly published articles blaming Soros for anything of which it disapproves.[157]\nSoros' opposition to Brexit (in the United Kingdom) led to a front page on the British Conservative supporting newspaper, The Daily Telegraph in February 2018, which was accused of antisemitism for claiming he was involved in a supposed \"secret plot\" for the country's voters to reverse their decision to leave the European Union.[28] While the Telegraph did not mention Soros is Jewish, his opposition to Britain leaving the European Union had been reported elsewhere in less conspiratorial terms.[29] Stephen Pollard, editor of The Jewish Chronicle, said on Twitter: \"The point is that language matters so much and this is exactly the language being used by antisemites here and abroad\".[30][158] In October 2019, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Soros of being the \"funder-in-chief\" of the Remain campaign, and was subsequently accused of anti-Semitism by opposition MPs.[159]\nAfter being ousted from office in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal of 2016, Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson accused Soros of having bankrolled a conspiracy to remove him from power.[160][161] It was later pointed out that Soros himself had also been implicated in the Panama Papers, casting doubt on the prime minister's theory.[162]\nRight-wing figures such as Alex Jones, Donald Trump Jr., James Woods, Dinesh D'Souza, Louie Gohmert, and Larry Klayman have spread a false conspiracy theory, which has been described as anti-Semitic, that Soros was a Nazi collaborator who turned in other Jews and stole their property.[163][164][165][166] Soros was a child during World War II who had to hide from the Hungarian government during Nazi occupation.[173]\nIn October 2018, Soros was accused of funding a Central American migrant caravan heading toward America.[174][175][176] The theory that Soros was somehow causing Central American migration at the southern US border apparently dates back to late March 2018, however.[177] The October 2018 strain of the theory has been described to combine anti-semitism, anti-immigrant sentiment and \"the specter of powerful foreign agents controlling major world events in pursuit of a hidden agenda\", connecting Soros and other wealthy individuals of Jewish faith or background to the October caravan.[177] Both Cesar Sayoc, the perpetrator of the October 2018 attempted bombings of prominent Democrats, and Robert Bowers, the perpetrator of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, referred to this conspiracy theory on social media before their crimes.[178][179]\nIn November 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan denounced Soros while speaking about Turkey's political purges, saying: \"The person who financed terrorists during the Gezi incidents is already in prison. And who is behind him? The famous Hungarian Jew Soros. This is a man who assigns people to divide nations and shatter them.\"[180]\nIn November 2019, attorney Joseph diGenova, who is known for promoting conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice and the FBI,[189] asserted without evidence that Soros \"controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department\" and \"also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NGOs -- work with NGOs. That was very evident in Ukraine.\"[190]\nA pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros's Katonah, New York home on October 22, 2018, as part of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts. The package was discovered by a caretaker,[191] who removed it and notified authorities. It was photographed and exploded by the FBI, which launched an investigation.[192][193] For several days afterward, similar bombs were mailed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and several other Democrats and liberals.[194]\nOn October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc was arrested in Aventura, Florida, on suspicion of mailing the bombs.[195]\nSoros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations.  Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.[55] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:[55]\nA recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.[55] Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses.  More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses.  Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans \u2013 the value of the houses \u2013 had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively).  Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.\nThis was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.\nThe concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,[196] but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology.[197]\nThe notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of Complexity economics, as developed at the Santa Fe Institute, although Soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.[198][199][200][201]\nAlthough the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"Open Society\" in the past were from Communism and Fascism (as discussed in The Open Society and Its Enemies by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism.\nHe has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.[202]\nSoros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism.[203]\nSoros's book The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a \"superbubble\" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states:\nI have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in The Alchemy of Finance (in 1987), then in The Crisis of Global Capitalism (in 1998), and now in this book. So it's three books predicting disaster. [After] the boy cried wolf three times ... the wolf really came.[204]\nHe ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong.\nI'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight.  When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.[204]\nIn February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.[205] \"We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom.\"\nIn January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a financial crisis akin to 2008 based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking Chinese yuan.\nChina has a major adjustment problem. I would say it amounts to a crisis. When I look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in 2008.[206][207]\nWhen asked about what he thought about Israel, in The New Yorker, Soros replied: \"I don't deny the Jews to a right to a national existence \u2013 but I don't want anything to do with it.\"[208] According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of \"challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies\" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy.[209] He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies[210][211][212] including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.[210]\nSpeaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of George W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism.  Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the \"Jewish financiers\" who, in antisemitic terms, \"ruled the world by proxy\", suggested that if we change the direction of those policies, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of what's out there, and \"blamed the victim\" when holding Jews responsible for antisemitism.  Jewish philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified, \"George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be.\"[213]  Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by \"giv[ing] up on the tribalness\".[214]\nIn a subsequent article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized that\nI do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.[215]In 2017, Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz filed a $10 million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the government of Guinea to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to \"long-standing animus toward the state of Israel\".[216][217][218] Steinmetz claims that Soros engaged in a \"smear\" campaign against him and his companies and blames Soros for scrutiny of him by American, Israeli, Swiss, and Guinean authorities.[219] Soros called Steinmetz's suit \"frivolous and entirely false\" and said that it was \"a desperate PR stunt meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions\".[220]\nDuring an award ceremony for Imre Kert\u00e9sz, Soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming \"perpetrators of violence\", suggesting that this model explained Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians, which led to walkouts and Soros being booed.[221]\nIn July 2017, in Hungary a billboard campaign backed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n which was considered to be anti-semitic by the country's Jewish groups vilified Soros as an enemy of the state using the slogan \"Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh\".[222] The campaign was estimated to have cost 5.7bn forints (then US$21 million).[223] According to the Israeli ambassador the campaign \"evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear\", a reference to Hungary's role in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust.[224] Lydia Gall of Human Rights Watch asserted that it was reminiscent of Nazi posters during the Second World War featuring \"'the laughing Jew'\".[225] Orb\u00e1n and his government's representative said they had a \"zero tolerance\" of antisemitism explaining the posters were aiming to persuade voters Soros was a \"national security risk\".[222]\nHours later, in an apparent attempt to ally Israel with Hungary, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a \"clarification\", denouncing Soros, stating that he \"continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself\".[226]\nSoros' son Alexander said in an interview that his father cares about Israel, and that he \"would like to see Israel in Yitzhak Rabin's image. His views are more or less the common views in Meretz and in the Labor Party.\" According to Alexander, Soros supports a two-state solution. The younger Soros recounts that after his bar mitzvah in 1998, his father told him: \"If you're serious about being Jewish, you might want to consider immigrating to Israel.\"[227]\nOn November 11, 2003, in an interview with The Washington Post, Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the \"central focus of my life\" and \"a matter of life and death\". He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush \"if someone guaranteed it\".[228][229] Soros gave $3\u00a0million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5\u00a0million to MoveOn.org, and $20\u00a0million[230] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech: Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush[231] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The online transcript to this speech received many hits after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as \"factcheck.com\" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site.[232]\nHis 2003 book, The Bubble of American Supremacy[233], was a forthright critique of the Bush administration's \"War on Terror\" as misconceived and counterproductive, and a polemic against the re-election of Bush. He explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the self-reinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices.\nWhen Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in The Age of Fallibility that \"the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States\", he responded that \"it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world ... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims.\"[234]\nSoros described Donald Trump as a con man.[235] Soros expects Trump to fail because Soros believes Trump's ideas are self-contradictory. Soros said in 2017 he believed Trump was preparing for a trade war and expected financial markets to do badly.[236]\nIn October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled \"As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite\",[237] in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis. The letter was co-signed by Javier Solana, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Andrew Duff, Emma Bonino, Massimo D'Alema, Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga.\nSoros criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his handling of the European migrant crisis in 2015: \"His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.\"[238]\nSoros expected that Brexit would fail and the Premiership of Theresa May would last only a short time.[236] Soros is opposed to Brexit and donated \u00a3400,000 to the anti-Brexit 'Best for Britain' group.[239] Soros also hosted a dinner for Conservative donors at his London home to encourage them to follow his lead. Soros's Open Society Foundations also donated a total of \u00a3303,000 to two pro-EU organizations, the European Movement UK and Scientists for EU, and a center-right think-tank, Bright Blue.[240]\nIn 2018, Soros highlighted that Europe faces major challenges, in particular, that related to immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the political block.[241] He holds that Europe is facing an existential crisis, in view of the rise of populism, the refugee crisis and a growing rift between Europe and the United States.[242] Soros has also stated that \"the euro has many unresolved problems\" which \"must not be allowed to destroy the European Union\". He advocated replacing the notion of a multi-speed Europe by the aim of a \"multi-track Europe\" that would allow member states a wider variety of choices.[243]\nIn view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a Marshall Plan for Africa (see Marshall Plan), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration.[241][243]\nSoros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, \"China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests ... They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well.\"  Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, \"Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States.\"[244] In July 2015, Soros stated that a \"strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict\".[245]  In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that \"[a] hard landing is practically unavoidable\".  Chinese state media responded by stating \"Soros' challenge to the RMB and Hong Kong dollar are doomed to fail, without any doubt.\"[246]\nIn January 2019, Soros used his annual speech at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, to label Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of China, as the \"most dangerous opponent of open societies\", saying: \"China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced\". He also urged the United States not to allow the Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE to dominate the 5G telecommunications market as this would present an \"unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world\".[247][248] Soros also criticized the newest form of China's Big Brother-like system of mass surveillance called the Social Credit System, saying it would give Xi, \"total control\" over the people of China.\"[249]\nIn May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: \"I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now.\"[250]\nIn January 2015, Soros said that \"Europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from Russia.\" He also urged Western countries to expand economic sanctions against Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.[251]\nIn January 2015, Soros called on the European Union to give $50\u00a0billion of bailout money to Ukraine.[252]\nIn July 2015, Soros stated that Putin's annexation of Crimea was a challenge to the \"prevailing world order,\" specifically the European Union. He hypothesized that Putin wants to \"destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support.\"[245] In November 2015, Russia banned the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI)-- two pro-democracy charities founded by Soros\u2014stating they posed a \"threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state.\"[253][254] In January 2016, 53 books related to Soros's \"Renewal of Humanitarian Education\" program were withdrawn at the Vorkuta Mining and Economic College in the Komi Republic, with 427 additional books seized for shredding. A Russian intergovernmental letter released in December 2015 stated that Soros's charities were \"forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives, alien to Russian ideology, popular\". Most of these books were published with funds donated by Soros's charities.[255][256]\nAs of February\u00a02017[update], Forbes magazine listed Soros as the 29th richest person in the world,[257] the world's richest hedge-fund manager, and 19th on its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans,[258] with a net worth estimated at $25.2\u00a0billion.[259] This was after Soros had lost almost $1 billion in the weeks after the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president in 2016.[260]\nSoros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa,[111] and began funding dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain.\nSoros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent democratization in the post-Soviet states. These efforts, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the Open Society Foundations (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland). As of 2003, PBS estimated that he had given away a total of $4\u00a0billion.[82] The OSI says it has spent about $500\u00a0million annually in recent years.\nIn 2003, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker wrote in the foreword of Soros's book The Alchemy of Finance:\nGeorge Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game. The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become \"open societies\", open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but\u2014more important\u2014tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.[261]Time magazine in 2007 cited two specific projects\u2014$100\u00a0million toward Internet infrastructure for regional Russian universities, and $50\u00a0million for the Millennium Promise to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa\u2014noting that Soros had given $742\u00a0million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7\u00a0billion.[262]\nOther notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, and Transparency International. Soros also pledged an endowment of \u20ac420\u00a0million to the Central European University (CEU).\nAccording to National Review Online[263] the Open Society Institute gave $20,000 in September 2002 to the Defense Committee of Lynne Stewart, the lawyer who has defended controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to 21/3 years in prison for \"providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy\" via a press conference for a client. An OSI spokeswoman said \"it appeared to us at that time that there was a right-to-counsel issue worthy of our support\" but claimed later requests for support were declined.[264]\nIn September 2006, Soros pledged $50\u00a0million to the Millennium Promise, led by economist Jeffrey Sachs to provide educational, agricultural, and medical aid to help villages in Africa enduring poverty. The New York Times termed this endeavor a \"departure\" for Soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government, but Soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance.[265]\nSoros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in Hungary (1984\u201389)[19] and provided a substantial endowment to Central European University in Budapest.[266] The Open Society Foundations has active programs in more than 60 countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately $600\u00a0million a year.[3][267]\nOn October 17, 2017, it was announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion to the Open Society Foundations.[268]\nIn October 2018, Soros donated $2 million to the Wikimedia Foundation via the Wikimedia Endowment program.[269]\nSoros received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social Research (New York), the University of Oxford in 1980, the Corvinus University of Budapest, and Yale University in 1991. He received an honorary degree in economics from the University of Bologna in 1995.[270]\nIn 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A. Cohen.[271]\nIn January 2014, Soros was ranked number 1 in LCH Investments list of top 20 managers having posting gains of almost $42 billion since the launch of his Quantum Endowment Fund in 1973.[272]\nIn July 2017, Soros was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.[273]\nSoros was the Financial Times Person of the Year for 2018, with the FT describing him as \"a standard bearer for liberal democracy, an idea under siege from populists\".[274]\nIn April 2019 Soros was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Courage.[275] In his acceptance address Soros said: \"In my native Hungary, the government of [Prime Minister] Viktor Orb\u00e1n has turned me into the super villain of an alleged plot to destroy the supposed Christian identity of the Hungarian nation... [I] donate the prize money associated with this award to the Hungarian Spectrum, an online English-language publication that provides daily updates on Hungarian politics. It renders an important service by exposing to the world [in English] what Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is telling his own people [in Hungarian]. It [Hungarian Spectrum] deserves to be better known and supported.\"[276]\nGeorge Soros has written many books, articles, and papers on economics, finance, stock trading, and geopolitics.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nNatasha Bianca Lyonne Braunstein (/li\u02c8o\u028an/;[1] born April 4, 1979[2]), known professionally as Natasha Lyonne, is an American actress, writer, producer and director. She is best known for her portrayal of Nicky Nichols in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black (2013\u20132019), for which she received an Emmy Award nomination in 2014, and for her role as Jessica in the American Pie film series (1999\u20132012). She is also a co-creator, executive producer and writer for the 2019 Netflix series Russian Doll, on which she plays the lead role of Nadia Vulvokov. Lyonne has appeared in over 50 films, including Everyone Says I Love You (1996), Slums of Beverly Hills (1998), Detroit Rock City, But I'm a Cheerleader (both 1999), Scary Movie 2, The Grey Zone, Kate & Leopold (all 2001), Party Monster, Die Mommie Die!

Lyonne was born in New York City,[1] the daughter of Ivette Buchinger[1] and Aaron Braunstein, a boxing promoter, race car driver and radio host,[3] distantly related to cartoonist Al Jaffee.[1] Lyonne's parents were from Orthodox Jewish families, and she was raised Orthodox.[4][5][6] Her mother was born in Paris, France,[7] to Hungarian Jewish parents who were Holocaust survivors.[8][9][10][11][12] Lyonne has darkly joked that her family consists of \"my father's side, Flatbush, and my mother's side, Auschwitz.\"[1] Her grandmother Ella[13] came from a large family, but only she and her two sisters and two brothers survived, which Lyonne credits to their blond hair and blue eyes.[1] Lyonne's grandfather, Morris Buchinger, operated a watch company in Los Angeles. During the war, he hid in Budapest as a non-Jew working in a leather factory.[1] Lyonne lived the first eight years of her life in Great Neck, New York.[8][14] She and her parents then moved to Israel, where Lyonne spent a year and a half. During her stay in Israel, Lyonne participated in the production of the Israeli children's film April Fool, which began her interest in acting.[4][15] Her parents divorced, and Lyonne and her older brother Adam returned to America with their mother.[8] After moving back to New York City, Lyonne attended The Rabbi Joseph H. Lookstein Upper School of Ramaz, a private Jewish school,[16] where Lyonne said she was a scholarship kid who took honors Talmud classes and read Aramaic. She was expelled for selling marijuana at school. Lyonne grew up on the Upper East Side, where she felt she was an outcast.[1] Her mother then moved their family to Miami, where Lyonne attended Miami Country Day School.[17][18] She never graduated from high school; she left before her senior year to attend a film program at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Her high school graduation depended on completing her first year at Tisch, but she left the program because she could not pay the tuition.[6] She attended New York University for a short time, studying film and philosophy.[14] Lyonne was estranged from her father, who was a Democratic candidate for City Council for the sixth District of Manhattan in 2013,[3][19] and lived on the Upper West Side until his death in October 2014.[20] Lyonne has said she is not close to her mother and has essentially lived independently of her family since age 16.[4] As a young child, Lyonne was signed by the Ford Modeling Agency.[21] At the age of six, she was cast as Opal on Pee-wee's Playhouse, followed by film appearances in Heartburn, A Man Called Sarge, and Dennis the Menace. On working as a very young child actor, Lyonne said: \"I didn't have the best parents. I don't think they are bad people. Even if they were ready to have children, it is kind of a wacky idea to put your child in business at six years old.\"[7] At 16 years of age, Lyonne was cast in the Woody Allen-directed Everyone Says I Love You (1996). This led to appearances in a variety of films over the next 10 years, including starring roles in the independent features Slums of Beverly Hills (1998), for which she received two Teen Choice Award nominations,[22] and But I'm a Cheerleader (1999). During this time, she appeared as Jessica in the highly successful teen comedy American Pie (1999), reprising the role in two of its sequels. Lyonne's other films during this period included Detroit Rock City, Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby (both 1999), Scary Movie 2, The Grey Zone, Kate & Leopold (all 2001), Party Monster (2003), and Blade: Trinity (2004). Lyonne's subsequent film appearances include All About Evil (2010), 4:44 Last Day on Earth (2011), Girl Most Likely, Loitering with Intent, Sleeping with Other People, Hello My Name Is Doris, Addicted to Fresno, #Horror, Yoga Hosers, Antibirth, The Intervention, and Handsome: A Netflix Mystery Movie. In 2019, she will appear alongside Lucas Hedges and Shia LaBeouf in LaBeouf's autobiographical film Honey Boy.[23]Lyonne made her New York stage debut in the award-winning New Group production of Mike Leigh's Two Thousand Years.[4][24] She was part of the original cast of the award-winning Love, Loss, and What I Wore, a play by Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron, based on the book by Ilene Beckerman.[25] In 2010 Lyonne received positive reviews for her performance in Kim Rosenstock's comedy Tigers Be Still at the Roundabout Theatre Company: \"a thorough delight in the flat-out funniest role, the grief-crazed Grace, so deeply immersed in self-pity that she has cast aside any attempts at decorum\".[26][27] In 2011, Lyonne starred opposite Ethan Hawke and Ann Dowd in New Group's production of Tommy Nohilly's Blood From a Stone.[28][29] The following year, she participated in New Group's benefit performance of Women Behind Bars.[30] On working in the theater: \"There's something about theater that squashes the self-critical voices because you have to be in the moment. I'm glad that I didn't do this before I was ready, before I was capable of showing up every day. That is not a skill set I had before\".[29] Lyonne has made guest appearances on the series Grounded for Life, Weeds, New Girl, Will & Grace, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Since 2013 she has appeared as Nicky Nichols on the critically acclaimed Netflix series Orange Is the New Black. The role is Lyonne's first television job as a series regular.[31] She received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2014,[32] and has twice been awarded the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, along with her co-stars. In 2014 Lyonne was cast in Amy Poehler's NBC comedy pilot Old Soul, directed by David Wain.[33] In 2016 she began voicing the character Smoky Quartz on the Cartoon Network show Steven Universe. She has also appeared as various characters on IFC's sketch comedy series Portlandia. In 2018 she voiced the character Gaz Digzy on Adult Swim's comedy series Ballmastrz: 9009. More recently she has voiced characters on The Simpsons and Netflix's Big Mouth. Her performance in the 2019 Netflix series Russian Doll has been praised as \"astonishing\".[34] Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone called it \"brilliant\".[35] In 2017, Lyonne was approached by Kenzo's creative directors Carol Lim and Humberto Leon to direct the 5th installment in their short film series. For this, her directorial debut, she began writing a script with Maya Rudolph in mind to star.[36] The surrealist short film was titled Cabiria, Charity, Chastity and starred Rudolph, Fred Armisen, Greta Lee, Leslie Odom Jr., and Macaulay Culkin.[37] In September 2017, Lyonne's project Russian Doll was given an 8-episode straight to series order by Netflix.[38] The comedy, co-created and executive produced by Lyonne, Amy Poehler, and Leslye Headland, premiered on February 1, 2019.[39] Lyonne has multiple roles in the series. She is credited as the lead actress and is one of the executive producers of the series with directorial and writing credits.[40] Lyonne also directed an episode of Orange Is the New Black for its seventh and final season, as well as an episode of Hulu's Shrill titled \"WAHAM\". [41] Lyonne lives in New York City.[42] When she was 18, Lyonne used the paycheck from her work on Everyone Says I Love You to buy a small apartment near Gramercy Park.[8] At this time, she skipped her senior year of high school to attend NYU Tisch as a double major in film and philosophy. Lyonne has been in a relationship with Saturday Night Live alumnus Fred Armisen since 2014.[43][44] During the early 2000s, Lyonne experienced legal problems and was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol,[45] and for incidents involving her neighbors.[46] In 2005 she was evicted by her landlord, actor Michael Rapaport, following complaints by other tenants about her behavior.[47] In 2005, Lyonne was admitted to Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan under a pseudonym, suffering from hepatitis C, a heart infection, and a collapsed lung; she was also undergoing methadone treatment for heroin addiction.[48] In January 2006 a warrant was issued for her arrest after she missed a court hearing relating to her prior problems. Her lawyer said an emergency had arisen but did not give details. Later that year Lyonne was admitted to a drug and alcohol treatment center, and she appeared in court afterward. A judge sentenced her to conditional discharge.[4] Lyonne underwent open-heart surgery in 2012 to correct valvular damage caused by her heart infection,[49] which could have resulted in sudden death if untreated.[50] She recovered from the surgery, and discussed her past health problems on The Rosie Show in March 2012.[51]",

She is best known for her portrayal of Nicky Nichols in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black (2013\u20132019), for which she received an Emmy Award nomination in 2014, and for her role as Jessica in the American Pie film series (1999\u20132012). She is also a co-creator, executive producer and writer for the 2019 Netflix series Russian Doll, on which she plays the lead role of Nadia Vulvokov.\nLyonne has appeared in over 50 films, including Everyone Says I Love You (1996), Slums of Beverly Hills (1998), Detroit Rock City, But I'm a Cheerleader (both 1999), Scary Movie 2, The Grey Zone, Kate &amp; Leopold (all 2001), Party Monster, Die Mommie Die!

During the war, he hid in Budapest as a non-Jew working in a leather factory.[1]\nLyonne lived the first eight years of her life in Great Neck, New York.[8][14] She and her parents then moved to Israel, where Lyonne spent a year and a half. During her stay in Israel, Lyonne participated in the production of the Israeli children's film April Fool, which began her interest in acting.[4][15] Her parents divorced, and Lyonne and her older brother Adam returned to America with their mother.[8] After moving back to New York City, Lyonne attended The Rabbi Joseph H. Lookstein Upper School of Ramaz, a private Jewish school,[16] where Lyonne said she was a scholarship kid who took honors Talmud classes and read Aramaic. She was expelled for selling marijuana at school. Lyonne grew up on the Upper East Side, where she felt she was an outcast.[1] Her mother then moved their family to Miami, where Lyonne attended Miami Country Day School.[17][18] She never graduated from high school; she left before her senior year to attend a film program at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Her high school graduation depended on completing her first year at Tisch, but she left the program because she could not pay the tuition.[6]\nShe attended New York University for a short time, studying film and philosophy.[14]\nLyonne was estranged from her father, who was a Democratic candidate for City Council for the sixth District of Manhattan in 2013,[3][19] and lived on the Upper West Side until his death in October 2014.[20] Lyonne has said she is not close to her mother and has essentially lived independently of her family since age 16.[4]\nAs a young child, Lyonne was signed by the Ford Modeling Agency.[21] At the age of six, she was cast as Opal on Pee-wee's Playhouse, followed by film appearances in Heartburn, A Man Called Sarge, and Dennis the Menace. On working as a very young child actor, Lyonne said: \"I didn't have the best parents. I don't think they are bad people. Even if they were ready to have children, it is kind of a wacky idea to put your child in business at six years old.\"[7]\nAt 16 years of age, Lyonne was cast in the Woody Allen-directed Everyone Says I Love You (1996). This led to appearances in a variety of films over the next 10 years, including starring roles in the independent features Slums of Beverly Hills (1998), for which she received two Teen Choice Award nominations,[22] and But I'm a Cheerleader (1999). During this time, she appeared as Jessica in the highly successful teen comedy American Pie (1999), reprising the role in two of its sequels. Lyonne's other films during this period included Detroit Rock City, Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby (both 1999), Scary Movie 2, The Grey Zone, Kate &amp; Leopold (all 2001), Party Monster (2003), and Blade: Trinity (2004).\nLyonne's subsequent film appearances include All About Evil (2010), 4:44 Last Day on Earth (2011), Girl Most Likely, Loitering with Intent, Sleeping with Other People, Hello My Name Is Doris, Addicted to Fresno, #Horror, Yoga Hosers, Antibirth, The Intervention, and Handsome: A Netflix Mystery Movie.\n\nIn 2019, she will appear alongside Lucas Hedges and Shia LaBeouf in LaBeouf's autobiographical film Honey Boy.[23]Lyonne made her New York stage debut in the award-winning New Group production of Mike Leigh's Two Thousand Years.[4][24]\nShe was part of the original cast of the award-winning Love, Loss, and What I Wore, a play by Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron, based on the book by Ilene Beckerman.[25]\nIn 2010 Lyonne received positive reviews for her performance in Kim Rosenstock's comedy Tigers Be Still at the Roundabout Theatre Company: \"a thorough delight in the flat-out funniest role, the grief-crazed Grace, so deeply immersed in self-pity that she has cast aside any attempts at decorum\".[26][27]\nIn 2011, Lyonne starred opposite Ethan Hawke and Ann Dowd in New Group's production of Tommy Nohilly's Blood From a Stone.[28][29] The following year, she participated in New Group's benefit performance of Women Behind Bars.[30]\nOn working in the theater: \"There's something about theater that squashes the self-critical voices because you have to be in the moment. I'm glad that I didn't do this before I was ready, before I was capable of showing up every day. That is not a skill set I had before\".[29]\nLyonne has made guest appearances on the series Grounded for Life, Weeds, New Girl, Will &amp; Grace, and Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.\nSince 2013 she has appeared as Nicky Nichols on the critically acclaimed Netflix series Orange Is the New Black. The role is Lyonne's first television job as a series regular.[31] She received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2014,[32] and has twice been awarded the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, along with her co-stars.\nIn 2014 Lyonne was cast in Amy Poehler's NBC comedy pilot Old Soul, directed by David Wain.[33] In 2016 she began voicing the character Smoky Quartz on the Cartoon Network show Steven Universe. She has also appeared as various characters on IFC's sketch comedy series Portlandia. In 2018 she voiced the character Gaz Digzy on Adult Swim's comedy series Ballmastrz: 9009. More recently she has voiced characters on The Simpsons and Netflix's Big Mouth.\nHer performance in the 2019 Netflix series Russian Doll has been praised as \"astonishing\".[34] Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone called it \"brilliant\".[35]\nIn 2017, Lyonne was approached by Kenzo's creative directors Carol Lim and Humberto Leon to direct the 5th installment in their short film series. For this, her directorial debut, she began writing a script with Maya Rudolph in mind to star.[36] The surrealist short film was titled Cabiria, Charity, Chastity and starred Rudolph, Fred Armisen, Greta Lee, Leslie Odom Jr., and Macaulay Culkin.[37]\nIn September 2017, Lyonne's project Russian Doll was given an 8-episode straight to series order by Netflix.[38] The comedy, co-created and executive produced by Lyonne, Amy Poehler, and Leslye Headland, premiered on February 1, 2019.[39] Lyonne has multiple roles in the series. She is credited as the lead actress and is one of the executive producers of the series with directorial and writing credits.[40]\nLyonne also directed an episode of Orange Is the New Black for its seventh and final season, as well as an episode of Hulu's Shrill titled \"WAHAM\". [41]\nLyonne lives in New York City.[42] When she was 18, Lyonne used the paycheck from her work on Everyone Says I Love You to buy a small apartment near Gramercy Park.[8] At this time, she skipped her senior year of high school to attend NYU Tisch as a double major in film and philosophy. \nLyonne has been in a relationship with Saturday Night Live alumnus Fred Armisen since 2014.[43][44]\nDuring the early 2000s, Lyonne experienced legal problems and was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol,[45] and for incidents involving her neighbors.[46] In 2005 she was evicted by her landlord, actor Michael Rapaport, following complaints by other tenants about her behavior.[47]\nIn 2005, Lyonne was admitted to Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan under a pseudonym, suffering from hepatitis C, a heart infection, and a collapsed lung; she was also undergoing methadone treatment for heroin addiction.[48] In January 2006 a warrant was issued for her arrest after she missed a court hearing relating to her prior problems. Her lawyer said an emergency had arisen but did not give details. Later that year Lyonne was admitted to a drug and alcohol treatment center, and she appeared in court afterward. A judge sentenced her to conditional discharge.[4]\nLyonne underwent open-heart surgery in 2012 to correct valvular damage caused by her heart infection,[49] which could have resulted in sudden death if untreated.[50] She recovered from the surgery, and discussed her past health problems on The Rosie Show in March 2012.[51]\n</body></html>"

After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do. Norris is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and Judo.[3] Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film The Wrecking Crew (1969). Friend and fellow actor Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in Way of the Dragon (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested to him to take it seriously. Norris took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker! (1977) which turned a profit. His second lead Good Guys Wear Black (1978) became a hit, and Norris became a popular action film star. Norris would go on to star in a streak of bankable independently-made action and martial arts films, with A Force of One (1979), The Octagon (1980), and An Eye for an Eye (1981). This made Norris an international celebrity. He went on to make studio films like Silent Rage (1982) with Columbia, Forced Vengeance (1982) with MGM, and Lone Wolf McQuade (1983) with Orion. This led Cannon films, to sign Norris unto a multiple film deal, starting with Missing in Action (1984) which proved to be very successful and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming their leading star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon included Invasion U.S.A (1985), The Delta Force (1986), Firewalker (1986), etc. Apart from the Cannon films, Norris made Code of Silence (1985), which was received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he played the title role in the long running television series Walker, Texas Ranger, from 1993 until 2001. Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies, including Delta Force 2 (1990),The Hitman (1991), Sidekicks (1992), Forest Warrior (1996), The President's Man and its sequel (2001-2002). Norris made his last film appearance to date in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 2 (2012). Throughout his film and TV career Norris diversified from his regular endeavors. He is a noted writer, having penned books on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity, western novels, and biography. He was twice a New York Times bestselling author, first with his book on his personal philosophy of positive force and the psychology of self-improvement based on personal anecdotes called The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story (1988). His second New York Times Best Seller, Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America (2008), was about his critique on current issues in the USA. Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several products most notably being one the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials. In 2005, Norris found a new fame on the internet with Chuck Norris facts became an internet meme documenting humorous, fictional and often absurd feats of strength and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the \"facts\", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated Chuck Norris facts in advertising, the phenomenon resulted in six books (two of them New York Times Best Sellers), two video games, and several appearances on talk shows most notably Late Night with Conan O'Brien reading the facts or participating in sketches. Norris was born in Ryan, Oklahoma on March 10, 1940[4] to Wilma (n\u00e9e Scarberry) (b. 4 May 1921)[5] and Ray Dee Norris (2 June 1918 - 17 July 1971)[6], who was a World War II Army soldier,[7] a mechanic, bus driver, and truck driver.[8] Norris has stated that he has Irish and Cherokee roots.[7][9][10] Norris was named after Carlos Berry, his father's minister.[7] He has two younger brothers, Wieland and Aaron (a Hollywood producer). When Norris was sixteen, his parents divorced,[11] and he later relocated to Prairie Village, Kansas and then to Torrance, California with his mother and brothers.[9] Norris has described his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre.[12] His father, Ray, worked intermittently as an automobile mechanic, and went on alcohol drinking binges that lasted for months at a time. Embarrassed by his father's behavior and the family's financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating introversion that lasted for his entire childhood.[13] He joined the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman (AP) in 1958 and was sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea. It was there that Norris acquired the nickname Chuck and began his training in Tang Soo Do (tangsudo), an interest that led to black belts in that art and the founding of the Chun Kuk Do (\"Universal Way\") form.[14] When he returned to the United States, he continued to serve as an AP at March Air Force Base in California. Norris was discharged from the U.S. Air Force in August 1962. Following his military service, Norris applied to be a police officer in Torrance, California. While on the waiting list, Norris opened a martial arts studio. To promote it, Norris did demonstrations and fights in all kinds of events.[15] Norris started to participate in martial arts competitions. He was defeated in his first two tournaments, dropping decisions to Joe Lewis and Allen Steen. He lost three matches at the International Karate Championships to Tony Tulleners. By 1967 Norris had improved enough that he scored victories over the likes of Vic Moore. On June 3rd, at the 1967 tournament of karate, Norris defeated seven opponents, exchanged his final blows with Skipper Mullins and won the tournament.[16] On June 24th, Norris was declared champion at the S. Henry Cho's All-American Karate Championship at the Madison Square Garden, taking the title from Julio LaSalle and defeating Joe Lewis prior.[17][18][19] During this time, Norris also worked for the Northrop Corporation and opened a chain of karate schools including a storefront school in his then-hometown of Torrance, CA on Hawthorne Boulevard. Norris's official website lists celebrity clients at the schools; among them Steve McQueen, Chad McQueen, Bob Barker, Priscilla Presley, Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond.[20] In early 1968, Norris suffered the tenth and last loss of his career, losing an upset decision to Louis Delgado. On November 24, 1968, he avenged his defeat to Delgado and by doing so won the Professional Middleweight Karate champion title, which he held for six consecutive years.[11] On April 1, it was reported that Norris defended successfully his All-American Karate Championship title at the Karate tournament of champions of North America Sunday against both the heavyweight Hawk D. Frazier and light heavyweight Carlos Farrell winner of the event.[21] Again that year, Norris won for the second time the All-American Karate Championship, it was the last time Norris participated and retired undefeated.[22][23] During that time while competing, Norris met Bruce Lee, who at the time was known for the TV series The Green Hornet, noticed him. They developed a friendship, also a training and working relationship. In 1969, during the first weekend of August, Norris defended his title as world champion at the International Karate Championship. It included, fifty martial arts artists from all States and half a dozen from abroad who joined for the preliminaries.[24] Norris maintained the title.[25] Norris won Karate's triple crown for the most tournament wins of the year, and the Fighter of the Year award by Black Belt magazine. That year, Norris made his acting debut in the Dean Martin film The Wrecking Crew. In 1972, he acted as Bruce Lee's nemesis in the widely acclaimed martial arts movie Way of the Dragon (titled Return of the Dragon in its U.S. distribution). The film grossed HK$5,307,350.50 at the Hong Kong box office, beating previous records set by Lee's own films, The Big Boss and Fist of Fury, making it the highest-grossing film of 1972 in Hong Kong. The film is credited with launching him toward stardom. On the 26th of September 1973, Jonathan Kaplan's The Student Teachers premiered where Norris had a small role.[26] In 1974, actor Steve McQueen, who was his martial art student and friend at the time, saw his potential and encouraged him to begin acting classes at MGM. That same year, he played the supporting role of the main antagonist in Lo Wei's Yellow Faced Tiger.[27] Norris plays a powerful drug king in San Francisco, where he dominates the criminal world including the police department. He is eventually challenged by a young police officer who stands up to corruption.[28] The film was released theatrically in the US in 1981 as Slaughter in San Francisco. It was noticed that it was an older low-budget film announcing Norris as the lead. The film played as a double-bill to other action and genre film. It was described, a low budget martial arts actioner taking advantage of Norris' fame.[29][30][31][32][33][34] In 1975, he wrote his first book Winning Tournament Karate on the practical study of competition training for any rank. It covers all phases of executing speedy attacks, conditioning, fighting form drills, and one-step sparring techniques.[35] Norris' first starring role was 1977's Breaker! Breaker!, an action trucking film. After turning down offers to do many martial art films, Norris decided that he wanted to do films that had story and where the action would take place when it is emotionally right. The low budget film turned out to be very successful.[36] In 1978, Norris starred in the thriller, Good Guys Wear Black, that he considers to be his first significant lead role. No studio wanted to release it, so Norris and his producers four-walled it, renting the theaters and taking whatever money came in.[37] The film did very well; shot on a $1 million budget, it made over $18 million at the box office.[38] In 1979, Norris starred in A Force of One, where he played Matt Logan, a world karate champion who assists the police in their investigation.[39] The film was developed while touring for Good Guys Wear Black. Again no studio wanted to pick it up, but it out-grossed the previous film by making $20 million at the box office.[37][40] In 1980, he released The Octagon, where his character must stop a group of terrorists trained in the ninja style.[41] Unlike his previous films this time the studios were interested. American Cinema Releasing distributed it and it made almost $19 million at the box office.[37][42] In 1981, he starred in Steve Carver's An Eye for an Eye, co-starring Christopher Lee, Richard Roundtree, Matt Clark, and Mako Iwamatsu. The following year he had the lead in the action horror film Silent Rage (1982) it was his first film released by a major studio Columbia Pictures.[43] In the film Norris is a sheriff who must stop a psychopath who goes on a rampage after being granted near-indestructibility in a medical experiment. Shortly afterward MGM gave him a three-movie deal, and that same year they released Forced Vengeance (1982). Norris was unhappy with the direction they wanted to take with him, hence the contract was canceled.[37] In 1983, Norris made Lone Wolf McQuade with Orion Pictures. He played J.J. McQuade, a reckless Texas Ranger who'd rather work alone, but who gets a new partner because his captain would like to have him supervised. The partners investigate an arms dealer played by David Carradine. The film was a worldwide hit and had a positive reception from movie critics, often being compared to Sergio Leone's stylish spaghetti westerns. The film became the inspiration for Norris's future hit TV show Walker, Texas Ranger. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a 3.5 star rating, calling the character of J.J. McQuade worthy of a film series and predicting the character would be a future classic.[44][45][46] The same year, he also published his second book about general exercising called Toughen Up! the Chuck Norris Fitness System.[47] Also in 1983, Xonox produced the video game Chuck Norris Superkicks for the Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Atari 2600, and Colecovision. The game combines two types of gameplay: moving through a map, and fighting against enemies. The player takes control of Chuck Norris who has to liberate a hostage. It was later sold as Kung Fu Superkicks when the license for the use of the name Chuck Norris expired. In 1984, Norris starred in Missing in Action, the first of a series of POW rescue fantasies themed around the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue that were produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus and released under their Cannon Films banner, with which he had signed a multiple movie deal.[48] He plays Colonel James Braddock, a US military officer who spent seven years in a North Vietnamese POW camp, which he escaped 10 years ago. After the war, Braddock accompanies a government investigation team that travels to Ho Chi Minh City to investigate reports of US soldiers still held prisoner. Norris later dedicated these films to his younger brother Wieland, who was a private in the 101st Airborne Division, and had been killed in June 1970 in Vietnam while on patrol in the defense of Firebase Ripcord.[49] The film was a huge success and Norris became Cannon's most prominent star of the 1980s. In 1985, Cannon Films released Missing in Action 2: The Beginning and Invasion U.S.A. which were extremely successful. Missing in Action 2: The Beginning is a prequel to the first installment, where Colonel James Braddock is held in a North Vietnamese POW camp run by sadistic Colonel, who forces the POWs to grow opium for a French drug runner, and tries to get Braddock to admit to and sign a long list of war crimes. During his team's time in captivity, they are relentlessly subjected to various forms of torture. This leads them to attempt escape, and Braddock plots to free his fellow prisoners and destroy the prison camp. Invasion U.S.A. takes place during the Cold War area. Rostov, a Soviet operative leads a band of Latin American communist guerrillas to invade Florida. The invasion force spreads out into the South and causes havoc by shooting bazookas into suburban homes, inciting race riots by impersonating the police and attacking ethnic events, and planting bombs in churches and on school buses. With terror spreading everywhere, martial law is declared. Norris plays a former CIA agent who has had previous encounters with Rostov, and can take him on. That same year Orion Pictures released Code of Silence which received positive reviews and was also a box office success.[50][51][52][53] Code of Silence is a crime drama, and features Norris as a streetwise plainclothes officer who takes down a crime czar responsible for officers being wounded in a botched drug raid. It's considered by fans and critics as Chuck Norris's best film to date. On the 14 of February 1986, premiered Menahem Golan's The Delta Force. In it Norris co-starred with Lee Marvin, they are leaders of an elite squad of Special Forces troops based on the real life U.S. Army Delta Force unit, who face a group of Lebanese terrorists who have hijacked a Boeing 707.

He met her after she sent a letter informing him of their relationship in 1990, one year after Chuck's divorce with his first wife Dianne Holechek.[134] Norris has thirteen grandchildren as of 2017[update].[135] An outspoken Christian,[136] Norris is the author of several Christian-themed books. On April 22, 2008, Norris expressed his support for the intelligent design movement when he reviewed Ben Stein's Expelled for Townhall.com.[137] Norris is a Republican.[138] On November 18, 2008, Norris became one of the first members of show business to express support for the California Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage, and he chid activists for \"interfering\" with the democratic process and the double standard he perceived in criticizing the LDS Church without criticizing African Americans, who had voted for the measure by a wide margin.[139] During the 2012 presidential election, Norris first recommended Ron Paul, and then later formally endorsed Newt Gingrich as the Republican presidential candidate.[140] After Gingrich suspended his campaign in May 2012, Norris endorsed Republican presumptive nominee Mitt Romney, despite Norris having previously accused Romney of flip-flopping and of trying to buy the nomination for the Republican Party candidacy for 2012.[141][142] On the eve of the election he and his wife Gena made a video warning that if evangelicals didn't show up at the polls and vote out President Obama, \"...our country as we know it may be lost forever...\".[143][144] Norris also produced the film Answering the Call, which featured his 2007 trip to Iraq to visit the troops.[145][146] Norris has visited Israel and voiced support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the 2013 and 2015 elections.[147][148] Norris endorsed Huckabee again in the 2016 Republican Primary before he dropped out.[149] In March 2016, it was reported that Norris endorsed Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz and that he would be attending a Cruz rally,[150][151] but two days later, Norris stated he would only endorse the GOP nominee once that nominee has been nominated by the party.[152] He endorsed GOP nominee Donald Trump in the general election.[153] Norris endorsed former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in the 2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama.[154] In 2019, Norris signed an endorsement deal with the gun manufacturer Glock. The deal was met with criticism from some members of the public and some of his fans who felt it was bad timing due to the increase in school shootings in the United States.[155] In 1990, Norris established the United Fighting Arts Federation and Kickstart Kids. As a significant part of his philanthropic contributions, the organization was formed to develop self-esteem and focus in at-risk children as a tactic to keep them away from drug-related pressure by training them in martial arts. Norris hopes that by shifting middle school and high school children's focus towards this positive and strengthening endeavor, these children will have the opportunity to build a better future for themselves.[80][156] Norris has a ranch in Navasota, TX where they bottle water; a portion of the sales support environmental funds and Kickstart Kids. He is known for his contributions towards organizations such as Funds for Kids, Veteran's Administration National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, the United Way, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the form of donations as well as fund-raising activities.[80] His time with the U.S. Veterans Administration as a spokesperson was inspired by his experience serving the United States Air Force in Korea. His objective has been to popularize the issues that concern hospitalized war veterans such as pensions and health care. Due to his significant contributions, and continued support, he received the Veteran of the Year award in 2001 at the American Veteran Awards.[80] In India, Norris supports the Vijay Amritraj Foundation, which aims at bringing hope, help and healing to the defenseless and innocent victims of disease, tragedy and circumstance. Through his donations, he has helped the foundation support Paediatric HIV/AIDS homes in Delhi, a blind school in Karnataka, and a mission that cares for HIV/AIDS infected adults, as well as mentally ill patients in Cochin.[157]",

After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do. Norris is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and Judo.[3] Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film The Wrecking Crew (1969). Friend and fellow actor Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in Way of the Dragon (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested to him to take it seriously. Norris took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker! (1977) which turned a profit. His second lead Good Guys Wear Black (1978) became a hit, and Norris became a popular action film star. \nNorris would go on to star in a streak of bankable independently-made action and martial arts films, with A Force of One (1979), The Octagon (1980), and An Eye for an Eye (1981). This made Norris an international celebrity. He went on to make studio films like Silent Rage (1982) with Columbia, Forced Vengeance (1982) with MGM, and Lone Wolf McQuade (1983) with Orion. This led Cannon films, to sign Norris unto a multiple film deal, starting with Missing in Action (1984) which proved to be very successful and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming their leading star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon included Invasion U.S.A (1985), The Delta Force (1986), Firewalker (1986), etc. Apart from the Cannon films, Norris made Code of Silence (1985), which was received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he played the title role in the long running television series Walker, Texas Ranger, from 1993 until 2001.  Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies, including Delta Force 2 (1990),The Hitman (1991), Sidekicks (1992), Forest Warrior (1996), The President's Man and its sequel (2001-2002). Norris made his last film appearance to date in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 2 (2012).\nThroughout his film and TV career Norris diversified from his regular endeavors. He is a noted writer, having penned books on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity, western novels, and biography. He was twice a New York Times bestselling author, first with his book on his personal philosophy of positive force and the psychology of self-improvement based on personal anecdotes called The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story (1988). His second New York Times Best Seller, Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America (2008), was about his critique on current issues in the USA. Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several products most notably being one the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials. In 2005, Norris found a new fame on the internet with Chuck Norris facts became an internet meme documenting humorous, fictional and often absurd feats of strength and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the \"facts\", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated Chuck Norris facts in advertising, the phenomenon resulted in six books (two of them New York Times Best Sellers), two video games, and several appearances on talk shows most notably Late Night with Conan O'Brien reading the facts or participating in sketches.\nNorris was born in Ryan, Oklahoma on March 10, 1940[4] to Wilma (n\u00e9e Scarberry) (b. 4 May 1921)[5] and Ray Dee Norris (2 June 1918 - 17 July 1971)[6], who was a World War II Army soldier,[7] a mechanic, bus driver, and truck driver.[8] Norris has stated that he has Irish and Cherokee roots.[7][9][10] Norris was named after Carlos Berry, his father's minister.[7] He has two younger brothers, Wieland and Aaron (a Hollywood producer). When Norris was sixteen, his parents divorced,[11] and he later relocated to Prairie Village, Kansas and then to Torrance, California with his mother and brothers.[9]\nNorris has described his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre.[12] His father, Ray, worked intermittently as an automobile mechanic, and went on alcohol drinking binges that lasted for months at a time. Embarrassed by his father's behavior and the family's financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating introversion that lasted for his entire childhood.[13]\nHe joined the United States Air Force as an Air Policeman (AP) in 1958 and was sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea. It was there that Norris acquired the nickname Chuck and began his training in Tang Soo Do (tangsudo), an interest that led to black belts in that art and the founding of the Chun Kuk Do (\"Universal Way\") form.[14] When he returned to the United States, he continued to serve as an AP at March Air Force Base in California. \nNorris was discharged from the U.S. Air Force in August 1962. Following his military service, Norris applied to be a police officer in Torrance, California. While on the waiting list, Norris opened a martial arts studio. To promote it, Norris did demonstrations and fights in all kinds of events.[15]\nNorris started to participate in martial arts competitions. He was defeated in his first two tournaments, dropping decisions to Joe Lewis and Allen Steen. He lost three matches at the International Karate Championships to Tony Tulleners. By 1967 Norris had improved enough that he scored victories over the likes of Vic Moore. On June 3rd,  at the 1967 tournament of karate, Norris defeated seven opponents, exchanged his final blows with Skipper Mullins and won the tournament.[16] On June 24th, Norris was declared champion at the S. Henry Cho's All-American Karate Championship at the Madison Square Garden, taking the title from Julio LaSalle and defeating Joe Lewis prior.[17][18][19] During this time, Norris also worked for the Northrop Corporation and opened a chain of karate schools including a storefront school in his then-hometown of Torrance, CA on Hawthorne Boulevard.

Norris hopes that by shifting middle school and high school children's focus towards this positive and strengthening endeavor, these children will have the opportunity to build a better future for themselves.[80][156]  Norris has a ranch in Navasota, TX where they bottle water; a portion of the sales support environmental funds and Kickstart Kids.\nHe is known for his contributions towards organizations such as Funds for Kids, Veteran's Administration National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, the United Way, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the form of donations as well as fund-raising activities.[80]\nHis time with the U.S. Veterans Administration as a spokesperson was inspired by his experience serving the United States Air Force in Korea. His objective has been to popularize the issues that concern hospitalized war veterans such as pensions and health care. Due to his significant contributions, and continued support, he received the Veteran of the Year award in 2001 at the American Veteran Awards.[80]\nIn India, Norris supports the Vijay Amritraj Foundation, which aims at bringing hope, help and healing to the defenseless and innocent victims of disease, tragedy and circumstance. Through his donations, he has helped the foundation support Paediatric HIV/AIDS homes in Delhi, a blind school in Karnataka, and a mission that cares for HIV/AIDS infected adults, as well as mentally ill patients in Cochin.[157]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nTheodore John Kaczynski (/k\u0259\u02c8z\u026anski/; born May 22, 1942), also known as the Unabomber (/\u02c8ju\u02d0n\u0259b\u0252m\u0259r/), is an American domestic terrorist, anarchist, and former mathematics professor.[2][3][4] He was a mathematics prodigy,[5] but he abandoned an academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle. Between 1978 and 1995, he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology. In 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient. He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable; he began his bombing campaign in 1978. In 1995, he sent a letter to The New York Times and promised to \"desist from terrorism\" if The Times or The Washington Post published his essay Industrial Society and Its Future, in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization. Kaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Before his identity was known, the FBI used the acronym UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\". The FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of Industrial Society and Its Future, which led to a tip from Kaczynski's brother David, who recognized the writing style. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted him to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty, as he did not believe that he was insane. In 1998, a plea bargain was reached under which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Theodore John Kaczynski was born on May 22, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to working-class, second-generation Polish Americans, Wanda Theresa (n\u00e9e Dombek) and Theodore Richard Kaczynski,[6] a sausage maker.[7] His parents told his younger brother, David Kaczynski, that Ted had been a happy baby until severe hives forced him into hospital isolation with limited contact with others, after which he \"showed little emotion for months\".[8] Wanda recalled Ted recoiling from a picture of himself as an infant being held down by physicians examining his hives. She said he showed sympathy to animals who were in cages or otherwise helpless, which she speculated stemmed from his experience in hospital isolation.[9] From first to fourth grade, Kaczynski attended Sherman Elementary School in Chicago, where administrators described him as \"healthy\" and \"well-adjusted\".[10] In 1952, three years after David was born, the family moved to southwest suburban Evergreen Park, Illinois; Ted transferred to Evergreen Park Central Junior High School. After testing scored his IQ at 167,[11] he skipped the sixth grade. Kaczynski later described this as a pivotal event: previously he had socialized with his peers and was even a leader, but after skipping ahead he felt he did not fit in with the older children and was bullied.[12] Neighbors in Evergreen Park later described the Kaczynski family as \"civic-minded folks\", with one stating that the parents \"sacrificed everything they had for their children\".[8] Both Ted and David were intelligent, but Ted stood out in particular. One neighbor said she had \"never known anyone who had a brain like he did\",[13] while another said that Ted was \"strictly a loner\" who \"didn't play\u00a0... an old man before his time.\"[8] His mother recalled Ted as a shy child who would become unresponsive if pressured into a social situation.[14] At one point she was so worried about Ted's social development that she considered entering him in a study for autistic children led by Bruno Bettelheim. She decided against it after observing Bettelheim's abrupt and cold manner.[15] In 1990, Ted's father Theodore, suffering from terminal cancer, died by suicide with a .22 caliber rifle. Theodore spent his last days with his family members, showing them affection as an implicit farewell.[16] Kaczynski attended Evergreen Park Community High School where he excelled academically. He played the trombone in the marching band and was a member of the mathematics, biology, coin, and German clubs but was regarded as an outsider by his classmates.[17][18] In 1996, a former classmate said: \"He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality\u00a0... He was always regarded as a walking brain, so to speak.\"[8] During this period, Kaczynski became intensely interested in mathematics, spending hours studying and solving advanced problems. He became associated with a group of likeminded boys interested in science and mathematics, known as the \"briefcase boys\" for their penchant for carrying briefcases.[18] One member of this group recalled Kaczynski as \"the smartest kid in the class\u00a0... just quiet and shy until you got to know him. Once he knew you, he could talk and talk.\"[8] Throughout high school, Kaczynski was ahead of his classmates academically. Placed in a more advanced mathematics class, he soon mastered the material. He skipped the eleventh grade, and by attending summer school he graduated at age 15. He was one of his school's five National Merit finalists, and was encouraged to apply to Harvard College.[17] He entered Harvard on a scholarship in 1958 at the age of 16.[19] A classmate later said that Kaczynski was emotionally unprepared: \"They packed him up and sent him to Harvard before he was ready\u00a0... He didn't even have a driver's license.\"[8] During his first year at Harvard, Kaczynski lived at 8 Prescott Street, which was designed to accommodate the youngest, most precocious freshmen in a small, intimate living space. For the next three years he lived at Eliot House. One of his suitemates there recalled that he avoided contact with others and \"would just rush through the suite, go into his room, and slam the door.\" Another said Kaczynski was reserved, but regarded him as a genius: \"It's just an opinion\u00a0\u2013 but Ted was brilliant.\" Other students stated Kaczynski was less socially averse than these descriptions imply; an Eliot House resident who dined with Kaczynski at times called him \"very quiet, but personable\u00a0... He would enter into the discussions maybe a little less so than most [but] he was certainly friendly.\"[20] Kaczynski earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard in 1962.[21][22] He finished with a 3.12 GPA, but had been expected to perform better.[23] As a sophomore, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alston Chase as a \"purposely brutalizing psychological experiment\" led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. Subjects were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student, and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who in a later session would confront and belittle the subject\u00a0\u2013 making \"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\" attacks\u00a0\u2013 using the content of the essays as ammunition, while electrodes monitored the subject's physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects' expressions of anger and rage were later played back to them repeatedly.[24] The experiment lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week.[25][26] Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study.[27] Kaczynski's lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to his participation in Murray's study.[24] Some sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of Project MKUltra, the Central Intelligence Agency's research into mind control.[28][29][30] Chase[31][32] and others[33][34] have also suggested that this experience may have motivated Kaczynski's criminal activities. In 1962, Kaczynski enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he earned his master's and doctoral degrees in mathematics in 1964 and 1967, respectively. Michigan was not his first choice for postgraduate education; he had also applied to the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago, both of which accepted him but offered him no teaching position or financial aid. Michigan offered him an annual grant of $2,310 (equivalent to $19,343 in 2018) and a teaching post.[23] At the University of Michigan, Kaczynski specialized in complex analysis, specifically geometric function theory. His intellect and drive impressed his professors. \"He was an unusual person. He was not like the other graduate students. He was much more focused about his work. He had a drive to discover mathematical truth,\" said professor Peter Duren. \"It is not enough to say he was smart,\" said George Piranian, another of his Michigan mathematics professors.[35] At Michigan, Kaczynski earned 5 Bs and 12 As in his 18 courses. However, in 2006, he said his \"memories of the University of Michigan are NOT pleasant\u00a0... the fact that I not only passed my courses (except one physics course) but got quite a few As, shows how wretchedly low the standards were at Michigan.\"[23] In 1967, Kaczynski's dissertation Boundary Functions[36] won the Sumner B. Myers Prize for Michigan's best mathematics dissertation of the year.[8] Allen Shields, his doctoral advisor, called it \"the best I have ever directed\",[23] and Maxwell Reade, a member of his dissertation committee, said \"I would guess that maybe 10 or 12 men in the country understood or appreciated it.\"[35][8] Kaczynski published two journal articles related to his dissertation, and three more after leaving Michigan.[36][37] In late 1967, the 25-year-old Kaczynski became the youngest assistant professor of mathematics in the history of University of California, Berkeley up to that time, where he taught undergraduate courses in geometry and calculus.[38] His teaching evaluations suggest he was not well-liked by his students: he seemed uncomfortable teaching, taught straight from the textbook and refused to answer questions.[8] Without any explanation, Kaczynski resigned on June 30, 1969.[39] At the time, the chairman of the mathematics department, J.\u00a0W. Addison, called this a \"sudden and unexpected\" resignation.[40][41] In 1996, vice chairman at Berkeley, Calvin C. Moore said, given Kaczynski's \"impressive\" dissertation and publications, he \"could have advanced up the ranks and been a senior member of the faculty today.\"[42] A 1996 Los Angeles Times article stated: \"The field that Kaczynski worked in doesn't really exist today [according to mathematicians interviewed about his work]. Most of its theories were proven in the 1960s, when Kaczynski worked in it.\" According to mathematician Donald Rung, \"[Kaczynski] probably would have gone on to some other area if he were to stay in mathematics.\"[39] After resigning from Berkeley, Kaczynski moved to his parents' home in Lombard, Illinois, then two years later, in 1971, to a remote cabin he had built outside Lincoln, Montana, where he could live a simple life with little money and without electricity or running water,[43] working odd jobs and receiving some financial support from his family.[8] His original goal was to become self-sufficient so that he could live autonomously. He taught himself survival skills such as tracking game, edible plant identification, organic farming, bow drilling and other primitive technologies.[44] He used an old bicycle to get to town, and a volunteer at the local library said he visited frequently to read classic works in their original languages. Other Lincoln residents said later that such a lifestyle was not unusual in the area.[45] Kaczynski decided it was impossible to live peacefully in nature because of the destruction of the wildland around his cabin by real estate development and industrial projects.[44] In response, he began performing acts of sabotage against nearby developments in 1975,[46] and dedicated himself to reading about sociology and political philosophy, such as the works of Jacques Ellul. In an interview after his arrest, he recalled being shocked on a hike to one of his favorite wild spots:[44] It's kind of rolling country, not flat, and when you get to the edge of it you find these ravines that cut very steeply in to cliff-like drop-offs and there was even a waterfall there. It was about a two days' hike from my cabin. That was the best spot until the summer of 1983. That summer there were too many people around my cabin so I decided I needed some peace. I went back to the plateau and when I got there I found they had put a road right through the middle of it\u00a0... You just can't imagine how upset I was. It was from that point on I decided that, rather than trying to acquire further wilderness skills, I would work on getting back at the system. Revenge. In that 1999 interview, he described his loss of faith in the potential for reform. He decided that the \"human tendency\u00a0... to take the path of least resistance\" meant that violent collapse was the only way to bring down the industrial-technological system:[44] They'll take the easy way out, and giving up your car, your television set, your electricity, is not the path of least resistance for most people. As I see it, I don't think there is any controlled or planned way in which we can dismantle the industrial system. I think that the only way we will get rid of it is if it breaks down and collapses\u00a0... The big problem is that people don't believe a revolution is possible, and it is not possible precisely because they do not believe it is possible. To a large extent I think the eco-anarchist movement is accomplishing a great deal, but I think they could do it better\u00a0... The real revolutionaries should separate themselves from the reformers\u00a0... And I think that it would be good if a conscious effort was being made to get as many people as possible introduced to the wilderness. In a general way, I think what has to be done is not to try and convince or persuade the majority of people that we are right, as much as try to increase tensions in society to the point where things start to break down. To create a situation where people get uncomfortable enough that they're going to rebel. So the question is how do you increase those tensions? Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski mailed or hand-delivered a series of increasingly sophisticated bombs that cumulatively killed three people and injured 23 others. In all, 16 bombs were attributed to Kaczynski. While the bombing devices varied widely through the years, all but the first few contained the initials \"FC\", which Kaczynski later said stood for \"Freedom Club\",[47] inscribed on parts inside. He purposely left misleading clues in the devices and took extreme care in preparing them to avoid leaving fingerprints; latent fingerprints on some of the devices did not match those found on letters attributed to Kaczynski.[a] Kaczynski's first mail bomb was directed at Buckley Crist, a professor of materials engineering at Northwestern University. On May 25, 1978, a package bearing Crist's return address was found in a parking lot at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The package was \"returned\" to Crist who was suspicious because he had not sent the package, so he contacted campus police. Officer Terry Marker opened the package, which exploded and injured his left hand.[49] Kaczynski had returned to Illinois for the May 1978 bombing, and stayed there for a time to work with his father and brother at a foam rubber factory. However, in August 1978 he was fired by his brother for writing insulting limericks about a female supervisor whom he had briefly courted.[50][51] The female supervisor later recalled Kaczynski as \"intelligent, quiet,\" but remembered little of their acquaintance and firmly denied they had had any romantic relationship.[52] The initial 1978 bombing was followed by bombs sent to airline officials, and in 1979 a bomb was placed in the cargo hold of American Airlines Flight 444, a Boeing 727 flying from Chicago to Washington, D.C. A faulty timing mechanism prevented the bomb from exploding, but it released smoke, which forced an emergency landing. Authorities said it had enough power to \"obliterate the plane\" had it exploded.[49] As bombing an airliner is a federal crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation became involved, designating the case UNABOM for University and Airline Bomber. Kaczynski left false clues in every bomb, which he made hard to find to make them believable. The first clue was a metal plate stamped with the initials FC hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe end cap) in every bomb.[48] Another clue included a note left in a bomb that did not detonate; it read \"Wu\u2014It works! I told you it would\u2014RV\".[53] Another clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes.[54] He sent one bomb embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.[49] The FBI theorized that Kaczynski had a theme of nature, trees and wood in his crimes. He often included bits of tree branch and bark in his bombs, and targets selected included Percy Wood and Professor Leroy Wood. Crime writer Robert Graysmith noted that his \"obsession with wood\" was \"a large factor.\"[55] The first serious injury occurred in 1985, when John Hauser, a graduate student and captain in the United States Air Force, lost four fingers and vision in one eye.[56] The bomb, like others of Kaczynski's, was handcrafted and made with wooden parts.[57] Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised as a piece of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to remove it from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body.[b] In 1993, after a six-year break, Kaczynski mailed a bomb to David Gelernter, a computer science professor at Yale University. Though critically injured, Gelernter recovered. In the same weekend, Kaczynski mailed a bomb to the home of Charles Epstein from the University of California, San Francisco, who lost several fingers upon opening it. Kaczynski then called Gelernter's brother, Joel Gelernter, a behavioral geneticist, and told him, \"You are next.\"[59] Geneticist Phillip Sharp at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology received a threatening letter two years later.[60] In 1994, Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas J. Mosser was killed by a mail bomb sent to his home in North Caldwell, New Jersey. In another letter to The New York Times, Kaczynski said he \"blew up Thomas Mosser because ... Burston-Marsteller helped Exxon clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident\" and, more importantly, because \"Its business is the development of techniques for manipulating people's attitudes.\"[61] This was followed by the 1995 murder of Gilbert Brent Murray, president of the timber industry lobbying group California Forestry Association, by a mail bomb addressed to previous president William Dennison, who had retired.[60] In 1995, Kaczynski mailed several letters to media outlets outlining his goals and demanding that his 35,000-word essay Industrial Society and Its Future (dubbed the Unabomber Manifesto by the FBI)[64][65] be printed verbatim by a major newspaper. He stated that, if this demand was met, he would \"desist from terrorism\".[66][67][68] There was controversy as to whether the essay should be published, but Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh recommended its publication out of concern for public safety and in hope that a reader could identify the author. Bob Guccione of Penthouse volunteered to publish it, but Kaczynski replied that Penthouse was less \"respectable\" than the other publications. He said that he would \"reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, after our manuscript has been published\".[69] The New York Times and The Washington Post both published the essay on September 19, 1995.[70][71] Kaczynski wrote the document on a typewriter (therefore without italics); he capitalized entire words to show emphasis. He always referred to himself as either \"we\" or \"FC\" (\"Freedom Club\"), though there is no evidence that he worked with others. Academic Donald Wayne Foster analyzed the writing at the request of Kaczynski's defense team, and he noted that it contains irregular spelling and hyphenation and other linguistic idiosyncrasies, which led him to conclude that Kaczynski was its author.[72] Industrial Society and Its Future begins with Kaczynski's assertion: \"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.\"[73][74] He writes that technology has had a destabilizing effect on society, has made life unfulfilling, and has caused widespread psychological suffering.[75] He argues that most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits because of technological advances; he calls these \"surrogate activities\" wherein people strive toward artificial goals, including scientific work, consumption of entertainment, and following sports teams.[75] He predicts that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted to meet the needs of the social systems, rather than vice versa.[75] He believes that technological progress can be stopped, unlike people who understand technology's negative effects yet passively accept it as inevitable.[76] He calls for a return to \"wild nature.\"[75] Kaczynski argues that the erosion of human freedom is a natural product of an industrial society because \"the system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function\", and that reform of the system is impossible because \"changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt the system\".[77] However, he states that the system has not yet fully achieved \"control over human behavior\" and \"is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival\". He predicts that \"if the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. Otherwise it will break down,\" and that \"the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years\".[77] He states that the task of those who oppose industrial society is to promote \"social stress and instability\" and to propagate \"an ideology that opposes technology\", one that offers the \"counter-ideal\" of nature \"in order to gain enthusiastic support\". A \"revolution against technology may be possible\" when industrial society is sufficiently unstable.[78] Throughout the document, Kaczynski addresses left-wing politics as a movement. He defines leftists as \"mainly socialists, collectivists, 'politically correct' types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like\",[79] states that leftism is driven primarily by \"feelings of inferiority\" and \"oversocialization\",[75] and derides leftism as \"one of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world\".[79] He additionally states that \"a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must take a resolutely anti-leftist stance and must avoid all collaboration with leftists\", as in his view \"leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature, with human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology\".[73] He also criticizes conservatives, describing them as \"fools\" who \"whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth.\"[79] Alston Chase reported in The Atlantic that the text \"was greeted in 1995 by many thoughtful people as a work of genius, or at least profundity, and as quite sane\".[80] Chase argued, however, that it \"is the work of neither a genius nor a maniac.\" \"Its pessimism over the direction of civilization and its rejection of the modern world are shared especially with the country's most highly educated.\"[80] UCLA political science professor James Q. Wilson was mentioned in the manifesto; he wrote in The New Yorker that Industrial Society and Its Future was \"a carefully reasoned, artfully written paper\". \"If it is the work of a madman, then the writings of many political philosophers\u2026 are scarcely more sane.\"[81] David Skrbina, a philosophy professor at the University of Michigan and a former Green Party candidate for governor of Michigan, has written several essays in support of Kaczynski's ideas, one which is titled \"A Revolutionary for Our Times\".[82][83][84] Paul Kingsnorth, a former deputy-editor of The Ecologist and a co-founder of the Dark Mountain Project, wrote an essay for Orion Magazine in which he described Kaczynski's arguments as \"worryingly convincing\" and stated that they \"may change my life\".[85] Psychiatrist Keith Ablow stated on Fox News that Kaczynski was \"reprehensible for murdering and maiming people\" but \"precisely correct in many of his ideas\", and he compared Industrial Society and Its Future to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.[86] Anarcho-primitivist authors such as John Zerzan and John Moore came to Kaczynski's defense while also holding reservations about his actions and ideas.[87][88] The manifesto echoed contemporary critics of technology and industrialization such as John Zerzan, Jacques Ellul,[89] Rachel Carson, Lewis Mumford, and E. F. Schumacher.[90] Its idea of the \"disruption of the power process\" similarly echoed social critics emphasizing the lack of meaningful work as a primary cause of social problems, including Mumford, Paul Goodman, and Eric Hoffer.[90] Its general theme was also addressed by Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, to which Kaczynski refers in the text.[91] Kaczynski's ideas of \"oversocialization\" and \"surrogate activities\" recall Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents and its theories of rationalization and sublimation (a term which Kaczynski uses three times to describe \"surrogate activities\").[92] Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, wrote that Kaczynski is \"clearly a Luddite\", but \"simply saying this does not dismiss his argument\".[93] Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks,[94] published a manifesto and copied large portions from Industrial Society and Its Future, with certain terms substituted (e.g., replacing \"leftists\" with \"cultural Marxists\" and \"multiculturalists\").[95][96][97] Over twenty years after Kaczynski's imprisonment, his views have inspired online communities of primitivists and neo-Luddites. One explanation for the renewal of interest in his views is the television series Manhunt: Unabomber, which aired in 2017.[98] Kaczynski is also frequently referenced by ecofascists online.[99] University of Michigan\u2013Dearborn philosophy professor David Skrbina helped to compile Kaczynski's work into the 2010 anthology Technological Slavery, including the original manifesto, letters between Skrbina and Kaczynski, and other essays.[100] Kaczynski updated his 1995 manifesto as Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How to address advances in computers and the Internet. He advocates practicing other types of protest and makes no mention of violence.[101] Because of the material used to make the mail bombs, the suspect was labeled the \"Junkyard Bomber\" by U.S. Postal Inspectors, who initially had responsibility for the case.[102] FBI Inspector Terry D. Turchie was appointed to run the UNABOM investigation.[103] In 1979, an FBI-led task force that included 125 agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and U.S. Postal Inspection Service was formed.[103] The task force grew to more than 150 full-time personnel, but minute analysis of recovered components of the bombs and the investigation into the lives of the victims proved of little use in identifying the suspect, who built his bombs primarily from scrap materials available almost anywhere. The victims, investigators later learned, were chosen irregularly from library research. In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, working with agents in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a psychological profile of the unidentified bomber. It described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence and connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983. An alternative theory was developed by FBI analysts that concentrated on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic.[104] A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take calls related to the investigation, with a $1\u00a0million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.[105] Before the publication of Industrial Society and Its Future, Ted's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife to follow up on suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber.[106] David was dismissive at first, but he began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He searched through old family papers and found letters dating to the 1970s that Ted had sent to newspapers to protest the abuses of technology using phrasing similar to the manifesto.[107] Before the manifesto's publication, the FBI held many press conferences asking the public to help identify the Unabomber. They were convinced that the bomber was from the Chicago area where he began his bombings, had worked in or had some connection to Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s had some association with the San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical information, as well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire text of the manifesto was published, persuaded David's wife to urge her husband to read the manifesto.[108][109] After the manifesto was published, the FBI received over a thousand calls a day for months in response to its offer of a $1\u00a0million reward for information leading to the identification of the Unabomber. Many letters claiming to be from the Unabomber were also sent to the UNABOM Task Force, and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, Kaczynski's brother David hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly.[110] David later hired Washington, D.C. attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize the evidence acquired by Swanson and make contact with the FBI, given the presumed difficulty of attracting the FBI's attention. David wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, such as the Ruby Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he feared a violent outcome from any attempt by the FBI to contact his brother.[111] In early 1996, former FBI hostage negotiator and criminal profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt to compare the manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.[111] In February 1996, Bisceglie gave a copy of the 1971 essay written by Ted Kaczynski to Molly Flynn at the FBI.[103] She forwarded the essay to the San Francisco-based task force. FBI Profiler James R. Fitzgerald[112][113] recognized similarities in the writings using linguistic analysis and determined that the author of the essays and the manifesto were almost certainly the same. Combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, the analysis provided the basis for a search warrant signed by Terry Turchie, the head of the entire investigation.[103] David Kaczynski had tried to remain anonymous, but he was soon identified, and within a few days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with behavioral analysis Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, whom he met many times in Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.[114] David had once admired and emulated his older brother but later decided to leave the survivalist lifestyle behind.[115] He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified.[115] FBI officials were not unanimous in identifying Ted as the author of the manifesto. The search warrant noted that numerous experts believed the manifesto had been written by another individual.[48] FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, where he was found in an unkempt state. A search of his cabin revealed a cache of bomb components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of the Unabomber crimes and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found what appeared to be the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future.[116] By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history.[117][118] After his capture, theories emerged naming Kaczynski as the Zodiac Killer. Among the links that raised suspicion was the fact that Kaczynski lived in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1967 to 1969 (the same period that most of the Zodiac's confirmed killings occurred in California), that both individuals were highly intelligent with an interest in bombs and codes, and that both wrote letters to newspapers demanding the publication of their works with the threat of continued violence if the demand was not met. However, Kaczynski's whereabouts could not be verified for all of the killings, and the gun and knife murders committed by the Zodiac Killer differ from Kaczynski's bombings, so he was not further pursued as a suspect. Robert Graysmith, author of the 1986 book Zodiac, said the similarities are \"fascinating\" but purely coincidental.[119] The early hunt for the Unabomber portrayed a perpetrator far different from the eventual suspect. Industrial Society and Its Future consistently uses \"we\" and \"our\" throughout, and at one point in 1993 investigators sought an individual whose first name was \"Nathan\" because the name was imprinted on the envelope of a letter sent to the media.[53] When the case was presented to the public, authorities denied that there was ever anyone other than Kaczynski involved in the crimes.[106] A federal grand jury indicted Kaczynski in April 1996 on ten counts of illegally transporting, mailing, and using bombs, and three counts of murder.[120] Kaczynski's lawyers, headed by Montana federal public defenders Michael Donahoe and Judy Clarke, attempted to enter an insanity defense to avoid the death penalty, but Kaczynski rejected this strategy. On January 8, 1998, he requested to dismiss his lawyers and hire Tony Serra as his counsel; Serra had agreed not to use an insanity defense and instead base a defense on Kaczynski's anti-technology views.[121][122][123] This request was unsuccessful and Kaczynski subsequently tried to commit suicide by hanging on January 9.[124] Several, though not all, forensic psychiatrists and psychologists who examined Kaczynski diagnosed him as having paranoid schizophrenia. Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz said Kaczynski was not psychotic but had a schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder.[125] In his 2010 book Technological Slavery, Kaczynski said that two prison psychologists who visited him frequently for four years told him they saw no indication that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and the diagnosis was \"ridiculous\" and a \"political diagnosis\".[126] On January 21, 1998, Kaczynski was declared competent to stand trial \"despite the psychiatric diagnoses\".[127][128] As he was fit to stand trial, prosecutors sought the death penalty but Kaczynski avoided that by pleading guilty to all charges on January 22, 1998, and accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. He later tried to withdraw this plea, arguing it was involuntary. Judge Garland Ellis Burrell Jr. denied his request, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld that decision.[129] In 2006, Burrell ordered that items from Kaczynski's cabin be sold at a \"reasonably advertised Internet auction.\" Items considered to be bomb-making materials, such as diagrams and \"recipes\" for bombs, were excluded. The net proceeds went towards the $15\u00a0million in restitution Burrell had awarded Kaczynski's victims.[130] Kaczynski's correspondence and other personal papers were also auctioned.[131][132][133] Burrell ordered the removal, before sale, of references in those documents to Kaczynski's victims; Kaczynski unsuccessfully challenged those redactions as a violation of his freedom of speech.[134][135][136] The auction raised $232,000.[137] Kaczynski is serving eight life sentences without the possibility of parole at ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.[134][138] When asked in 1999 if he was afraid of losing his mind in prison, Kaczynski replied: No, what worries me is that I might in a sense adapt to this environment and come to be comfortable here and not resent it anymore. And I am afraid that as the years go by that I may forget, I may begin to lose my memories of the mountains and the woods and that's what really worries me, that I might lose those memories, and lose that sense of contact with wild nature in general. But I am not afraid they are going to break my spirit.[44] In 2016, it was reported that early on in his imprisonment Kaczynski had befriended Ramzi Yousef and Timothy McVeigh, the perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing, respectively. The trio discussed religion and politics and formed a friendship which lasted until McVeigh's execution in 2001.[139] Kaczynski's cabin was seized by the U.S. government and was on display at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.[140] In October 2005, Kaczynski offered to donate two rare books to the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies at Northwestern University's campus in Evanston, Illinois, the location of his first two attacks. Northwestern rejected the offer due to already having copies of the works.[141] The Labadie Collection, part of the University of Michigan's Special Collections Library, houses Kaczynski's correspondence with over 400 people since his arrest, including replies, legal documents, publications, and clippings.[142][143] His writings are among the most popular selections in the University of Michigan's special collections.[100] The identity of most correspondents will remain sealed until 2049.[142][144] In 2012, Kaczynski responded to the Harvard Alumni Association's directory inquiry for the fiftieth reunion of the class of 1962; he listed his occupation as \"prisoner\" and his eight life sentences as \"awards\".[145]",

Between 1978 and 1995, he killed three people and injured 23 others in an attempt to start a revolution by conducting a nationwide bombing campaign targeting people involved with modern technology. \nIn 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient. He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was untenable; he began his bombing campaign in 1978. In 1995, he sent a letter to The New York Times and promised to \"desist from terrorism\" if The Times or The Washington Post published his essay Industrial Society and Its Future, in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies that require large-scale organization.\nKaczynski was the subject of the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Before his identity was known, the FBI used the acronym UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\". The FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of Industrial Society and Its Future, which led to a tip from Kaczynski's brother David, who recognized the writing style.\nAfter his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted him to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty, as he did not believe that he was insane. In 1998, a plea bargain was reached under which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nTheodore John Kaczynski was born on May 22, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to working-class, second-generation Polish Americans, Wanda Theresa (n\u00e9e Dombek) and Theodore Richard Kaczynski,[6] a sausage maker.[7] His parents told his younger brother, David Kaczynski, that Ted had been a happy baby until severe hives forced him into hospital isolation with limited contact with others, after which he \"showed little emotion for months\".[8] Wanda recalled Ted recoiling from a picture of himself as an infant being held down by physicians examining his hives. She said he showed sympathy to animals who were in cages or otherwise helpless, which she speculated stemmed from his experience in hospital isolation.[9]\nFrom first to fourth grade, Kaczynski attended Sherman Elementary School in Chicago, where administrators described him as \"healthy\" and \"well-adjusted\".[10] In 1952, three years after David was born, the family moved to southwest suburban Evergreen Park, Illinois; Ted transferred to Evergreen Park Central Junior High School. After testing scored his IQ at 167,[11] he skipped the sixth grade. Kaczynski later described this as a pivotal event: previously he had socialized with his peers and was even a leader, but after skipping ahead he felt he did not fit in with the older children and was bullied.[12]\nNeighbors in Evergreen Park later described the Kaczynski family as \"civic-minded folks\", with one stating that the parents \"sacrificed everything they had for their children\".[8] Both Ted and David were intelligent, but Ted stood out in particular. One neighbor said she had \"never known anyone who had a brain like he did\",[13] while another said that Ted was \"strictly a loner\" who \"didn't play\u00a0... an old man before his time.\"[8] His mother recalled Ted as a shy child who would become unresponsive if pressured into a social situation.[14] At one point she was so worried about Ted's social development that she considered entering him in a study for autistic children led by Bruno Bettelheim. She decided against it after observing Bettelheim's abrupt and cold manner.[15]\nIn 1990, Ted's father Theodore, suffering from terminal cancer, died by suicide with a .22 caliber rifle. Theodore spent his last days with his family members, showing them affection as an implicit farewell.[16]\nKaczynski attended Evergreen Park Community High School where he excelled academically. He played the trombone in the marching band and was a member of the mathematics, biology, coin, and German clubs but was regarded as an outsider by his classmates.[17][18] In 1996, a former classmate said: \"He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality\u00a0... He was always regarded as a walking brain, so to speak.\"[8] During this period, Kaczynski became intensely interested in mathematics, spending hours studying and solving advanced problems. He became associated with a group of likeminded boys interested in science and mathematics, known as the \"briefcase boys\" for their penchant for carrying briefcases.[18] One member of this group recalled Kaczynski as \"the smartest kid in the class\u00a0... just quiet and shy until you got to know him. Once he knew you, he could talk and talk.\"[8]\nThroughout high school, Kaczynski was ahead of his classmates academically. Placed in a more advanced mathematics class, he soon mastered the material. He skipped the eleventh grade, and by attending summer school he graduated at age 15. He was one of his school's five National Merit finalists, and was encouraged to apply to Harvard College.[17] He entered Harvard on a scholarship in 1958 at the age of 16.[19] A classmate later said that Kaczynski was emotionally unprepared: \"They packed him up and sent him to Harvard before he was ready\u00a0... He didn't even have a driver's license.\"[8]\nDuring his first year at Harvard, Kaczynski lived at 8 Prescott Street, which was designed to accommodate the youngest, most precocious freshmen in a small, intimate living space. For the next three years he lived at Eliot House. One of his suitemates there recalled that he avoided contact with others and \"would just rush through the suite, go into his room, and slam the door.\" Another said Kaczynski was reserved, but regarded him as a genius: \"It's just an opinion\u00a0\u2013 but Ted was brilliant.\" Other students stated Kaczynski was less socially averse than these descriptions imply; an Eliot House resident who dined with Kaczynski at times called him \"very quiet, but personable\u00a0... He would enter into the discussions maybe a little less so than most [but] he was certainly friendly.\"[20]\nKaczynski earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard in 1962.[21][22] He finished with a 3.12 GPA, but had been expected to perform better.[23]\nAs a sophomore, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alston Chase as a \"purposely brutalizing psychological experiment\" led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. Subjects were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student, and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who in a later session would confront and belittle the subject\u00a0\u2013 making \"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\" attacks\u00a0\u2013 using the content of the essays as ammunition, while electrodes monitored the subject's physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects' expressions of anger and rage were later played back to them repeatedly.[24]\nThe experiment lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week.[25][26] Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study.[27]\nKaczynski's lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to his participation in Murray's study.[24] Some sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of Project MKUltra, the Central Intelligence Agency's research into mind control.[28][29][30] Chase[31][32] and others[33][34] have also suggested that this experience may have motivated Kaczynski's criminal activities.\nIn 1962, Kaczynski enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he earned his master's and doctoral degrees in mathematics in 1964 and 1967, respectively. Michigan was not his first choice for postgraduate education; he had also applied to the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago, both of which accepted him but offered him no teaching position or financial aid. Michigan offered him an annual grant of $2,310 (equivalent to $19,343 in 2018) and a teaching post.[23]\nAt the University of Michigan, Kaczynski specialized in complex analysis, specifically geometric function theory. His intellect and drive impressed his professors. \"He was an unusual person. He was not like the other graduate students. He was much more focused about his work. He had a drive to discover mathematical truth,\" said professor Peter Duren. \"It is not enough to say he was smart,\" said George Piranian, another of his Michigan mathematics professors.[35] At Michigan, Kaczynski earned 5 Bs and 12 As in his 18 courses. However, in 2006, he said his \"memories of the University of Michigan are NOT pleasant\u00a0... the fact that I not only passed my courses (except one physics course) but got quite a few As, shows how wretchedly low the standards were at Michigan.\"[23]\nIn 1967, Kaczynski's dissertation Boundary Functions[36] won the Sumner B. Myers Prize for Michigan's best mathematics dissertation of the year.[8] Allen Shields, his doctoral advisor, called it \"the best I have ever directed\",[23] and Maxwell Reade, a member of his dissertation committee, said \"I would guess that maybe 10 or 12 men in the country understood or appreciated it.\"[35][8] Kaczynski published two journal articles related to his dissertation, and three more after leaving Michigan.[36][37]\nIn late 1967, the 25-year-old Kaczynski became the youngest assistant professor of mathematics in the history of University of California, Berkeley up to that time, where he taught undergraduate courses in geometry and calculus.[38] His teaching evaluations suggest he was not well-liked by his students: he seemed uncomfortable teaching, taught straight from the textbook and refused to answer questions.[8] Without any explanation, Kaczynski resigned on June 30, 1969.[39] At the time, the chairman of the mathematics department, J.\u00a0W. Addison, called this a \"sudden and unexpected\" resignation.[40][41]\nIn 1996, vice chairman at Berkeley, Calvin C. Moore said, given Kaczynski's \"impressive\" dissertation and publications, he \"could have advanced up the ranks and been a senior member of the faculty today.\"[42] A 1996 Los Angeles Times article stated: \"The field that Kaczynski worked in doesn't really exist today [according to mathematicians interviewed about his work]. Most of its theories were proven in the 1960s, when Kaczynski worked in it.\" According to mathematician Donald Rung, \"[Kaczynski] probably would have gone on to some other area if he were to stay in mathematics.\"[39]\nAfter resigning from Berkeley, Kaczynski moved to his parents' home in Lombard, Illinois, then two years later, in 1971, to a remote cabin he had built outside Lincoln, Montana, where he could live a simple life with little money and without electricity or running water,[43] working odd jobs and receiving some financial support from his family.[8]\nHis original goal was to become self-sufficient so that he could live autonomously. He taught himself survival skills such as tracking game, edible plant identification, organic farming, bow drilling and other primitive technologies.[44] He used an old bicycle to get to town, and a volunteer at the local library said he visited frequently to read classic works in their original languages. Other Lincoln residents said later that such a lifestyle was not unusual in the area.[45]\nKaczynski decided it was impossible to live peacefully in nature because of the destruction of the wildland around his cabin by real estate development and industrial projects.[44] In response, he began performing acts of sabotage against nearby developments in 1975,[46] and dedicated himself to reading about sociology and political philosophy, such as the works of Jacques Ellul.\nIn an interview after his arrest, he recalled being shocked on a hike to one of his favorite wild spots:[44]\nIt's kind of rolling country, not flat, and when you get to the edge of it you find these ravines that cut very steeply in to cliff-like drop-offs and there was even a waterfall there. It was about a two days' hike from my cabin. That was the best spot until the summer of 1983. That summer there were too many people around my cabin so I decided I needed some peace. I went back to the plateau and when I got there I found they had put a road right through the middle of it\u00a0... You just can't imagine how upset I was. It was from that point on I decided that, rather than trying to acquire further wilderness skills, I would work on getting back at the system. Revenge.\nIn that 1999 interview, he described his loss of faith in the potential for reform. He decided that the \"human tendency\u00a0... to take the path of least resistance\" meant that violent collapse was the only way to bring down the industrial-technological system:[44]\nThey'll take the easy way out, and giving up your car, your television set, your electricity, is not the path of least resistance for most people. As I see it, I don't think there is any controlled or planned way in which we can dismantle the industrial system. I think that the only way we will get rid of it is if it breaks down and collapses\u00a0... The big problem is that people don't believe a revolution is possible, and it is not possible precisely because they do not believe it is possible. To a large extent I think the eco-anarchist movement is accomplishing a great deal, but I think they could do it better\u00a0... The real revolutionaries should separate themselves from the reformers\u00a0... And I think that it would be good if a conscious effort was being made to get as many people as possible introduced to the wilderness. In a general way, I think what has to be done is not to try and convince or persuade the majority of people that we are right, as much as try to increase tensions in society to the point where things start to break down. To create a situation where people get uncomfortable enough that they're going to rebel. So the question is how do you increase those tensions?\nBetween 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski mailed or hand-delivered a series of increasingly sophisticated bombs that cumulatively killed three people and injured 23 others. In all, 16 bombs were attributed to Kaczynski. While the bombing devices varied widely through the years, all but the first few contained the initials \"FC\", which Kaczynski later said stood for \"Freedom Club\",[47] inscribed on parts inside. He purposely left misleading clues in the devices and took extreme care in preparing them to avoid leaving fingerprints; latent fingerprints on some of the devices did not match those found on letters attributed to Kaczynski.[a]\nKaczynski's first mail bomb was directed at Buckley Crist, a professor of materials engineering at Northwestern University. On May 25, 1978, a package bearing Crist's return address was found in a parking lot at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The package was \"returned\" to Crist who was suspicious because he had not sent the package, so he contacted campus police. Officer Terry Marker opened the package, which exploded and injured his left hand.[49]\nKaczynski had returned to Illinois for the May 1978 bombing, and stayed there for a time to work with his father and brother at a foam rubber factory. However, in August 1978 he was fired by his brother for writing insulting limericks about a female supervisor whom he had briefly courted.[50][51] The female supervisor later recalled Kaczynski as \"intelligent, quiet,\" but remembered little of their acquaintance and firmly denied they had had any romantic relationship.[52]\nThe initial 1978 bombing was followed by bombs sent to airline officials, and in 1979 a bomb was placed in the cargo hold of American Airlines Flight 444, a Boeing 727 flying from Chicago to Washington, D.C. A faulty timing mechanism prevented the bomb from exploding, but it released smoke, which forced an emergency landing. Authorities said it had enough power to \"obliterate the plane\" had it exploded.[49] As bombing an airliner is a federal crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation became involved, designating the case UNABOM for University and Airline Bomber.\nKaczynski left false clues in every bomb, which he made hard to find to make them believable. The first clue was a metal plate stamped with the initials FC hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe end cap) in every bomb.[48] Another clue included a note left in a bomb that did not detonate; it read \"Wu\u2014It works! I told you it would\u2014RV\".[53] Another clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes.[54] He sent one bomb embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.[49] The FBI theorized that Kaczynski had a theme of nature, trees and wood in his crimes. He often included bits of tree branch and bark in his bombs, and targets selected included Percy Wood and Professor Leroy Wood. Crime writer Robert Graysmith noted that his \"obsession with wood\" was \"a large factor.\"[55]\nThe first serious injury occurred in 1985, when John Hauser, a graduate student and captain in the United States Air Force, lost four fingers and vision in one eye.[56] The bomb, like others of Kaczynski's, was handcrafted and made with wooden parts.[57]\nHugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised as a piece of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to remove it from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body.[b]\nIn 1993, after a six-year break, Kaczynski mailed a bomb to David Gelernter, a computer science professor at Yale University. Though critically injured, Gelernter recovered. In the same weekend, Kaczynski mailed a bomb to the home of Charles Epstein from the University of California, San Francisco, who lost several fingers upon opening it. Kaczynski then called Gelernter's brother, Joel Gelernter, a behavioral geneticist, and told him, \"You are next.\"[59] Geneticist Phillip Sharp at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology received a threatening letter two years later.[60]\nIn 1994, Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas J. Mosser was killed by a mail bomb sent to his home in North Caldwell, New Jersey. In another letter to The New York Times, Kaczynski said he \"blew up Thomas Mosser because ... Burston-Marsteller helped Exxon clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident\" and, more importantly, because \"Its business is the development of techniques for manipulating people's attitudes.\"[61] This was followed by the 1995 murder of Gilbert Brent Murray, president of the timber industry lobbying group California Forestry Association, by a mail bomb addressed to previous president William Dennison, who had retired.[60]\nIn 1995, Kaczynski mailed several letters to media outlets outlining his goals and demanding that his 35,000-word essay Industrial Society and Its Future (dubbed the Unabomber Manifesto by the FBI)[64][65] be printed verbatim by a major newspaper. He stated that, if this demand was met, he would \"desist from terrorism\".[66][67][68]\nThere was controversy as to whether the essay should be published, but Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh recommended its publication out of concern for public safety and in hope that a reader could identify the author. Bob Guccione of Penthouse volunteered to publish it, but Kaczynski replied that Penthouse was less \"respectable\" than the other publications. He said that he would \"reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, after our manuscript has been published\".[69] The New York Times and The Washington Post both published the essay on September 19, 1995.[70][71]\nKaczynski wrote the document on a typewriter (therefore without italics); he capitalized entire words to show emphasis. He always referred to himself as either \"we\" or \"FC\" (\"Freedom Club\"), though there is no evidence that he worked with others. Academic Donald Wayne Foster analyzed the writing at the request of Kaczynski's defense team, and he noted that it contains irregular spelling and hyphenation and other linguistic idiosyncrasies, which led him to conclude that Kaczynski was its author.[72]\nIndustrial Society and Its Future begins with Kaczynski's assertion: \"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.\"[73][74] He writes that technology has had a destabilizing effect on society, has made life unfulfilling, and has caused widespread psychological suffering.[75] He argues that most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits because of technological advances; he calls these \"surrogate activities\" wherein people strive toward artificial goals, including scientific work, consumption of entertainment, and following sports teams.[75] He predicts that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted to meet the needs of the social systems, rather than vice versa.[75] He believes that technological progress can be stopped, unlike people who understand technology's negative effects yet passively accept it as inevitable.[76] He calls for a return to \"wild nature.\"[75]\nKaczynski argues that the erosion of human freedom is a natural product of an industrial society because \"the system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function\", and that reform of the system is impossible because \"changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt the system\".[77] However, he states that the system has not yet fully achieved \"control over human behavior\" and \"is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival\". He predicts that \"if the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. Otherwise it will break down,\" and that \"the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years\".[77] He states that the task of those who oppose industrial society is to promote \"social stress and instability\" and to propagate \"an ideology that opposes technology\", one that offers the \"counter-ideal\" of nature \"in order to gain enthusiastic support\". A \"revolution against technology may be possible\" when industrial society is sufficiently unstable.[78]\nThroughout the document, Kaczynski addresses left-wing politics as a movement. He defines leftists as \"mainly socialists, collectivists, 'politically correct' types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like\",[79] states that leftism is driven primarily by \"feelings of inferiority\" and \"oversocialization\",[75] and derides leftism as \"one of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world\".[79] He additionally states that \"a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must take a resolutely anti-leftist stance and must avoid all collaboration with leftists\", as in his view \"leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature, with human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology\".[73] He also criticizes conservatives, describing them as \"fools\" who \"whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth.\"[79]\nAlston Chase reported in The Atlantic that the text \"was greeted in 1995 by many thoughtful people as a work of genius, or at least profundity, and as quite sane\".[80] Chase argued, however, that it \"is the work of neither a genius nor a maniac.\" \"Its pessimism over the direction of civilization and its rejection of the modern world are shared especially with the country's most highly educated.\"[80] UCLA political science professor James Q. Wilson was mentioned in the manifesto; he wrote in The New Yorker that Industrial Society and Its Future was \"a carefully reasoned, artfully written paper\". \"If it is the work of a madman, then the writings of many political philosophers\u2026 are scarcely more sane.\"[81]\nDavid Skrbina, a philosophy professor at the University of Michigan and a former Green Party candidate for governor of Michigan, has written several essays in support of Kaczynski's ideas, one which is titled \"A Revolutionary for Our Times\".[82][83][84] Paul Kingsnorth, a former deputy-editor of The Ecologist and a co-founder of the Dark Mountain Project, wrote an essay for Orion Magazine in which he described Kaczynski's arguments as \"worryingly convincing\" and stated that they \"may change my life\".[85]\nPsychiatrist Keith Ablow stated on Fox News that Kaczynski was \"reprehensible for murdering and maiming people\" but \"precisely correct in many of his ideas\", and he compared Industrial Society and Its Future to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.[86] Anarcho-primitivist authors such as John Zerzan and John Moore came to Kaczynski's defense while also holding reservations about his actions and ideas.[87][88]\nThe manifesto echoed contemporary critics of technology and industrialization such as John Zerzan, Jacques Ellul,[89] Rachel Carson, Lewis Mumford, and E. F. Schumacher.[90] \nIts idea of the \"disruption of the power process\" similarly echoed social critics emphasizing the lack of meaningful work as a primary cause of social problems, including Mumford, Paul Goodman, and Eric Hoffer.[90] Its general theme was also addressed by Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, to which Kaczynski refers in the text.[91] Kaczynski's ideas of \"oversocialization\" and \"surrogate activities\" recall Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents and its theories of rationalization and sublimation (a term which Kaczynski uses three times to describe \"surrogate activities\").[92]\nBill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, wrote that Kaczynski is \"clearly a Luddite\", but \"simply saying this does not dismiss his argument\".[93] Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks,[94] published a manifesto and copied large portions from Industrial Society and Its Future, with certain terms substituted (e.g., replacing \"leftists\" with \"cultural Marxists\" and \"multiculturalists\").[95][96][97]\nOver twenty years after Kaczynski's imprisonment, his views have inspired online communities of primitivists and neo-Luddites. One explanation for the renewal of interest in his views is the television series Manhunt: Unabomber, which aired in 2017.[98] Kaczynski is also frequently referenced by ecofascists online.[99]\nUniversity of Michigan\u2013Dearborn philosophy professor David Skrbina helped to compile Kaczynski's work into the 2010 anthology Technological Slavery, including the original manifesto, letters between Skrbina and Kaczynski, and other essays.[100] Kaczynski updated his 1995 manifesto as Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How to address advances in computers and the Internet. He advocates practicing other types of protest and makes no mention of violence.[101]\nBecause of the material used to make the mail bombs, the suspect was labeled the \"Junkyard Bomber\" by U.S. Postal Inspectors, who initially had responsibility for the case.[102] FBI Inspector Terry D. Turchie was appointed to run the UNABOM investigation.[103] In 1979, an FBI-led task force that included 125 agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and U.S. Postal Inspection Service was formed.[103] The task force grew to more than 150 full-time personnel, but minute analysis of recovered components of the bombs and the investigation into the lives of the victims proved of little use in identifying the suspect, who built his bombs primarily from scrap materials available almost anywhere. The victims, investigators later learned, were chosen irregularly from library research.\nIn 1980, chief agent John Douglas, working with agents in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a psychological profile of the unidentified bomber. It described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence and connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983. An alternative theory was developed by FBI analysts that concentrated on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic.[104] A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take calls related to the investigation, with a $1\u00a0million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.[105]\nBefore the publication of Industrial Society and Its Future, Ted's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife to follow up on suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber.[106] David was dismissive at first, but he began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He searched through old family papers and found letters dating to the 1970s that Ted had sent to newspapers to protest the abuses of technology using phrasing similar to the manifesto.[107]\nBefore the manifesto's publication, the FBI held many press conferences asking the public to help identify the Unabomber. They were convinced that the bomber was from the Chicago area where he began his bombings, had worked in or had some connection to Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s had some association with the San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical information, as well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire text of the manifesto was published, persuaded David's wife to urge her husband to read the manifesto.[108][109]\nAfter the manifesto was published, the FBI received over a thousand calls a day for months in response to its offer of a $1\u00a0million reward for information leading to the identification of the Unabomber. Many letters claiming to be from the Unabomber were also sent to the UNABOM Task Force, and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, Kaczynski's brother David hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly.[110] David later hired Washington, D.C. attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize the evidence acquired by Swanson and make contact with the FBI, given the presumed difficulty of attracting the FBI's attention. David wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, such as the Ruby Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he feared a violent outcome from any attempt by the FBI to contact his brother.[111]\nIn early 1996, former FBI hostage negotiator and criminal profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt to compare the manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.[111]\nIn February 1996, Bisceglie gave a copy of the 1971 essay written by Ted Kaczynski to Molly Flynn at the FBI.[103] She forwarded the essay to the San Francisco-based task force. FBI Profiler James R. Fitzgerald[112][113] recognized similarities in the writings using linguistic analysis and determined that the author of the essays and the manifesto were almost certainly the same. Combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, the analysis provided the basis for a search warrant signed by Terry Turchie, the head of the entire investigation.[103]\nDavid Kaczynski had tried to remain anonymous, but he was soon identified, and within a few days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with behavioral analysis Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, whom he met many times in Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.[114]\nDavid had once admired and emulated his older brother but later decided to leave the survivalist lifestyle behind.[115] He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified.[115]\nFBI officials were not unanimous in identifying Ted as the author of the manifesto. The search warrant noted that numerous experts believed the manifesto had been written by another individual.[48]\nFBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, where he was found in an unkempt state. A search of his cabin revealed a cache of bomb components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of the Unabomber crimes and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found what appeared to be the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future.[116] By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history.[117][118]\nAfter his capture, theories emerged naming Kaczynski as the Zodiac Killer. Among the links that raised suspicion was the fact that Kaczynski lived in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1967 to 1969 (the same period that most of the Zodiac's confirmed killings occurred in California), that both individuals were highly intelligent with an interest in bombs and codes, and that both wrote letters to newspapers demanding the publication of their works with the threat of continued violence if the demand was not met. However, Kaczynski's whereabouts could not be verified for all of the killings, and the gun and knife murders committed by the Zodiac Killer differ from Kaczynski's bombings, so he was not further pursued as a suspect. Robert Graysmith, author of the 1986 book Zodiac, said the similarities are \"fascinating\" but purely coincidental.[119]\nThe early hunt for the Unabomber portrayed a perpetrator far different from the eventual suspect. Industrial Society and Its Future consistently uses \"we\" and \"our\" throughout, and at one point in 1993 investigators sought an individual whose first name was \"Nathan\" because the name was imprinted on the envelope of a letter sent to the media.[53] When the case was presented to the public, authorities denied that there was ever anyone other than Kaczynski involved in the crimes.[106]\nA federal grand jury indicted Kaczynski in April 1996 on ten counts of illegally transporting, mailing, and using bombs, and three counts of murder.[120]\nKaczynski's lawyers, headed by Montana federal public defenders Michael Donahoe and Judy Clarke, attempted to enter an insanity defense to avoid the death penalty, but Kaczynski rejected this strategy. On January 8, 1998, he requested to dismiss his lawyers and hire Tony Serra as his counsel; Serra had agreed not to use an insanity defense and instead base a defense on Kaczynski's anti-technology views.[121][122][123] This request was unsuccessful and Kaczynski subsequently tried to commit suicide by hanging on January 9.[124] Several, though not all, forensic psychiatrists and psychologists who examined Kaczynski diagnosed him as having paranoid schizophrenia. Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz said Kaczynski was not psychotic but had a schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder.[125] In his 2010 book Technological Slavery, Kaczynski said that two prison psychologists who visited him frequently for four years told him they saw no indication that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and the diagnosis was \"ridiculous\" and a \"political diagnosis\".[126]\nOn January 21, 1998, Kaczynski was declared competent to stand trial \"despite the psychiatric diagnoses\".[127][128] As he was fit to stand trial, prosecutors sought the death penalty but Kaczynski avoided that by pleading guilty to all charges on January 22, 1998, and accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. He later tried to withdraw this plea, arguing it was involuntary. Judge Garland Ellis Burrell Jr. denied his request, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld that decision.[129]\nIn 2006, Burrell ordered that items from Kaczynski's cabin be sold at a \"reasonably advertised Internet auction.\" Items considered to be bomb-making materials, such as diagrams and \"recipes\" for bombs, were excluded. The net proceeds went towards the $15\u00a0million in restitution Burrell had awarded Kaczynski's victims.[130]\nKaczynski's correspondence and other personal papers were also auctioned.[131][132][133] Burrell ordered the removal, before sale, of references in those documents to Kaczynski's victims; Kaczynski unsuccessfully challenged those redactions as a violation of his freedom of speech.[134][135][136] The auction raised $232,000.[137]\nKaczynski is serving eight life sentences without the possibility of parole at ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.[134][138] When asked in 1999 if he was afraid of losing his mind in prison, Kaczynski replied:\nNo, what worries me is that I might in a sense adapt to this environment and come to be comfortable here and not resent it anymore. And I am afraid that as the years go by that I may forget, I may begin to lose my memories of the mountains and the woods and that's what really worries me, that I might lose those memories, and lose that sense of contact with wild nature in general. But I am not afraid they are going to break my spirit.[44]\nIn 2016, it was reported that early on in his imprisonment Kaczynski had befriended Ramzi Yousef and Timothy McVeigh, the perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing, respectively. The trio discussed religion and politics and formed a friendship which lasted until McVeigh's execution in 2001.[139]\nKaczynski's cabin was seized by the U.S. government and was on display at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.[140]\nIn October 2005, Kaczynski offered to donate two rare books to the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies at Northwestern University's campus in Evanston, Illinois, the location of his first two attacks. Northwestern rejected the offer due to already having copies of the works.[141]\nThe Labadie Collection, part of the University of Michigan's Special Collections Library, houses Kaczynski's correspondence with over 400 people since his arrest, including replies, legal documents, publications, and clippings.[142][143] His writings are among the most popular selections in the University of Michigan's special collections.[100] The identity of most correspondents will remain sealed until 2049.[142][144]\nIn 2012, Kaczynski responded to the Harvard Alumni Association's directory inquiry for the fiftieth reunion of the class of 1962; he listed his occupation as \"prisoner\" and his eight life sentences as \"awards\".[145]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nHugh Michael Jackman AC (born 12 October 1968)[1] is an Australian actor, singer, and producer. He is best known for playing Wolverine in the X-Men film series from 2000 to 2018, a role for which he holds the Guinness World Record for \"longest career as a live-action Marvel superhero\". Jackman is also recognised for his lead roles in films such as the romantic comedy Kate & Leopold (2001), the action film Van Helsing (2004), the drama The Prestige (2006), the fantasy drama The Fountain (2006), the period romance Australia (2008), the film version of Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012), the thriller Prisoners (2013), and the musical The Greatest Showman (2017), for which he received a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album. For playing Jean Valjean in Les Mis\u00e9rables, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In Broadway theatre, Jackman won the 2004 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his role in The Boy from Oz. A four-time host of the Tony Awards, he won an Emmy Award for hosting the 2005 ceremony. He also hosted the 81st Academy Awards in 2009. Jackman was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours for services to performing arts and to the global community. Jackman was born in Sydney, New South Wales, to Grace McNeil (n\u00e9e Greenwood) and Christopher John Jackman, a Cambridge-educated accountant.[2][3] His parents were English and had come to Australia in 1967 as part of the \"Ten Pound Poms\" immigration.[3] Thus, in addition to his Australian citizenship, Jackman holds British citizenship by virtue of being born to UK-born parents.[4][5] One of his paternal great-grandfathers, Nicholas Isidor Bellas, was Greek,[6][7] from the Ottoman Empire (now in Greece).[8][9] His parents were devout Christians, having been converted by Evangelist Billy Graham after their marriage.[3] Jackman has four older siblings and was the second of his parents' children to be born in Australia.[10] He also has a younger half-sister, from his mother's remarriage.[11] His parents divorced when he was eight, and Jackman remained in Australia with his father and two brothers, while his mother moved back to England with Jackman's two sisters.[3][12][13] As a child, Jackman liked the outdoors, spending a lot of time at the beach and on camping trips and school holidays all over Australia. He wanted to see the world saying, \"I used to spend nights looking at atlases. I decided I wanted to be a chef on a plane. Because I'd been on a plane and there was food on board, I presumed there was a chef. I thought that would be an ideal job.\"[14] Jackman went to primary school at Pymble Public School and later attended the all-boys Knox Grammar School on Sydney's Upper North Shore, where he starred in its production of My Fair Lady in 1985 and became the school captain in 1986.[15] Following graduation, he spent a gap year working at Uppingham School in England as a Physical Education teacher.[16][17] On his return, he studied at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating in 1991 with a BA in Communications.[18] In his final year of university, he took a drama course to make up additional credits. The class did V\u00e1clav Havel's The Memorandum with Jackman as the lead.[10] He later commented, \"In that week I felt more at home with those people than I did in the entire three years [at university]\".[19] After obtaining his BA, Jackman completed the one-year course \"The Journey\" at the Actors' Centre in Sydney.[10] About studying acting full-time, he stated, \"It wasn't until I was 22 that I ever thought about my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always had an interest in theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'.\"[20] After completing \"The Journey\", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down[21] to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.[22] Jackman has said he \"always loved acting but when I started at drama school I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn't coming right to me. Everyone was cooler, everyone seemed more likely to succeed, everyone seemed more natural at it and in retrospect, I think that is good. I think it is good to come from behind as an actor. I think it is good to go into an audition thinking, 'Man I've got to be at my best to get this gig.'\"[23] He has cited actor Gary Oldman as an inspiration, personally thanking him on a 2017 edition of The Graham Norton Show.[24] On the night of his final Academy graduation performance, Jackman received a phone call offering him a role on Correlli: \"I was technically unemployed for thirteen seconds.\" Correlli, devised by Australian actress Denise Roberts, was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman's first major professional job, and where he met his future wife Deborra-Lee Furness. \"Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it,\" he said,[20] as the show lasted only one season. After Correlli Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne. In 1996, Jackman played Gaston in the local Walt Disney production of Beauty and the Beast, and Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard.[10] During his stage musical career in Melbourne, he starred in the 1998 Midsumma festival cabaret production Summa Cabaret. He also hosted Melbourne's Carols by Candlelight and Sydney's Carols in the Domain. Jackman's early film works include Erskineville Kings and Paperback Hero (1999), and his television work includes Law of the Land, Halifax f.p., Blue Heelers, and Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River. Jackman became known outside Australia in 1998, when he played the leading role of Curly in the Royal National Theatre's acclaimed stage production of Oklahoma!, in London's West End.[10] The performance earned him an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Jackman said, \"I totally felt like it can't get any better than this. On some level that production will be one of the highlights of my career.\"[25] He also starred in the 1999 film version of the same stage musical, which has been screened in many countries. Jackman had his breakthrough role playing Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000)\u2014a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name.[26] Co-starring Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Famke Janssen and Ian McKellen, the film tells the story of a group of mutants, whose superhuman powers make them distrusted by normal humans. The role was originally written for Russell Crowe who instead suggested Jackman for the part.[27] Jackman says that his wife advised him against taking on the role, as she found it \"ridiculous\".[28] He initially studied wolves to develop his character, as he thought that Wolverine alluded to wolves.[29] X-Men was successful at the box-office, earning US$296 million.[30] The role earned him a Saturn Award for Best Actor.[31] Wolverine was tough for Jackman to portray because he had few lines, but a lot of emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Mad Max 2. \"There were guys who had relatively little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it.\"[32] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. \"We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty.\"[33] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. He said, \"Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned.\"[14] Jackman, at 1.9\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in)[34][35] stands 30\u00a0cm taller than Wolverine, who is said in the original comic book to be 5\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.60\u00a0m).[36] Hence, the filmmakers were frequently forced to shoot Jackman at unusual angles or only from the waist up to make him appear shorter than he actually is, and his co-stars wore platform soles. Jackman was also required to add a great deal of muscle for the role, and in preparing for the fourth film in the series, he bench-pressed over 136\u00a0kg (300\u00a0lb).[37] Jackman reprised his role in 2003's X2, 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand, and the 2009 prequel X-Men Origins: Wolverine, where Troye Sivan played the younger version of James Howlett. He also cameoed as Wolverine in 2011's X-Men: First Class. He returned for the role of Wolverine again in 2013's The Wolverine, a stand-alone sequel taking place after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, and reprised the character in the 2014 sequel X-Men: Days of Future Past and briefly in the 2016 follow-up X-Men: Apocalypse.[38] In 2015, Jackman announced that the 2017 sequel to The Wolverine, Logan, was the final time that he would play the role.[39] It earned him the Guinness World Record of 'longest career as a live-action Marvel superhero'.[40] Jackman starred as Leopold in the 2001 romantic comedy film Kate & Leopold, a role for which he received a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination.[10] Jackman plays a Victorian English duke who accidentally time-travels to 21st-century Manhattan, where he meets Kate (Meg Ryan), a cynical advertising executive. In 2001, Jackman also starred in the action/drama Swordfish with John Travolta and Halle Berry. This was the second time Jackman worked with Berry, and the two have worked together thrice more in the X-Men movies. He hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in 2001. In 2002, Jackman sang the role of Billy Bigelow in the musical Carousel in a special concert performance at Carnegie Hall with the Orchestra of St. Luke's. In 2004, Jackman won the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical for his 2003\u20132004 Broadway portrayal of Australian songwriter and performer Peter Allen in the hit musical The Boy from Oz, which he also performed in Australia in 2006.[10] In addition, Jackman hosted the Tony Awards in 2003, 2004, and 2005, garnering positive reviews. His hosting of the 2004 Tony Awards earned him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performer in a Variety, Musical or Comedy program. After 2003's X2, Jackman played the title role of monster killer Gabriel Van Helsing in the 2004 film Van Helsing.[10] Jackman and the film were noted in Bruce A. McClelland's book Slayers and Their Vampires: A Cultural History of Killing the Dead. Jackman was asked to consider taking on the role as James Bond before Daniel Craig was chosen to play the character, but turned it down due to other commitments. Speaking to the British Press Association in 2011, Jackman said: 'I was about to shoot X-Men 2 and Wolverine had become this thing in my life and I didn't want to be doing two such iconic characters at once.'[41][42][43] Alongside Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson, Jackman starred in The Prestige (2006), a mystery thriller from Christopher Nolan. Jackman portrayed Robert Angier, an aristocratic magician who builds up a rivalry with contemporary Alfred Borden (Bale) in attempt to one-up each other in the art of deception. After reading the script, Jackman expressed interest in starring in the film, and Nolan believed that the actor had the qualities of the character.[44] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock.[45] The Prestige was acclaimed and a box-office success.[46][47] Jackman portrayed three different characters in Darren Aronofsky's science-fiction film The Fountain: Tommy Creo, a neuroscientist, who is torn between his wife, Izzi (Rachel Weisz), who is dying of a brain tumor, and his work at trying to cure her; Captain Tomas Creo, a Spanish conquistador in 1532 Seville; and a future astronaut, Tom, travelling to a golden nebula in an eco-spacecraft seeking to be reunited with Izzi. Jackman said The Fountain was his most difficult film thus far due to the physical and emotional demands of the part. Jackman also starred in Woody Allen's 2006 film Scoop opposite Scarlett Johansson. That year he also reprised the role of Wolverine in X-Men: The Last Stand. He rounded out 2006 with two animated films: Happy Feet, directed by George Miller, in which he voiced the part of Memphis, an emperor penguin; and Flushed Away, where Jackman supplied the voice of a rat named Roddy who ends up being flushed down a family's toilet into the London sewer system. Flushed Away co-starred Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (Jackman's fourth time working with him). In 2007, Jackman produced and guest-starred in the television musical-dramedy series Viva Laughlin, which was cancelled by CBS after two episodes. In 2008, director Baz Luhrmann cast Jackman to replace Russell Crowe as the male lead in his much-publicized epic film, Australia, which co-starred Nicole Kidman. The movie was released in late November 2008 in Australia and the U.S. Jackman played a tough, independent cattle drover, who reluctantly helps an English noblewoman in her quest to save both her philandering husband's Australian cattle station and the mixed race Aboriginal child she finds there. Of the movie, Jackman said, \"This is pretty much one of those roles that had me pinching myself all the way through the shoot. I got to shoot a big-budget, shamelessly old-fashioned romantic epic set against one of the most turbulent times in my native country's history, while, at the same time, celebrating that country's natural beauty, its people, its cultures... I'll die a happy man knowing I've got this film on my CV.\"[48] That year, People Magazine named Jackman its 2008 \"Sexiest Man Alive.[49] Jackman co-starred with Daniel Craig on Broadway at the Schoenfeld Theatre in a limited engagement of the play A Steady Rain, which ran from 10 September 2009, to 6 December 2009.[50] Jackman has reprised his role as the Wolverine in X-Men spin-off films. Jackman starred in X-Men Origins: Wolverine which opened in 2009 and later starred in 2013's The Wolverine. Jackman made a cameo appearance as Wolverine in X-Men: First Class in 2011. Jackman had a one-man show at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco from 3\u201315 May 2011.[51] The production was a mixture of his favourite Broadway and Hollywood musical numbers, backed by a 17-piece orchestra, from shows including Oklahoma and The Boy from Oz. The show had a run-time of approximately 100\u00a0minutes, and also included slide shows of Jackman's youth, family, and work, as well as some one-on-one interaction with the audience. Jackman was backed by fellow musical theatre veterans Merle Dandridge and Angel Reda.[52][53] He later returned to Broadway in a new show, Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre, which began performances on 25 October 2011 and concluded on 1 January 2012.[54] In a November 2012 release, Jackman voiced the role of E.Aster Bunnymund (the Easter Bunny) in the animated film Rise of the Guardians.[55] Jackman starred as Jean Valjean in the film Les Mis\u00e9rables, an adaptation of the musical. The film opened on 25 December 2012.[56][57][58] For the role, he lost 15\u00a0pounds and later had to regain 30\u00a0pounds to mirror his character's newfound success.[59] He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy in January 2013 for this performance and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.[60] Jackman appeared alongside Kate Winslet in Movie 43, an ensemble comedy, in January 2013.[61] Jackman (along with actress Kristen Wiig) was featured on \"You've Got the Look\", a song by comedy hip hop group The Lonely Island on their third album, The Wack Album, released in June 2013. Jackman returned to Broadway in the new play, The River, which ran at the Circle in the Square Theatre from October 2014 to February 2015.[62] In November and December 2015, Jackman made a national tour of Australia with his show Broadway to Oz. He performed a range of songs from Broadway musicals, from Les Mis\u00e9rables to a Peter Allen tribute (including classics such as \"I Still Call Australia Home\"), with his 150-piece orchestra, choir, and backup dancers.[63] The show began at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena and proceeded to Qantas Credit Union Arena, Brisbane Entertainment Centre, the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, and the Perth Arena. Jackman then portrayed the villain Blackbeard in the film Pan, which revolved around the backstories of J.M. Barrie's characters Peter Pan and Captain Hook. The movie received generally negative reviews and was a failure at the box office.[64] In 2016, Jackman played fictional ski coach, Bronson Peary, in Eddie the Eagle,[65] which portrayed how Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping in 1988.[66] Jackman had an uncredited cameo as Wolverine in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse.[67] In 2017, he reprised the character for the final time in the third Wolverine film, Logan.[68] Jackman's performance and the film were critically acclaimed and it is regarded as one of the greatest superhero films of all-time.[69] For his 17-year spanning long performance as Wolverine, Jackman topped The Hollywood Reporter's Greatest Superhero Movie Performances of All Time list.[70] That year, he also starred as P. T. Barnum in the musical The Greatest Showman.[71] He received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination for the film, his third Golden Globe nomination, and also received a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album.[72] In 2018, he starred as American senator, Gary Hart, in Jason Reitman's political drama film, The Front Runner, which chronicled the rise of Hart, a Democratic presidential candidate in 1988, and his subsequent fall from grace when media reports surfaced of his extramarital affair. In 2019, he voiced the character, Sir Lionel Frost, in the animated film, Missing Link. In 2019 Jackman went on his first world tour called, The Man. The Music. The Show., to perform songs from the album, The Greatest Showman: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, and Broadway/Hollywood musical numbers.[73] Comprising 88 shows, the tour visits North America, Europe, and Oceania. It began on May 7, 2019, in Glasgow, Scotland and concludes on October 15, 2019, in San Antonio, United States.[74] In the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours, Jackman was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia, for \"eminent service to the performing arts as an acclaimed actor and performer, and to the global community, particularly as an advocate for poverty eradication.\"[75][76] He will return to Broadway in a revival of The Music Man, playing Harold Hill, which is set to begin previews in September 2020 and open in October 2020.[77][78][79] He will also star in the comedy drama, Bad Education.[80] In 2005, Jackman joined with longtime assistant John Palermo to form a production company, Seed Productions, whose first project was Viva Laughlin in 2007. Jackman's wife Deborra-Lee Furness is also involved in the company, and Palermo had three rings made with a \"unity\" inscription for himself, Furness, and Jackman.[81] Jackman said, \"I'm very lucky in the partners I work with in my life, Deb and John Palermo. It really works. We all have different strengths. I love it. It's very exciting.\"[82] Jackman married Deborra-Lee Furness on 11 April 1996, at St. John's in Toorak, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne.[83] They met on the set of Australian TV show Correlli.[84] Jackman personally designed an engagement ring for Furness, and their wedding rings bore the Sanskrit inscription \"Om paramar mainamar\", translated as \"we dedicate our union to a greater source\".[85] Furness had two miscarriages,[86] following which she and Jackman adopted two children, Oscar[87] and Ava.[88][89] Jackman has described himself as a Christian and a \"religious person\".[90] He meditates daily and follows the spiritually eclectic School of Practical Philosophy.[91] In November 2013, Jackman announced he had basal-cell carcinoma removed from his nose.[92] He had a second carcinoma removed from his nose in May 2014, telling Associated Press that he expects to have future recurrences.[93] This resulted in Jackman attending the various worldwide premieres of X-Men: Days of Future Past with a bandage on his nose, and urging his followers on Instagram to \"wear sunscreen\".[94] On 18 March 2015, Jackman revealed that he had to cancel stage performances in Turkey because he had a left vocal cord hemorrhage.[95][96] As a philanthropist, Jackman is a longtime proponent of microcredit \u2013 the extension of very small loans to prospective entrepreneurs in impoverished countries.

Jackman was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours for services to performing arts and to the global community.\nJackman was born in Sydney, New South Wales, to Grace McNeil (n\u00e9e Greenwood) and Christopher John Jackman, a Cambridge-educated accountant.[2][3] His parents were English and had come to Australia in 1967 as part of the \"Ten Pound Poms\" immigration.[3] Thus, in addition to his Australian citizenship, Jackman holds British citizenship by virtue of being born to UK-born parents.[4][5] One of his paternal great-grandfathers, Nicholas Isidor Bellas, was Greek,[6][7] from the Ottoman Empire (now in Greece).[8][9] His parents were devout Christians, having been converted by Evangelist Billy Graham after their marriage.[3] Jackman has four older siblings and was the second of his parents' children to be born in Australia.[10] He also has a younger half-sister, from his mother's remarriage.[11] His parents divorced when he was eight, and Jackman remained in Australia with his father and two brothers, while his mother moved back to England with Jackman's two sisters.[3][12][13] As a child, Jackman liked the outdoors, spending a lot of time at the beach and on camping trips and school holidays all over Australia. He wanted to see the world saying, \"I used to spend nights looking at atlases. I decided I wanted to be a chef on a plane. Because I'd been on a plane and there was food on board, I presumed there was a chef. I thought that would be an ideal job.\"[14]\nJackman went to primary school at Pymble Public School and later attended the all-boys Knox Grammar School on Sydney's Upper North Shore, where he starred in its production of My Fair Lady in 1985 and became the school captain in 1986.[15] Following graduation, he spent a gap year working at Uppingham School in England as a Physical Education teacher.[16][17] On his return, he studied at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating in 1991 with a BA in Communications.[18] In his final year of university, he took a drama course to make up additional credits. The class did V\u00e1clav Havel's The Memorandum with Jackman as the lead.[10] He later commented, \"In that week I felt more at home with those people than I did in the entire three years [at university]\".[19]\nAfter obtaining his BA, Jackman completed the one-year course \"The Journey\" at the Actors' Centre in Sydney.[10] About studying acting full-time, he stated, \"It wasn't until I was 22 that I ever thought about my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always had an interest in theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'.\"[20] After completing \"The Journey\", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down[21] to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.[22]\nJackman has said he \"always loved acting but when I started at drama school I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn't coming right to me. Everyone was cooler, everyone seemed more likely to succeed, everyone seemed more natural at it and in retrospect, I think that is good. I think it is good to come from behind as an actor. I think it is good to go into an audition thinking, 'Man I've got to be at my best to get this gig.'\"[23] He has cited actor Gary Oldman as an inspiration, personally thanking him on a 2017 edition of The Graham Norton Show.[24]\nOn the night of his final Academy graduation performance, Jackman received a phone call offering him a role on Correlli: \"I was technically unemployed for thirteen seconds.\" Correlli, devised by Australian actress Denise Roberts, was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman's first major professional job, and where he met his future wife Deborra-Lee Furness. \"Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it,\" he said,[20] as the show lasted only one season. After Correlli Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne. In 1996, Jackman played Gaston in the local Walt Disney production of Beauty and the Beast, and Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard.[10] During his stage musical career in Melbourne, he starred in the 1998 Midsumma festival cabaret production Summa Cabaret. He also hosted Melbourne's Carols by Candlelight and Sydney's Carols in the Domain. Jackman's early film works include Erskineville Kings and Paperback Hero (1999), and his television work includes Law of the Land, Halifax f.p., Blue Heelers, and Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River.\nJackman became known outside Australia in 1998, when he played the leading role of Curly in the Royal National Theatre's acclaimed stage production of Oklahoma!, in London's West End.[10] The performance earned him an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Jackman said, \"I totally felt like it can't get any better than this. On some level that production will be one of the highlights of my career.\"[25] He also starred in the 1999 film version of the same stage musical, which has been screened in many countries.\nJackman had his breakthrough role playing Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men (2000)\u2014a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name.[26] Co-starring Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Famke Janssen and Ian McKellen, the film tells the story of a group of mutants, whose superhuman powers make them distrusted by normal humans. The role was originally written for Russell Crowe who instead suggested Jackman for the part.[27] Jackman says that his wife advised him against taking on the role, as she found it \"ridiculous\".[28] He initially studied wolves to develop his character, as he thought that Wolverine alluded to wolves.[29] X-Men was successful at the box-office, earning US$296 million.[30] The role earned him a Saturn Award for Best Actor.[31]\nWolverine was tough for Jackman to portray because he had few lines, but a lot of emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Mad Max 2. \"There were guys who had relatively little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it.\"[32] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. \"We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty.\"[33] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. He said, \"Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned.\"[14]\nJackman, at 1.9\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in)[34][35] stands 30\u00a0cm taller than Wolverine, who is said in the original comic book to be 5\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.60\u00a0m).[36] Hence, the filmmakers were frequently forced to shoot Jackman at unusual angles or only from the waist up to make him appear shorter than he actually is, and his co-stars wore platform soles. Jackman was also required to add a great deal of muscle for the role, and in preparing for the fourth film in the series, he bench-pressed over 136\u00a0kg (300\u00a0lb).[37]\nJackman reprised his role in 2003's X2, 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand, and the 2009 prequel X-Men Origins: Wolverine, where Troye Sivan played the younger version of James Howlett. He also cameoed as Wolverine in 2011's X-Men: First Class. He returned for the role of Wolverine again in 2013's The Wolverine, a stand-alone sequel taking place after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, and reprised the character in the 2014 sequel X-Men: Days of Future Past and briefly in the 2016 follow-up X-Men: Apocalypse.[38] In 2015, Jackman announced that the 2017 sequel to The Wolverine, Logan, was the final time that he would play the role.[39] It earned him the Guinness World Record of 'longest career as a live-action Marvel superhero'.[40]\nJackman starred as Leopold in the 2001 romantic comedy film Kate &amp; Leopold, a role for which he received a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination.[10] Jackman plays a Victorian English duke who accidentally time-travels to 21st-century Manhattan, where he meets Kate (Meg Ryan), a cynical advertising executive. In 2001, Jackman also starred in the action/drama Swordfish with John Travolta and Halle Berry. This was the second time Jackman worked with Berry, and the two have worked together thrice more in the X-Men movies. He hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in 2001.\nIn 2002, Jackman sang the role of Billy Bigelow in the musical Carousel in a special concert performance at Carnegie Hall with the Orchestra of St. Luke's. In 2004, Jackman won the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical for his 2003\u20132004 Broadway portrayal of Australian songwriter and performer Peter Allen in the hit musical The Boy from Oz, which he also performed in Australia in 2006.[10] In addition, Jackman hosted the Tony Awards in 2003, 2004, and 2005, garnering positive reviews. His hosting of the 2004 Tony Awards earned him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performer in a Variety, Musical or Comedy program.\nAfter 2003's X2, Jackman played the title role of monster killer Gabriel Van Helsing in the 2004 film Van Helsing.[10] Jackman and the film were noted in Bruce A. McClelland's book Slayers and Their Vampires: A Cultural History of Killing the Dead.\nJackman was asked to consider taking on the role as James Bond before Daniel Craig was chosen to play the character, but turned it down due to other commitments. Speaking to the British Press Association in 2011, Jackman said: 'I was about to shoot X-Men 2 and Wolverine had become this thing in my life and I didn't want to be doing two such iconic characters at once.'[41][42][43]\nAlongside Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson, Jackman starred in The Prestige (2006), a mystery thriller from Christopher Nolan. Jackman portrayed Robert Angier, an aristocratic magician who builds up a rivalry with contemporary Alfred Borden (Bale) in attempt to one-up each other in the art of deception. After reading the script, Jackman expressed interest in starring in the film, and Nolan believed that the actor had the qualities of the character.[44] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock.[45] The Prestige was acclaimed and a box-office success.[46][47]\nJackman portrayed three different characters in Darren Aronofsky's science-fiction film The Fountain: Tommy Creo, a neuroscientist, who is torn between his wife, Izzi (Rachel Weisz), who is dying of a brain tumor, and his work at trying to cure her; Captain Tomas Creo, a Spanish conquistador in 1532 Seville; and a future astronaut, Tom, travelling to a golden nebula in an eco-spacecraft seeking to be reunited with Izzi. Jackman said The Fountain was his most difficult film thus far due to the physical and emotional demands of the part.\nJackman also starred in Woody Allen's 2006 film Scoop opposite Scarlett Johansson. That year he also reprised the role of Wolverine in X-Men: The Last Stand. He rounded out 2006 with two animated films: Happy Feet, directed by George Miller, in which he voiced the part of Memphis, an emperor penguin; and Flushed Away, where Jackman supplied the voice of a rat named Roddy who ends up being flushed down a family's toilet into the London sewer system. Flushed Away co-starred Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (Jackman's fourth time working with him).\nIn 2007, Jackman produced and guest-starred in the television musical-dramedy series Viva Laughlin, which was cancelled by CBS after two episodes.\nIn 2008, director Baz Luhrmann cast Jackman to replace Russell Crowe as the male lead in his much-publicized epic film, Australia, which co-starred Nicole Kidman. The movie was released in late November 2008 in Australia and the U.S. Jackman played a tough, independent cattle drover, who reluctantly helps an English noblewoman in her quest to save both her philandering husband's Australian cattle station and the mixed race Aboriginal child she finds there. Of the movie, Jackman said, \"This is pretty much one of those roles that had me pinching myself all the way through the shoot. I got to shoot a big-budget, shamelessly old-fashioned romantic epic set against one of the most turbulent times in my native country's history, while, at the same time, celebrating that country's natural beauty, its people, its cultures... I'll die a happy man knowing I've got this film on my CV.\"[48] That year, People Magazine named Jackman its 2008 \"Sexiest Man Alive.[49]\nJackman co-starred with Daniel Craig on Broadway at the Schoenfeld Theatre in a limited engagement of the play A Steady Rain, which ran from 10 September 2009, to 6 December 2009.[50]\nJackman has reprised his role as the Wolverine in X-Men spin-off films. Jackman starred in X-Men Origins: Wolverine which opened in 2009 and later starred in 2013's The Wolverine. Jackman made a cameo appearance as Wolverine in X-Men: First Class in 2011. Jackman had a one-man show at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco from 3\u201315 May 2011.[51] The production was a mixture of his favourite Broadway and Hollywood musical numbers, backed by a 17-piece orchestra, from shows including Oklahoma and The Boy from Oz. The show had a run-time of approximately 100\u00a0minutes, and also included slide shows of Jackman's youth, family, and work, as well as some one-on-one interaction with the audience. Jackman was backed by fellow musical theatre veterans Merle Dandridge and Angel Reda.[52][53] He later returned to Broadway in a new show, Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre, which began performances on 25 October 2011 and concluded on 1 January 2012.[54]\nIn a November 2012 release, Jackman voiced the role of E.Aster Bunnymund (the Easter Bunny) in the animated film Rise of the Guardians.[55] Jackman starred as Jean Valjean in the film Les Mis\u00e9rables, an adaptation of the musical. The film opened on 25 December 2012.[56][57][58] For the role, he lost 15\u00a0pounds and later had to regain 30\u00a0pounds to mirror his character's newfound success.[59] He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy in January 2013 for this performance and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.[60] Jackman appeared alongside Kate Winslet in Movie 43, an ensemble comedy, in January 2013.[61] Jackman (along with actress Kristen Wiig) was featured on \"You've Got the Look\", a song by comedy hip hop group The Lonely Island on their third album, The Wack Album, released in June 2013.

Barrie's characters Peter Pan and Captain Hook. The movie received generally negative reviews and was a failure at the box office.[64] In 2016, Jackman played fictional ski coach, Bronson Peary, in Eddie the Eagle,[65] which portrayed how Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping in 1988.[66]\nJackman had an uncredited cameo as Wolverine in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse.[67] In 2017, he reprised the character for the final time in the third Wolverine film, Logan.[68] Jackman's performance and the film were critically acclaimed and it is regarded as one of the greatest superhero films of all-time.[69] For his 17-year spanning long performance as Wolverine, Jackman topped The Hollywood Reporter's Greatest Superhero Movie Performances of All Time list.[70] That year, he also starred as P.

Jackman's wife Deborra-Lee Furness is also involved in the company, and Palermo had three rings made with a \"unity\" inscription for himself, Furness, and Jackman.[81] Jackman said, \"I'm very lucky in the partners I work with in my life, Deb and John Palermo. It really works. We all have different strengths. I love it. It's very exciting.\"[82]\nJackman married Deborra-Lee Furness on 11 April 1996, at St. John's in Toorak, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne.[83] They met on the set of Australian TV show Correlli.[84] Jackman personally designed an engagement ring for Furness, and their wedding rings bore the Sanskrit inscription \"Om paramar mainamar\", translated as \"we dedicate our union to a greater source\".[85] Furness had two miscarriages,[86] following which she and Jackman adopted two children, Oscar[87] and Ava.[88][89]\nJackman has described himself as a Christian and a \"religious person\".[90] He meditates daily and follows the spiritually eclectic School of Practical Philosophy.[91]\nIn November 2013, Jackman announced he had basal-cell carcinoma removed from his nose.[92] He had a second carcinoma removed from his nose in May 2014, telling Associated Press that he expects to have future recurrences.[93] This resulted in Jackman attending the various worldwide premieres of X-Men: Days of Future Past with a bandage on his nose, and urging his followers on Instagram to \"wear sunscreen\".[94]\nOn 18 March 2015, Jackman revealed that he had to cancel stage performances in Turkey because he had a left vocal cord hemorrhage.[95][96]\nAs a philanthropist, Jackman is a longtime proponent of microcredit \u2013 the extension of very small loans to prospective entrepreneurs in impoverished countries.

                "text": "no title\n\nSatchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow[1] (born December 19, 1987) is an American journalist. The son of actress Mia Farrow and filmmaker Woody Allen, he is known for writing the 2017 articles in The New Yorker that helped uncover allegations of sexual abuse against film producer Harvey Weinstein. For this reporting, The New Yorker won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, sharing the award with The New York Times. Farrow's subsequent investigations exposed similar allegations against politician Eric Schneiderman, media executive Les Moonves, and Supreme Court of the United States Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He is also known for making regular appearances on the NBC morning program Today. Farrow was born on December 19, 1987 in New York City to actress Mia Farrow and filmmaker Woody Allen.[2][3] His father's family is Jewish, and his mother's family is Catholic.[4] His given name honors National Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige[5] and actress Maureen O'Sullivan, his maternal grandmother. Now known as Ronan, he was given the surname \"Farrow\" to avoid a family with one child named Allen amid Farrows and Previns.[6] As a child, Farrow skipped grades in school and took courses with the Center for Talented Youth.[7] He attended Bard College at Simon's Rock, later transferring to Bard College for a B.A. in philosophy,[8] and becoming the youngest graduate of that institution at age 15.[9][10] In 2009, he received a J.D. from Yale Law School,[10][11] and later passed the New York State Bar examination.[12] From 2001 to 2009, he was a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth,[13] advocating for children and women caught up in the ongoing crisis in Sudan's Darfur region[14] and assisting in fundraising and addressing United Nations affiliated groups in the United States.[14][15] During this time, he also made joint trips to the Darfur region of Sudan with his mother, actress Mia Farrow, who is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[16] He subsequently advocated for the protection of Darfuri refugees.[17] Following on his experiences in Sudan, Farrow was affiliated with the Genocide Intervention Network.[18] During his time at Yale Law School, Farrow interned at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and in the office of the chief counsel at the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, focusing on international human rights law.[17][19] In 2009, Farrow joined the Obama administration as Special Adviser for Humanitarian and NGO Affairs in the Office of the Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.[17][20][21] He was part of a team of officials recruited by the diplomat Richard Holbrooke,[22] for whom Farrow had previously worked as a speechwriter.[23] For the next two years, Farrow was responsible for \"overseeing the U.S. Government's relationships with civil society and nongovernmental actors\" in Afghanistan and Pakistan.[17][20] In 2011, Farrow was appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as her Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues[24] and Director of the State Department's Office of Global Youth Issues.[17] The office's creation was the outcome of a multi-year task-force appointed by Clinton to review the United States' economic and social policies on youth,[25] for which Farrow co-chaired the working group with senior United States Agency for International Development staff member David Barth beginning in 2010.[26][27] Farrow's appointment and the creation of the office were announced by Clinton as part of a refocusing on youth following the Arab Spring revolutions.[28] Farrow was responsible for U.S. youth policy and programming with an aim toward \"empower[ing] young people as economic and civic actors.\"[17] Farrow concluded his term as Special Adviser in 2012, with his policies and programs continuing under his successor.[29] After leaving government, Farrow began a Rhodes Scholarship at Magdalen College, Oxford. He studied toward a Doctor of Philosophy, researching the exploitation of the poor in developing countries and submitted his thesis in October 2018.[30] He has written essays, op-eds, and other pieces for The Guardian,[31] Foreign Policy magazine,[32] The Atlantic,[33] The Wall Street Journal,[34] the Los Angeles Times[35] and other periodicals. In October 2013, Penguin Press acquired Farrow's book, Pandora's Box: How American Military Aid Creates America's Enemies, scheduling it for 2015 publication.[36] From February 2014 through February 2015, Farrow hosted Ronan Farrow Daily, a television news program that aired on MSNBC.[37][38][39][40] Farrow hosted the investigative segment \"Undercover with Ronan Farrow\" on NBC's Today.[41][42] Launched in June 2015,[43] the series was billed as providing Farrow's look at the stories \"you don't see in the headlines every day\", often featuring crowd-sourced story selection and covering topics from the labor rights of nail salon workers to mental healthcare issues to sexual assault on campus.[44][45][46] On May 11, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter published a guest column by Farrow in which he drew comparisons between the long-term absence of journalistic inquiry into the rape allegations leveled against Bill Cosby and the sexual assault allegations levied against Woody Allen by Farrow's sister, Dylan Farrow (who was 7 years old at the time of the alleged assault).[47] Farrow detailed first-hand accounts of journalists, biographers, and major publications purposefully omitting from their work decades of rape allegations targeting Cosby.[48] Similarly, Farrow recounts the efforts of Allen's publicist, Leslee Dart, to mount a media campaign focused on countering Dylan Farrow's allegations, while at the same time vindicating Allen: Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted out by Allen's powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father's sexual relationship with another one of my siblings. Those emails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer\u2014therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points\u2014a self-perpetuating spin machine.[48]Farrow continues, by reiterating his support for Dylan Farrow and expressing his unwavering belief in her allegations: I believe my sister. This was always true as a brother who trusted her, and, even at 5 years old, was troubled by our father's strange behavior around her: climbing into her bed in the middle of the night, forcing her to suck his thumb\u2014behavior that had prompted him to enter into therapy focused on his inappropriate conduct with children prior to the allegations.[48]In closing his guest column, Farrow expresses his view of media culture as one that actively discourages victims of abuse from coming forward.[48] Farrow states that victims are pressured to remain silent by threat of \"having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures\"[48] as well as \"going up against angry fans and angry publicists\".[48] Farrow's regard for Hollywood (and media in general), as represented in his 2016 The Hollywood Reporter guest column, foreshadows his investigation into the alleged misconduct of Harvey Weinstein which would be published the following year. On October 10, 2017, The New Yorker published an investigative article by Farrow detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against film producer Harvey Weinstein five days after The New York Times published the findings of its own investigation into Weinstein. It was subsequently revealed that Farrow originally worked on the story for NBC and that the network decided against airing his initial findings in 2016.[49][50][51] The New Yorker won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for Farrow's reporting, sharing the award with Jodi Kantor and Meghan Twohey at The New York Times.[52] Farrow was included in the Time \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" list in 2018.[53][54] On May 7, 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Farrow and fellow reporter Jane Mayer stating that, during his term in office, the New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and that he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs. Schneiderman resigned within hours of the publication of the article on the following day.[55][56] Mayer and Farrow reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations with photographs of contusions and with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults.[55] Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated that he resigned because they \"effectively prevent me from leading the office's work\".[57] Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman.[58] On July 27, 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Farrow stating that six women had accused media executive and CBS CEO Leslie Moonves of harassment and intimidation, and that dozens more described abuse at his company.[59] On August 23, The New Yorker published an article by Adam Entous and Farrow stating that top aides of the Trump White House circulated a conspiracy memo entitled \"The Echo Chamber\" about Obama aides.[60] On September 14, Farrow and Jane Mayer published information pertaining to an allegation of sexual assault by United States Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.[61] The woman making the allegation was revealed to be professor Christine Blasey Ford, who would go on to testify against Kavanaugh before his successful confirmation. In early 2019, Farrow said he and another journalist received demands from American Media, Inc. that sought to extort or blackmail him.[62] He also investigated the concealment by the MIT Media Lab of its involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, leading to the resignation of the director of the Media Lab, Joi Ito, and an internal investigation by MIT.[63] Farrow voiced minor characters in the English-language versions of two Japanese animated films, From Up on Poppy Hill (2011)[64] and The Wind Rises (2013).[65] He also guest starred as himself on the Netflix comedy series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.[66] Farrow also made an appearance on the ABC talk show The View as a guest co-host on December 3, 2019.[67][68] In 2008, Farrow was awarded Refugees International's McCall-Pierpaoli Humanitarian Award for \"extraordinary service to refugees and displaced people\".[69] In 2009, Farrow was named New York magazine's \"New Activist\" of the year and included on its list of individuals \"on the verge of changing their worlds\".[70] In 2011, Harper's Bazaar listed him as an \"up-and-coming politician\".[17][71] In 2012, he was ranked number one in \"Law and Policy\" on Forbes magazine's \"30 Under 30\" Most Influential People.[72] He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Dominican University of California in 2012.[73] In its 2013 retrospective of men born in its 80 years of publication, Esquire magazine named him the man of the year of his birth.[74] In February 2014, Farrow received the third annual Cronkite Award for \"Excellence in Exploration and Journalism\" from Reach the World, in recognition of his work since 2001, including his being a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth in 2001.[75][76] Some media outlets noted that the award came three days after Ronan Farrow Daily began airing and suggested that the award was therefore not justified.[77][78] Farrow is the recipient of the Stonewall Community Foundation's 2016 Vision Award for his reporting on transgender issues.[79] He was also recognized by the Point Foundation in 2018, receiving the Point Courage Award for his in-depth reporting on #MeToo.[80][81] In July 2018, Farrow won the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association\u2019s Journalist of the Year award.[82] In 2019, he was listed among the 40 Under 40 List put out by Connecticut Magazine.[83] He was also named the Out100 Journalist of the Year.[84] As of August 2019, Farrow resided in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.[85] He publicly identified as part of the LGBT community in 2018.[86] Farrow began dating podcast host and former presidential speech writer Jon Lovett in 2011.[87][88][89] The two became engaged in 2019 after Farrow wrote a proposal to Lovett in the Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators book's draft.[90][91] The couple bought a $1.87 million home in Los Angeles in August 2019.[85] Farrow is estranged from his father, Woody Allen.[92][93] After Allen married Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and Andr\u00e9 Previn, Farrow commented, \"He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression.\"[94] In a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Mia Farrow stated that Ronan could \"possibly\" be the biological child of singer Frank Sinatra, with whom she said she \"never really split up.\"[95][1] In a 2015 CBS Sunday Morning interview, Sinatra's daughter Nancy dismissed the idea that her father is the biological father of Ronan Farrow, calling it \"nonsense\", and said her father had a vasectomy years before Ronan's birth.[96][97] Farrow has refused to discuss DNA, and stated that despite their estrangement, \"Woody Allen, legally, ethically, personally was absolutely a father in our family.\"[98] In a 2018 New York magazine article, Woody Allen said that Farrow may indeed be Sinatra's son: \"In my opinion, he's my child \u2026 I think he is, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. I paid for child support for him for his whole childhood, and I don't think that's very fair if he's not mine.\"[99][100] Books Essays and reporting",

The son of actress Mia Farrow and filmmaker Woody Allen, he is known for writing the 2017 articles in The New Yorker that helped uncover allegations of sexual abuse against film producer Harvey Weinstein. For this reporting, The New Yorker won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, sharing the award with The New York Times. Farrow's subsequent investigations exposed similar allegations against politician Eric Schneiderman, media executive Les Moonves, and Supreme Court of the United States Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He is also known for making regular appearances on the NBC morning program Today.\nFarrow was born on December 19, 1987 in New York City to actress Mia Farrow and filmmaker Woody Allen.[2][3] His father's family is Jewish, and his mother's family is Catholic.[4] His given name honors National Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige[5] and actress Maureen O'Sullivan, his maternal grandmother. Now known as Ronan, he was given the surname \"Farrow\" to avoid a family with one child named Allen amid Farrows and Previns.[6]\nAs a child, Farrow skipped grades in school and took courses with the Center for Talented Youth.[7] He attended Bard College at Simon's Rock, later transferring to Bard College for a B.A. in philosophy,[8] and becoming the youngest graduate of that institution at age 15.[9][10] In 2009, he received a J.D. from Yale Law School,[10][11] and later passed the New York State Bar examination.[12]\nFrom 2001 to 2009, he was a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth,[13] advocating for children and women caught up in the ongoing crisis in Sudan's Darfur region[14] and assisting in fundraising and addressing United Nations affiliated groups in the United States.[14][15] During this time, he also made joint trips to the Darfur region of Sudan with his mother, actress Mia Farrow, who is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[16] He subsequently advocated for the protection of Darfuri refugees.[17] Following on his experiences in Sudan, Farrow was affiliated with the Genocide Intervention Network.[18]\nDuring his time at Yale Law School, Farrow interned at the law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and in the office of the chief counsel at the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, focusing on international human rights law.[17][19]\nIn 2009, Farrow joined the Obama administration as Special Adviser for Humanitarian and NGO Affairs in the Office of the Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.[17][20][21] He was part of a team of officials recruited by the diplomat Richard Holbrooke,[22] for whom Farrow had previously worked as a speechwriter.[23] For the next two years, Farrow was responsible for \"overseeing the U.S. Government's relationships with civil society and nongovernmental actors\" in Afghanistan and Pakistan.[17][20]\nIn 2011, Farrow was appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as her Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues[24] and Director of the State Department's Office of Global Youth Issues.[17] The office's creation was the outcome of a multi-year task-force appointed by Clinton to review the United States' economic and social policies on youth,[25] for which Farrow co-chaired the working group with senior United States Agency for International Development staff member David Barth beginning in 2010.[26][27] Farrow's appointment and the creation of the office were announced by Clinton as part of a refocusing on youth following the Arab Spring revolutions.[28] Farrow was responsible for U.S. youth policy and programming with an aim toward \"empower[ing] young people as economic and civic actors.\"[17] Farrow concluded his term as Special Adviser in 2012, with his policies and programs continuing under his successor.[29]\nAfter leaving government, Farrow began a Rhodes Scholarship at Magdalen College, Oxford. He studied toward a Doctor of Philosophy, researching the exploitation of the poor in developing countries and submitted his thesis in October 2018.[30]\nHe has written essays, op-eds, and other pieces for The Guardian,[31] Foreign Policy magazine,[32] The Atlantic,[33] The Wall Street Journal,[34] the Los Angeles Times[35] and other periodicals. In October 2013, Penguin Press acquired Farrow's book, Pandora's Box: How American Military Aid Creates America's Enemies, scheduling it for 2015 publication.[36] From February 2014 through February 2015, Farrow hosted Ronan Farrow Daily, a television news program that aired on MSNBC.[37][38][39][40]\nFarrow hosted the investigative segment \"Undercover with Ronan Farrow\" on NBC's Today.[41][42] Launched in June 2015,[43] the series was billed as providing Farrow's look at the stories \"you don't see in the headlines every day\", often featuring crowd-sourced story selection and covering topics from the labor rights of nail salon workers to mental healthcare issues to sexual assault on campus.[44][45][46]\nOn May 11, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter published a guest column by Farrow in which he drew comparisons between the long-term absence of journalistic inquiry into the rape allegations leveled against Bill Cosby and the sexual assault allegations levied against Woody Allen by Farrow's sister, Dylan Farrow (who was 7 years old at the time of the alleged assault).[47] Farrow detailed first-hand accounts of journalists, biographers, and major publications purposefully omitting from their work decades of rape allegations targeting Cosby.[48] Similarly, Farrow recounts the efforts of Allen's publicist, Leslee Dart, to mount a media campaign focused on countering Dylan Farrow's allegations, while at the same time vindicating Allen:\nEvery day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted out by Allen's powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father's sexual relationship with another one of my siblings. Those emails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer\u2014therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points\u2014a self-perpetuating spin machine.[48]Farrow continues, by reiterating his support for Dylan Farrow and expressing his unwavering belief in her allegations:\nI believe my sister. This was always true as a brother who trusted her, and, even at 5 years old, was troubled by our father's strange behavior around her: climbing into her bed in the middle of the night, forcing her to suck his thumb\u2014behavior that had prompted him to enter into therapy focused on his inappropriate conduct with children prior to the allegations.[48]In closing his guest column, Farrow expresses his view of media culture as one that actively discourages victims of abuse from coming forward.[48] Farrow states that victims are pressured to remain silent by threat of \"having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures\"[48] as well as \"going up against angry fans and angry publicists\".[48] Farrow's regard for Hollywood (and media in general), as represented in his 2016 The Hollywood Reporter guest column, foreshadows his investigation into the alleged misconduct of Harvey Weinstein which would be published the following year.\nOn October 10, 2017, The New Yorker published an investigative article by Farrow detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against film producer Harvey Weinstein five days after The New York Times published the findings of its own investigation into Weinstein. It was subsequently revealed that Farrow originally worked on the story for NBC and that the network decided against airing his initial findings in 2016.[49][50][51] The New Yorker won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for Farrow's reporting, sharing the award with Jodi Kantor and Meghan Twohey at The New York Times.[52] Farrow was included in the Time \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" list in 2018.[53][54]\nOn May 7, 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Farrow and fellow reporter Jane Mayer stating that, during his term in office, the New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and that he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs. Schneiderman resigned within hours of the publication of the article on the following day.[55][56] Mayer and Farrow reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations with photographs of contusions and with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults.[55] Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated that he resigned because they \"effectively prevent me from leading the office's work\".[57] Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman.[58]\nOn July 27, 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Farrow stating that six women had accused media executive and CBS CEO Leslie Moonves of harassment and intimidation, and that dozens more described abuse at his company.[59] On August 23, The New Yorker published an article by Adam Entous and Farrow stating that top aides of the Trump White House circulated a conspiracy memo entitled \"The Echo Chamber\" about Obama aides.[60] On September 14, Farrow and Jane Mayer published information pertaining to an allegation of sexual assault by United States Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.[61] The woman making the allegation was revealed to be professor Christine Blasey Ford, who would go on to testify against Kavanaugh before his successful confirmation.\nIn early 2019, Farrow said he and another journalist received demands from American Media, Inc. that sought to extort or blackmail him.[62] He also investigated the concealment by the MIT Media Lab of its involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, leading to the resignation of the director of the Media Lab, Joi Ito, and an internal investigation by MIT.[63]\nFarrow voiced minor characters in the English-language versions of two Japanese animated films, From Up on Poppy Hill (2011)[64] and The Wind Rises (2013).[65] He also guest starred as himself on the Netflix comedy series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.[66] Farrow also made an appearance on the ABC talk show The View as a guest co-host on December 3, 2019.[67][68]\nIn 2008, Farrow was awarded Refugees International's McCall-Pierpaoli Humanitarian Award for \"extraordinary service to refugees and displaced people\".[69] In 2009, Farrow was named New York magazine's \"New Activist\" of the year and included on its list of individuals \"on the verge of changing their worlds\".[70] In 2011, Harper's Bazaar listed him as an \"up-and-coming politician\".[17][71] In 2012, he was ranked number one in \"Law and Policy\" on Forbes magazine's \"30 Under 30\" Most Influential People.[72] He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Dominican University of California in 2012.[73] In its 2013 retrospective of men born in its 80 years of publication, Esquire magazine named him the man of the year of his birth.[74]\nIn February 2014, Farrow received the third annual Cronkite Award for \"Excellence in Exploration and Journalism\" from Reach the World, in recognition of his work since 2001, including his being a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth in 2001.[75][76] Some media outlets noted that the award came three days after Ronan Farrow Daily began airing and suggested that the award was therefore not justified.[77][78] Farrow is the recipient of the Stonewall Community Foundation's 2016 Vision Award for his reporting on transgender issues.[79] He was also recognized by the Point Foundation in 2018, receiving the Point Courage Award for his in-depth reporting on #MeToo.[80][81] In July 2018, Farrow won the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association\u2019s Journalist of the Year award.[82] In 2019, he was listed among the 40 Under 40 List put out by Connecticut Magazine.[83] He was also named the Out100 Journalist of the Year.[84]\nAs of August 2019, Farrow resided in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.[85] He publicly identified as part of the LGBT community in 2018.[86]\nFarrow began dating podcast host and former presidential speech writer Jon Lovett in 2011.[87][88][89] The two became engaged in 2019 after Farrow wrote a proposal to Lovett in the Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators book's draft.[90][91] The couple bought a $1.87 million home in Los Angeles in August 2019.[85]\nFarrow is estranged from his father, Woody Allen.[92][93] After Allen married Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and Andr\u00e9 Previn, Farrow commented, \"He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression.\"[94]\nIn a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Mia Farrow stated that Ronan could \"possibly\" be the biological child of singer Frank Sinatra, with whom she said she \"never really split up.\"[95][1] In a 2015 CBS Sunday Morning interview, Sinatra's daughter Nancy dismissed the idea that her father is the biological father of Ronan Farrow, calling it \"nonsense\", and said her father had a vasectomy years before Ronan's birth.[96][97]\nFarrow has refused to discuss DNA, and stated that despite their estrangement, \"Woody Allen, legally, ethically, personally was absolutely a father in our family.\"[98] In a 2018 New York magazine article, Woody Allen said that Farrow may indeed be Sinatra's son: \"In my opinion, he's my child \u2026 I think he is, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. I paid for child support for him for his whole childhood, and I don't think that's very fair if he's not mine.\"[99][100]\nBooks\nEssays and reporting\n</body></html>"
