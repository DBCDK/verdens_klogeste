                "text": "no title\n\nDonald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality. Trump was born and raised in Queens, a borough of New York City, and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School. He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. He owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television show, from 2003 to 2015. Forbes estimates his net worth to be $3.1\u00a0billion.[a] Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated 16 other candidates in the primaries. His political positions have been described as populist (specifically right-wing populism), protectionist, and nationalist. Despite not being favored in most forecasts, he was elected in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although he lost the popular vote.[b] He became the oldest first-term U.S. president,[c] and the first without prior military or government service. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have also been characterized as racially charged or racist. During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax-cut package for individuals and businesses, rescinding the individual health insurance mandate. He appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an America First agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal, eventually increasing tensions with the country. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imposed import tariffs triggering a trade war with China, and attempted negotiations with North Korea toward its denuclearization. A special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged Russian foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia. Mueller also investigated Trump for obstruction of justice, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that count. A 2019 House impeachment inquiry found that Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election from Ukraine to help his re-election bid and then obstructed the inquiry itself. The inquiry reported that he withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into his political rivals. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is the third[d] U.S. president to be impeached. The impeachment trial began on January 16, 2020. Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital in the borough of Queens, New York City.[3][4] His father was Frederick Christ Trump, a Bronx-born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants. His mother was Scottish-born housewife Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.[5][6] At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school.[7] In 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University.[8][9] Two years later he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[9][10] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump & Son,[11] graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics.[9][12] Profiles of Trump published in The New York Times in 1973 and 1976 erroneously reported that he had graduated first in his class at Wharton but he had never made the school's honor roll.[13] In 2015 Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Fordham University and the New York Military Academy with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.[14][15] While in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments.[16][17] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968 a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve.[18] In October 1968, he was medically deferred and classified 1-Y (unqualified for duty except in the case of a national emergency).[19] Trump said in 2015 that the medical deferment was due to a bone spur in a foot, though he could not remember which foot had been afflicted.[19] In 1972, he was reclassified 4-F, due to bone spurs, which permanently disqualified him from service.[20][21] Trump's father, Fred, was born in 1905 in the Bronx. He started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15. Their company, \"E. Trump & Son\", founded in 1923,[22] was active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, building and selling thousands of houses, barracks, and apartments.[23] In spite of his German ancestry, Fred claimed to be Swedish amid the anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II;[24][25] Trump repeated this claim until the 1990s.[25][26] Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Scotland.[27] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[27][28] Trump grew up with three elder siblings\u00a0\u2013 Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth\u00a0\u2013 and younger brother Robert.[29] In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1.[30][31] They have three children, Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984), and ten grandchildren.[32] Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[33] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[34] Maples and Trump married in 1993[35][36] and had one daughter, Tiffany (born 1993).[37] They were divorced in 1999,[38] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[39] In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[40] They have one son, Barron (born 2006).[41] Melania gained U.S. citizenship in 2006.[42] Trump is a Presbyterian.[43] As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, where he had his confirmation.[44] In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan,[45] part of the Reformed Church.[46] The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale,[44] ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993.[47][45] Trump says he is \"not sure\" whether he ever asked God for forgiveness: \"If I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture.\" He tries to take Holy Communion as often as possible because it makes him \"feel cleansed\".[48] While campaigning, Trump referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book saying, \"Nothing beats the Bible.\"[49] In 2015, Trump's campaign released a list of religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, Michele Bachmann, and Robert Jeffress.[50][51] In November 2019, Trump appointed his personal pastor, controversial televangelist Paula White, to the White House Office of Public Liaison.[52] Trump has said that he abstains from alcohol, a reaction to his older brother Fred Trump Jr.'s alcoholism and early death,[53] and that he has never smoked cigarettes or cannabis.[54] He likes fast food.[55] He has said he prefers three to four hours of sleep per night.[56] He has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\",[57] although he usually does not walk the course.[58][59] He considers exercise a waste of energy, because he believes the body is \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\".[60][61] In December 2015, Harold Bornstein, who had been Trump's personal physician since 1980, wrote in a letter that he would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[62] In May 2018, Bornstein said Trump himself had dictated the contents of the letter,[63] and that three Trump agents had removed his medical records in February 2017 without due authorization.[64][65] In January 2018, White House physician Ronny Jackson said Trump was in excellent health and that his cardiac assessment revealed no issues,[66] although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended.[67] Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's 2018 LDL cholesterol level of 143 did not indicate excellent health.[68] In February 2019, after a new examination, White House physician Sean Conley said Trump was in \"very good health overall\", although he was clinically obese.[69] His 2019 coronary CT calcium scan score indicates he suffers from coronary artery disease, which is common for white men at his age.[70] In 1982, Trump was listed on the initial Forbes list of wealthy individuals as having a share of his family's estimated $200\u00a0million net worth. His financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from the list between 1990 and 1995.[71] In its 2019 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $3.1\u00a0billion[a] (715th in the world, 259th in the U.S.)[74] making him one of the richest politicians in American history and the first billionaire American president.[74] During the three years since Trump announced his presidential run in 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth declined 31% and his ranking fell 138 spots.[75] When he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10\u00a0billion;[76] however FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth over $50\u00a0million, yielding total assets worth more than $1.4\u00a0billion and debt over $265\u00a0million.[77] Trump stated in a 2007 deposition, \"My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings.\"[78] Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported in April 2018 that Trump, using a pseudonym \"John Barron\", called him in 1984 to falsely assert that he owned \"in excess of ninety percent\" of the Trump family's business, in an effort to secure a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.[79] Trump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest.[80] In October 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump \"was a millionaire by age 8\", borrowed at least $60\u00a0million from his father, largely failed to reimburse him, and had received $413\u00a0million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime.[81][82] According to the report, Trump and his family committed tax fraud, which a lawyer for Trump denied. The tax department of New York says it is \"vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation\" into it.[83][84] Analyses by The Economist and The Washington Post have concluded that Trump's investments underperformed the stock market.[85][86] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that the value of Trump's personal brand licensing business had declined by 88% since 2015, to $3\u00a0million.[87] Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17\u00a0billion over the ten-year period, in contrast to his claims about his financial health and business abilities. The New York Times reported that \"year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer\", and Trump's \"core business losses in 1990 and 1991\u00a0\u2013 more than $250\u00a0million each year\u00a0\u2013 were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years\". In 1995 his reported losses were $915.7\u00a0million.[88][89] Trump began his career in 1968 at his father Fred's real estate development company, E. Trump & Son, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[90][91] In 1971, he was named president of the family company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[92][93] Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. The financing was facilitated by a $400\u00a0million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump,[94] who also joined Hyatt in guaranteeing $70\u00a0million in bank construction financing.[95][96] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[97] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[98][99] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Organization and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[100][101][102] In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan with a loan of $425\u00a0million from a consortium of banks. Two years later, the hotel filed for bankruptcy protection, and a reorganization plan was approved in 1992.[103] In 1995, Trump lost the hotel to Citibank and investors from Singapore and Saudi Arabia, who assumed $300\u00a0million of the debt.[104][105] In 1996, Trump acquired a vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building.[106] In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28\u00a0ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors who were able to finance completion of the project, Riverside South. Trump temporarily retained a partial stake in an adjacent site along with other investors.[107] In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[108][109][110] Trump used a wing of the estate as a home, while converting the remainder into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues.[111] The initiation fee was $100,000 until 2016; it was doubled to $200,000 in January 2017.[112] On September 27, 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.[113][114] In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey with financing from the Holiday Corporation, who also managed the operation. Gambling had been legalized there in 1977 in an effort to revitalize the once-popular seaside destination.[115] Soon after it opened the casino was renamed \"Trump Plaza\", but the property's poor financial results worsened tensions between Holiday and Trump, who paid Holiday $70\u00a0million in May 1986 to take sole control of the property.[116][117][118] Earlier, Trump had also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320\u00a0million. Upon its completion in 1985, that hotel and casino was called Trump Castle. Trump's then-wife Ivana managed it until 1988.[119][120] Trump acquired a third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal, in 1988 in a highly leveraged transaction.[121] It was financed with $675\u00a0million in junk bonds and completed at a cost of $1.1\u00a0billion, opening in April 1990.[122][123][124] The project went bankrupt the following year,[125] and the reorganization left Trump with only half his initial ownership stake and required him to pledge personal guarantees of future performance.[126] Facing \"enormous debt\", he gave up control of his money-losing airline, Trump Shuttle, and sold his 282-foot (86\u00a0m) mega yacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[127][128][129] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[130] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent successive bankruptcies in 2004, 2009, and 2014, leaving Trump with only ten percent ownership.[131] He remained chairman of THCR until 2009.[132] As of December 2016[update], the Trump Organization owns or operates 18 golf course and golf resorts in the United States and abroad.[133] According to Trump's FEC personal financial disclosure, his 2015 golf and resort revenue amounted to $382\u00a0million,[134][135] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[136] Trump began acquiring and constructing golf courses in 1999; his first property was the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in Florida.[137] By 2007, he owned four courses around the U.S.[137] Following the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, he began purchasing existing golf courses and re-designing them.[138] His use of these courses during his presidency was controversial. Despite frequently criticizing his predecessor Barack Obama for his numerous golf outings, Trump golfed eleven times during his first eight weeks in office.[139] He visited one of his golf resorts on 187 of his first 848 days in office, 22 percent of the time.[140] After the Trump Organization's financial losses in the early 1990s, it refocused its business on branding and licensing the Trump name for building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies.[141] In the late 2000s and early 2010s, it expanded this branding and management business to hotel towers to locations around the world, including Chicago; Las Vegas; Washington, D.C.; Panama City; Toronto; and Vancouver. There were also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai, and Indonesia.[142] The Trump name has also been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings.[143][144] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than fifty licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, which have generated at least $59\u00a0million in yearly revenue for his companies.[145] By 2018 only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[144] As of April 2018[update], Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, according to a running tally by USA Today.[146] As of 2016[update], he or one of his companies had been the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump's side won 451 times and lost 38.[147][148] Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy.[149] His hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[150][151] Because the businesses used Chapter\u00a011 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, \"I do play with the bankruptcy laws\u00a0\u2013 they're very good for me\" as a tool for trimming debt.[152][153] The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[154][155] During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4\u00a0billion,[156] but in the aftermath of his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks declined to lend to him, with a notable exception of Deutsche Bank.[157] In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. In response, Trump sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chairman Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[158][159] In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[160] and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply.[161][162] Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings,[163] arguing that Congress was attempting to usurp the \"exercise of law-enforcement authority that the Constitution reserves to the executive branch\".[164][165] After taking over control of the Trump Organization in 1971, Trump expanded its real estate operations and ventured into other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[166][167] In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals\u00a0\u2013 an American football team that played in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule where they competed with the NFL for audience, and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the organization.[168][169] Trump's businesses have hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall adjacent to and promoted as taking place at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, including Mike Tyson's 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[170][171] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[172] Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies during the late 1980s, as Wall Street saw a wave of corporate acquisitions known as leveraged buyouts. In some cases, these acquisitions were hostile takeovers conducted by so-called corporate raiders. Some raiders purchased a stake in a public company with the stated but feigned intent of acquiring it, then pressured management to repurchase the stake at a profitable premium for the raider\u00a0\u2013 a practice known as greenmail. Some observers believed Trump was engaged in such practices, though he denied it. Analysis conducted by The New York Times found that Trump made millions of dollars in these stock transactions, but \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously.\"[173][174][175] In 1988, Trump founded Trump Shuttle, purchasing 21 planes and landing rights at three airports in New York City, Boston, and the Washington, D.C., area, from the defunct Eastern Air Lines, costing $380\u00a0million financed from 22 banks. The airline offered charter services in addition to scheduled shuttle flights, and was eventually sold to USAir Group in 1992 after failing to operate at a profit.[176] From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part of or all the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[177][178] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[179][180] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[181] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization, and sold the entire company to the William Morris talent agency.[182] In 2004, Trump co-founded a company called Trump University that sold real estate training courses priced at between $1,500 and $35,000.[183][184][185] After New York State authorities twice notified the company that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law, its name was changed to the \"Trump Entrepreneurial Institute\" in 2010.[186] In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40\u00a0million civil suit against Trump University; the suit alleged that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[186][187] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court; they named Trump personally as well as his companies. Internal documents of the company revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees said in depositions that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[188][189][190][191][192] Shortly after he won the presidency, Trump agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases and agreed to pay a total of $25\u00a0million.[193] New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called the settlement and payment \"a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university\".[194] Trump denied any wrongdoing.[195][196] The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a U.S.-based private foundation[197] established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal.[198][199] The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump, who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[200] The foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[201] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about forty groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[202][203] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5\u00a0million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[200] In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[204] Also in 2016, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that the foundation appeared to be in violation of New York laws regarding charities, ordering it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[205][206][207] A Trump spokesman called the Attorney General's investigation a \"partisan hit job\".[205] In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President\".[208] According to an IRS filing in November 2017, the foundation intended to shut down and distribute its assets (about $970,000) to other charities. However, the New York Attorney General's office had to complete their ongoing investigation before the foundation could legally shut down,[209] and in June 2018 they filed a civil suit against the foundation for $2.8\u00a0million in restitution and additional penalties.[210] The suit names Trump himself as well as his adult children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka.[211] In December 2018, the foundation agreed to cease operation and disburse all its assets. Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who oversaw the investigation and lawsuit, said the investigation uncovered a \"shocking pattern of illegality\".[212][213] Months later, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2\u00a0million to a group of charities for \"breaching his fiduciary duty to properly oversee the foundation that bears his name\". The Foundation characterized the penalty as a \"contribution\", stating it was \"pleased to donate an additional $2\u00a0million\" to \"worthy organizations\". Trump acknowledged that a January 2016 fundraiser for veterans he organized had actually been a campaign event and the $2.8\u00a0million in raised funds were placed under the full control of his campaign.[214][215] Before being inaugurated as president, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his eldest sons and a business associate.[216][217] According to ethics experts, as long as Trump continues to profit from his businesses, the measures taken by Trump do not help to avoid conflicts of interest.[218] Because Trump would have knowledge of how his administration's policies would affect his businesses, ethics experts recommend that Trump sell off his businesses.[217] While Trump said his organization would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization has since pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic.[218] Multiple lawsuits have been filed alleging that Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution, which forbids presidents from taking money from foreign governments, due to his business interests; they argue that these interests allow foreign governments to influence him.[218][219] Previous presidents in the modern era have either divested their holdings or put them in blind trusts,[216] and he is the first president to be sued over the emoluments clause.[219] According to The Guardian, \"NBC News recently calculated that representatives of at least 22 foreign governments\u00a0\u2013 including some facing charges of corruption or human rights abuses such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Turkey and the Philippines\u00a0\u2013 seem to have spent funds at Trump properties while he has been president.\"[220] On October 21, 2019, Trump mocked the Emoluments Clause as \"phony\".[221] In 2015, Trump said he \"makes a lot of money with\" the Saudis and that \"they pay me millions and hundreds of millions.\"[222] And at a political rally, Trump said about Saudi Arabia: \"They buy apartments from me. They spend $40\u00a0million, $50\u00a0million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\"[223] In December 2015, Trump said in a radio interview that he had a \"conflict of interest\" in dealing with Turkey and Turkish president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan because of his Trump Towers Istanbul, saying \"I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul and it's a tremendously successful job\u00a0... It's called Trump Towers\u00a0\u2013 two towers instead of one\u00a0... I've gotten to know Turkey very well\".[224][225] Trump's first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), topped the New York Times Best Seller list for 13 weeks, and remained on the list for 48 weeks.[226] According to The New Yorker, \"The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, promoting an image of himself as a successful dealmaker and tycoon.\"[226] Tony Schwartz, who is credited as co-author, later said he did all the writing, a claim backed by Howard Kaminsky, then-head of Random House, the book's publisher.[226] Two further memoirs were published in 1990 and 1997. Writings credited to Trump then shifted to financial tips and political opinion.[227] Trump has had a sporadic relationship with professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment since the late 1980s; in 1988 and 1989, WrestleMania IV and V, which took place at the Atlantic City Convention Hall, were billed as taking place at the nearby Trump Plaza.[228][229][230] He headlined the record-breaking WrestleMania 23 in 2007.[230] In 2013, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.[231] Vince McMahon, the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, and his wife Linda\u00a0\u2013 who later served under Trump as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration\u00a0\u2013 donated toward his endeavors, including a total of $5\u00a0million to the Trump Foundation after WWE performances in 2007 and 2009, and $6\u00a0million to his presidential campaign in 2016.[230] In 2003, Trump became the co-producer and host of The Apprentice, a reality show in which contestants competed for a one-year management job with the Trump Organization, and Trump weeded out applicants with the catchphrase \"You're fired\".[167][232][233] He later co-hosted The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities competed to win money for charities.[167][232][234] In February 2015, Trump said he was not ready to sign on for another season of the show because he considered running for president.[235] Despite this, NBC planned a fifteenth season,[236] but in June distanced itself from Trump, citing \"derogatory statements regarding immigrants\" in his campaign announcement.[237] Trump has made cameo appearances in twelve films and 14 television series[238][239] and performed a song as a Green Acres character with Megan Mullally at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2005.[240][241] Trump receives a pension as a member of the Screen Actors Guild.[242] His financial disclosure forms mentioned an annual pension of $110,000 in 2016 and $85,000 in 2017.[242][243][244] Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[245] He also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped! (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.[246][247][248] In 2011, he was given a weekly unpaid guest commentator spot on Fox & Friends that continued until he started his presidential candidacy in 2015.[249][250][251][252] Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987, switched to the Reform Party in 1999, the Democratic Party in 2001, and back to the Republican Party in 2009.[253] He made donations to both the Democratic and the Republican parties, party committees, and candidates until 2010 when he stopped donating to Democrats and increased his donations to Republicans considerably.[254] In 1987, Trump spent $94,801 (equivalent to $213,344 in 2019) to place full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, proclaiming \"America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves.\"[255] The advertisements also advocated for \"reducing the budget deficit, working for peace in Central America, and speeding up nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union\".[256] After rumors of a presidential run, Trump was invited by then U.S. senator John Kerry (Democrat from Massachusetts), House speaker Jim Wright of Texas, and Arkansas congressman Beryl Anthony Jr. to host a fundraising dinner for Democratic congressional candidates and to switch parties. Anthony told The New York Times that \"the message Trump has been preaching is a Democratic message.\" Asked whether the rumors were true, Trump denied being a candidate, but said, \"I believe that if I did run for President, I'd win.\"[256] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired man in America.[257][258] In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the nomination of the Reform Party for the 2000 presidential election.[259][260] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[261] Trump eventually dropped out of the race, but still went on to win the Reform Party primaries in California and Michigan.[260][262] After his run, he left the party due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[259] He also considered running for president in 2004.[263] In 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for president.[264] Trump publicly speculated about running for president in the 2012 election, and made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. The speech is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[265] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election.[266] In February 2012, Trump endorsed Mitt Romney for president.[267] Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[268] Trump's moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[266][269][270] Before the 2016 election, The New York Times speculated that Trump \"accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world\" after Obama lampooned him at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April 2011.[271] In 2011, according to Evan Jones, the headmaster of the New York Military Academy at the time, the then-superintendent Jeffrey Coverdale had demanded Trump's academic records, to hand them over to \"prominent, wealthy alumni of the school who were Mr. Trump's friends\" at their request. Coverdale said he had refused to hand over Trump's records to trustees of the school, and instead sealed Trump's records on campus. Jones stated: \"It was the only time in my education career that I ever heard of someone's record being removed,\" while Coverdale further said: \"It's the only time I ever moved an alumnus's records.\" The incident reportedly happened days after Trump demanded President Barack Obama's academic records.[272] In 2013, Trump spoke at CPAC again;[273] he railed against illegal immigration, bemoaned Obama's \"unprecedented media protection\", advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and suggested that the government \"take\" Iraq's oil and use the proceeds to pay a million dollars each to families of dead soldiers.[274][275] He spent over $1\u00a0million that year to research a possible 2016 candidacy.[276] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. Trump responded that while New York had problems and its taxes were too high, he was not interested in the governorship.[277] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[278] On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump discussed illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan: \"Make America Great Again\".[279][280] Trump said his wealth would make him immune to pressure from campaign donors.[281] He declared that he was funding his own campaign,[282] but according to The Atlantic, \"Trump's claims of self-funding have always been dubious at best and actively misleading at worst.\"[283] In the primaries, Trump was one of seventeen candidates for the 2016 Republican nomination. This was the largest presidential field in American history.[284] Trump's campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[285] On Super Tuesday, Trump received the most votes, and he remained the front-runner throughout the primaries. By March 2016, Trump was poised to win the Republican nomination.[286] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016\u00a0\u2013 which prompted the remaining candidates Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns\u00a0\u2013 RNC chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[287] After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the general election. Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016. Clinton had established a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[288][289][290] On July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[291] Four days later, the two were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention.[292] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend.[293][294] On September 26, 2016, Trump and Clinton faced off in their first presidential debate, which was held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.[295] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning of that debate was dominated by references to a recently leaked tape of Trump making sexually explicit comments, which Trump countered by referring to alleged sexual misconduct on the part of Bill Clinton. Prior to the debate, Trump had invited four women who had accused Bill Clinton of impropriety to a press conference. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular attention, with some saying it undermined democracy.[296][297] Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.\u2013China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries[298] to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. During the campaign Trump repeatedly called NATO \"obsolete\".[299][300] His political positions have been described as populist,[301][302][303] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[304] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[305] usually considered a Democratic Party policy.[306][307] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a \"fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views\", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[308][309] Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[310][311][312] Politico has described his positions as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\",[312] while NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[313] In his campaign, Trump said he disdained political correctness; he also said the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[314][315][316] In part due to his fame, and due to his willingness to say things other candidates would not, and because a candidate who is gaining ground automatically provides a compelling news story, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[317] Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[318][319][320] At least four major publications\u00a0\u2013 Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times\u00a0\u2013 have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements, with the Los Angeles Times saying that \"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has\".[321] NPR said Trump's campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[322] Trump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[323] Trump adopted his ghostwriter's phrase \"truthful hyperbole\" to describe his public speaking style.[323][324] According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[325] During his presidential campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white supremacists.[326][327][328] He retweeted open racists,[329][330] and repeatedly refused to condemn David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan or white supremacists, in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, saying he would first need to \"do research\" because he knew nothing about Duke or white supremacists.[331][332] Duke himself enthusiastically supported Trump throughout the 2016 primary and election, and has said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to \"take our country back\".[333][334] After repeated questioning by reporters, Trump said he disavowed David Duke and the KKK.[335] Trump said on MSNBC's Morning Joe: \"I disavowed him. I disavowed the KKK. Do you want me to do it again for the 12th time? I disavowed him in the past, I disavow him now.\"[335] The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy,[336] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[337][338][339] Members of the alt-right enthusiastically supported Trump's campaign.[340] In August 2016, he appointed Steve Bannon\u00a0\u2013 the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u00a0\u2013 as his campaign CEO; Bannon described Breitbart News as \"the platform for the alt-right\".[341] In an interview days after the election, Trump condemned supporters who celebrated his victory with Nazi salutes.[342][343] As a presidential candidate, Trump disclosed details of his companies, assets, and revenue sources to the extent required by the FEC. His 2015 report listed assets above $1.4\u00a0billion and outstanding debts of at least $265\u00a0million.[77][344] The 2016 form showed little change.[135] Trump has not released his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promise in 2014 to do so if he ran for office.[345] He said his tax returns were being audited, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[346] Trump has told the press his tax rate was none of their business, and that he tries to pay \"as little tax as possible\".[347] In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump declared a loss of $916\u00a0million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[348] On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to MSNBC. The document states that Trump had a gross adjusted income of $150\u00a0million and paid $38\u00a0million in federal taxes. The White House confirmed the authenticity of the documents.[349][350] On April 3, 2019, the House Ways and Means Committee made a formal request to the Internal Revenue Service for Trump's personal and business tax returns from 2013 to 2018, setting a deadline of April 10.[351] That day, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the deadline would not be met,[352] and the deadline was extended to April 23, which also was not honored,[353] and on May\u00a06 Mnuchin said the request would be denied.[354] On May 10, 2019, committee chairman Richard Neal subpoenaed the Treasury Department and the IRS for the returns and seven days later the subpoenas were defied.[355][356] A fall 2018 draft IRS legal memo asserted that Trump must provide his tax returns to Congress unless he invokes executive privilege, contradicting the administration's justification for defying the earlier subpoena.[357] Mnuchin asserted the memo actually addressed a different matter.[358] On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides.[359] Trump received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[360][e] Clinton was ahead nationwide with 65,853,514 votes (48.18%) to 62,984,828 votes (46.09%).[363] Trump's victory was considered a stunning political upset by most observers, as polls had consistently showed Hillary Clinton with a nationwide\u00a0\u2013 though diminishing\u00a0\u2013 lead, as well as a favorable advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated throughout his campaign,[364] and many observers blamed errors in polls, partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.[365] The polls were relatively accurate,[366] but media outlets and pundits alike showed overconfidence in a Clinton victory despite a large number of undecided voters and a favorable concentration of Trump's core constituencies in competitive states.[367] Trump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which had been considered a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20\u00a0states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress. Trump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history, even after adjusting for inflation,[368] and the oldest person to take office as president.[369] He is also the first president who did not serve in the military or hold elective or appointed government office prior to being elected.[370][371][372] Of the 43[f] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office, two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet, and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[372] Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice versa both inside and outside the venues.[374][375][376] Trump's election victory sparked protests across the United States, in opposition to his policies and his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that these were \"professional protesters, incited by the media\", and were \"unfair\", but he later tweeted, \"Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country.\"[377][378] In the weeks following Trump's inauguration, massive anti-Trump demonstrations took place, such as the Women Marches, which gathered 2,600,000 people worldwide,[379] including 500,000 in Washington alone.[380] Marches against his travel ban began across the country on January 29, 2017, just nine days after his inauguration.[381] Trump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[382] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[383] Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[384] By January 2018, Trump's reelection committee had $22\u00a0million in hand,[385] and it had raised a total amount exceeding $67\u00a0million by December 2018.[386] $23\u00a0million was spent in the fourth quarter of 2018, as Trump supported various Republican candidates for the 2018 midterm elections.[387] Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[388] Upon inauguration, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his sons Eric and Don Jr.[389] His daughter Ivanka resigned from the Trump Organization and moved to Washington, D.C., with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the President,[390] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[391] On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat on the Supreme Court previously held by Justice Antonin Scalia until his death on February 13, 2016.[392] The economic expansion that began in June 2009 continued through Trump's first three years in office. Throughout his presidency, he has repeatedly and falsely characterized the economy as the best in American history.[393] In December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lowered personal tax brackets, increased child tax credit, doubled the estate tax exemption to $11.2\u00a0million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.[394] Trump is a skeptic of multilateral trade deals, as he believes they indirectly incentivize unfair trade practices that then tend to go unpoliced. He favors bilateral trade deals, as they allow one party to pull out if the other party is believed to be behaving unfairly. Trump favors neutral or positive balances of trade over negative balances of trade, also known as a \"trade deficit\". Trump adopted his current skeptical views toward trade liberalization in the 1980s, and he sharply criticized NAFTA during the Republican primary campaign in 2015.[395][396][397] He withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[398] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[399] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50\u00a0billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[400][401] On several occasions, Trump has said incorrectly that these import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury.[402] Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[403][404] Since his election Trump has made large budget cuts to programs that research renewable energy and has rolled back Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[405] In June 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[406] At the 2019 G7 summit, Trump skipped attending the sessions on climate change but stated afterward in a press conference that he is an environmentalist.[407] Trump has rolled back federal regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water pollution, and the usage of toxic substances. He relaxed environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, while expanding permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction. Trump also weakened protections for animals.[408] Trump's energy policies aimed to boost the production and exports of coal, oil, and natural gas.[409] Trump's early policies have favored rollback and dismantling of government regulations. He has signed 15 Congressional Review Act disapproval resolutions to allow Congress to repeal executive regulations, the second President to sign any such resolutions after the first CRA resolution was passed in 2001, and the first President to sign more than one such resolution.[410] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended or reversed ninety federal regulations.[411][412] On January 30, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[413][414] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[415] During his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or \"Obamacare\").[416][417] Shortly after taking office, he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May of that year, the House of Representatives voted to repeal it.[418] His first action as President was Executive Order 13765, which increased flexibility \"to the maximum extent permitted by law\" for the Cabinet to issue waivers, deferrals, and exemptions for the law while attempting to give states more flexibility.[419][420] Over the course of several months' effort, however, the Senate was unable to pass any version of a repeal bill.[421] Executive Order 13813 was subsequently issued to reduce regulations imposed under Obamacare by increasing competition.[422] Trump has expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\", and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[423][424][425] The 2017 tax bill effectively repealed the ACA's individual health insurance mandate in 2019,[426][427][428] and a budget bill Trump signed in 2019 repealed the Cadillac plan tax, medical device tax, and tanning tax.[429][430] As president, Trump has falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by ACA, while his administration declined to challenge a lawsuit that would eliminate it.[431] As a 2016 candidate, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020 he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.[432] Trump favored modifying the 2016 Republican platform opposing abortion, to allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[433] He has said he is committed to appointing pro-life justices.[434] He says he personally supports \"traditional marriage\"[435] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[434] Despite the statement by Trump and the White House saying they would keep in place a 2014 executive order from the Obama administration which created federal workplace protections for LGBT people,[436] in March 2017, the Trump administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections for LGBT people.[437] Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[438][439] although his views have shifted over time.[440] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[441] He favors capital punishment,[442][443] as well as the use of waterboarding and \"a hell of a lot worse\" methods.[444][445] Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico\u2013United States border to keep out illegal immigrants and vowed Mexico would pay for it.[446] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[447] and criticized birthright citizenship for creating \"anchor babies\".[448] He said deportation would focus on criminals, visa overstays, and security threats.[449] As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the gang MS-13, though research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans.[450] Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[451][452][453] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[454][455][456] On January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[457] Confusion and protests caused chaos at airports.[458][459] Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order, which she deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional;[460] Trump immediately dismissed her.[461][462] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February\u00a05 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation nationwide.[463][464] On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, and removed priorities for Christian minorities.[465][457] Again federal judges in three states blocked its implementation.[466] On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\".[467] The temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[468] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4,[469] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling.[470] In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA would be repealed after six months.[471] Trump argued that \"top legal experts\" believed DACA was unconstitutional, and called on Congress to use the six-month delay to pass legislation solving the \"Dreamers\" issue permanently.[472] No legislation had been agreed to on DACA by March 2018, when the delay expired.[473] Several states immediately challenged the DACA rescission in court.[474] Two injunctions in January and February 2018 allowed renewals of applications and stopped the rolling back of DACA, and in April 2018 a federal judge ordered the acceptance of new applications.[475] In August 2018, United States District Judge Andrew Hanen of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that DACA is likely unconstitutional, but left the program in place as litigation proceeds.[476] In April 2018, Trump enacted a \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy that temporarily took adults irregularly entering the U.S. into custody for criminal prosecution and forcibly separated children from parents, eliminating the policy of previous administrations, which had made exceptions for families with children.[477][478] By mid-June, more than 2,300 children had been placed in shelters, including Department of Health and Human Services-designated \"tender age\" shelters for children under thirteen,[479] culminating in demands from Democrats, Republicans, Trump allies, and religious groups that the policy be rescinded.[480] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law.[481][482][483] On June 20, Trump signed an executive order to end family separations at the U.S. border.[484] On June 26 a federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Trump administration to stop detaining immigrant parents separately from their minor children, and to reunite family groups who had been separated at the border.[485] On December 22, 2018, the federal government was partially shut down after Trump declared that any funding extension must include $5.6\u00a0billion in federal funds for a U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall to partly fulfill his campaign promise.[486] The shutdown was caused by a lapse in funding for nine federal departments, affecting about one-fourth of federal government activities.[487] Trump said he would not accept any bill that does not include funding for the wall, and Democrats, who control the House, said they would not support any bill that does. Senate Republicans have said they will not advance any legislation that Trump would not sign.[488] In earlier negotiations with Democratic leaders, Trump commented that he would be \"proud to shut down the government for border security\".[489] Trump has been described as a non-interventionist[490][491] and as an American nationalist.[492] In 2019, Trump gave a speech at the UN General Assembly calling for world leaders to look after their own interests.[493] He has repeatedly said he supports an \"America First\" foreign policy.[494] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[492] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[495] He says America should look inward, stop \"nation building\", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[491] His foreign policy has been marked by repeated praise and support of authoritarian strongmen and criticism of democratically-led governments.[496] Trump has cited China's president Xi Jinping,[497] Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte,[498] Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,[499] Turkey's president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan,[500] King Salman of Saudi Arabia,[501] Italy's prime minister Giuseppe Conte,[502] Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro[503] and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as examples of good leaders.[504] Trump has also praised Poland under the EU-skeptic, anti-immigrant Law and Justice party (PiS) as a defender of Western civilization.[505][506] In April 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[507] According to investigative journalist Bob Woodward, Trump had ordered his defense secretary James Mattis to assassinate Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after the chemical attack, but Mattis declined; Trump denied doing so.[508] In April 2018, he announced missile strikes against Assad's regime, following a suspected chemical attack near Damascus.[509] In December 2018, Trump declared \"we have won against ISIS,\" and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria, contradicting Department of Defense assessments.[510][511][512] Mattis resigned the next day over disagreements in foreign policy, calling this decision an abandonment of Kurd allies who had played a key role in fighting ISIS.[513] One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.[514] On January 6, 2019, national security advisor John Bolton announced America would remain in Syria until ISIS is eradicated and Turkey guarantees it will not strike America's Kurdish allies.[515] Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and signed a $110\u00a0billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.[516][517][518] Trump also praised his relationship with Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.[516] U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 to 14,000, as of January\u00a02017[update],[519] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[520] U.S. officials said then that they aimed to \"force the Taliban to negotiate a political settlement\"; in January 2018, however, Trump spoke against talks with the Taliban.[521] In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the White House acknowledged that Turkey would be carrying out a planned military offensive into northern Syria; as such, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area to avoid interference with that operation. The statement also passed responsibility for the area's captured ISIS fighters to Turkey.[522] In the following days, Trump suggested that the Kurds intentionally released ISIS prisoners in order to gain sympathy, suggested that they were fighting only for their own financial interests, suggested that some of them were worse than ISIS, and termed them \"no angels\".[523] Congress members of both parties denounced the move, including Republican allies of Trump such as Senator Lindsey Graham. They argued that the move betrayed the American-allied Kurds, and would benefit ISIS, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime.[524] Trump defended the move, citing the high cost of supporting the Kurds, and the lack of support from the Kurds in past U.S. wars.[525][526] After the U.S. pullout, Turkey proceeded to attack Kurdish-controlled areas in northeastern Syria.[527] On October 16, the United States House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, \"condemned\" Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for, in the view of both parties, \"abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe\".[528][529] Trump has described the regime in Iran as \"the rogue regime,\" although he has also asserted he does not seek regime change.[530][531] He has repeatedly criticized the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or \"Iran nuclear deal\") that was negotiated with the United States, Iran, and five other world powers in 2015, calling it \"terrible\" and saying the Obama administration had negotiated the agreement \"from desperation\".[532][533][534] Following Iran's ballistic missile tests on January 29, 2017, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities in February 2017.[535][536][537] Trump reportedly lobbied \"dozens\" of European officials against doing business with Iran during the May 2017 Brussels summit; this likely violated the terms of the JCPOA, under which the U.S. may not pursue \"any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran\". The Trump administration certified in July 2017 that Iran had upheld its end of the agreement.[538] On August 2, 2017, Trump signed into law the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea.[539] On May 18, 2018, Trump announced the United States' unilateral departure from the JCPOA.[533] In May 2017, strained relations between the U.S. and Iran escalated when Trump deployed military bombers and a carrier group to the Persian Gulf. Trump hinted at war on social media, provoking a response from Iran for what Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif called \"genocidal taunts\".[540][541][542] Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman are allies in the conflict with Iran.[543] Trump approved the deployment of additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates following the attack on Saudi oil facilities which the United States has blamed on Iran.[544] He also ordered a targeted U.S. airstrike on January 2, 2020, which killed Iranian Major General and IRGC Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, as well as eight other people.[545] Trump publicly threatened to attack Iranian cultural sites if Iran retaliated; such an attack by the U.S. would violate international law.[546] On January 8, 2020, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched multiple ballistic missiles on two U.S. airbases in Iraq.[547] Trump has supported the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[548] On May 22, 2017, he was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip.[549][550] Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6, 2017, despite criticism and warnings from world leaders. He subsequently opened a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem in May 2018.[551][552] The United Nations General Assembly condemned the move, adopting a resolution that \"calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem.\"[553][554] In March 2019, Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy by recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights,[555] a move condemned by the European Union and the Arab League.[556] Before and during his presidency, Trump has repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.[557] During his presidency, Trump has launched a trade war against China, sanctioned Huawei for its alleged ties to Iran,[558] significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese nationality students and scholars[559][560] and classified China as a \"currency manipulator\".[561] In the wake of the significant deterioration of relations, many political observers have warned against a new cold war between China and the U.S.[562][563][564] In 2017, North Korea's nuclear weapons became increasingly seen as a serious threat to the United States.[565][566][567] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocations against the U.S. would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".[568] In response, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to direct a missile test toward Guam.[569] On June 12, 2018, Trump and Kim held a summit in Singapore,[570] resulting in North Korea affirming its promise to work toward complete denuclearization.[571][572] A second summit took place in February 2019, in Hanoi, Vietnam.[573] It ended abruptly without an agreement, both sides blaming each other and offering differing accounts of the negotiations.[573][574][575] On June 30, 2019, Trump, Kim, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held brief talks in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, marking the first time a sitting U.S. president had set foot on North Korean soil. They agreed to resume negotiations.[576] Talks in Stockholm began on October 5, 2019, between U.S. and North Korean negotiating teams, but broke down after one day.[577] During his campaign and as president, Trump repeatedly said he wants better relations with Russia,[578][579] and he has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[580][581] He also said Russia could help the U.S. in its fight against ISIS.[582] According to Putin and some political experts and diplomats, the U.S.\u2013Russian relations, which were already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have further deteriorated since Trump took office in January 2017.[583][584][585] After Trump met Putin at the Helsinki Summit on July 16, 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for siding with Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of the United States intelligence community.[586][587][588] Trump has made both pro- and anti-Russia statements regarding Crimea,[589] Syria,[590] Ukraine,[591] North Korea,[592] Venezuela,[593] election meddling,[594] and Skripal poisoning.[595] Trump also said U.S. oil companies cannot resume oil drilling in Russia.[596] In November 2017, the Trump administration tightened the rules on trade with Cuba and individual visits to the country, undoing the Obama administration's loosening of restrictions. According to an administration official, the new rules were intended to hinder trade with businesses with ties to the Cuban military, intelligence and security services.[597] On August 11, 2017, Trump said he is \"not going to rule out a military option\" to confront the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.[598] In September 2018, Trump called \"for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela\" and said that \"socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty.\"[599] On January 23, 2019, Maduro announced that Venezuela was breaking ties with the United States following Trump's announcement of recognizing Juan Guaid\u00f3, the Venezuelan opposition leader, as the interim president of Venezuela.[600] As a candidate, Trump questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[601] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[602] As president, he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO in March 2017.[603] However, he has repeatedly accused fellow NATO members of paying less than their fair share of the expenses of the alliance.[604] In January 2019, The New York Times quoted senior administration officials as saying Trump has privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from NATO.[605] The next day Trump said the United States is going to \"be with NATO one hundred percent\" but repeated that the other countries have to \"step up\" and pay more.[606] The Trump administration has been characterized by high turnover, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[607] As of early July\u00a02018[update], 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[608] and 141 staffers had left in the past year.[609] Both figures set a record for recent presidents\u00a0\u2013 more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[610] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Mike Flynn (after just 25 days in office), Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, replaced by retired Marine general John F. Kelly on July 28, 2017,[611] and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[610] Close personal aides to Trump such as Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee and Keith Schiller, have quit or been forced out.[612] Trump's cabinet nominations included U.S. senator from Alabama Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[613] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[614] retired Marine Corps general James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[615] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[616] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, such as neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[617] and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[618] Two of Trump's 15 original cabinet members were gone within 15 months: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft, and Trump replaced Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo in March 2018 over disagreements on foreign policy.[619][612] EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in July 2018 amidst multiple investigations into his conduct,[620] while Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned five months later as he also faced multiple investigations.[621] Trump has been slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying that many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[622] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61%) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37%).[623] On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. He first attributed this action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[624] which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails.[625] On May 11, Trump said he was concerned with the ongoing \"Russia thing\"[626] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier, regardless of DOJ advice.[627] According to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he \"hoped\" Comey would drop the investigation into National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.[628] In March and April, Trump had told Comey the ongoing suspicions formed a \"cloud\" impairing his presidency,[629] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[630] He also asked intelligence chiefs Dan Coats and Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[631] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[632] Comey eventually testified on June\u00a08 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[629][633] Presidential approval polls have shown him to be consistently unpopular.[634] His approval rating has been steady at around 40% with an unusually narrow margin between lowest and highest of \u00b15%.[635] Polls taken during the first ten months of Trump's term showed him to be the least popular U.S. president in the history of modern opinion polls,[636][637][638] and this has remained consistent, with the average of polls showing more than 50% disapproval since March 2017 with virtually no approval outside of Republican voters.[639] A Pew Research Center global poll conducted in July 2017, found \"a median of just 22 percent has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs\". This compares to a median of 64 percent rate of confidence for his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump received a higher rating in only two countries: Russia and Israel.[640] An August 2017 Politico/Morning Consult poll found on some measures \"that majorities of voters have low opinions of his character and competence\".[641] By December 2018, Trump's approval ratings, averaged over many polls, stood at roughly 42%, two points below Obama's at the same time in his presidency, and one point above Ronald Reagan's.[642] Trump's two-year average Gallup approval rating was the lowest of any president since World War II.[643] Trump came in second to Obama in Gallup's poll asking Americans to name the man they admired the most near the end of 2017[644][645] and 2018,[646][647][645] and tied with Obama for first place in 2019.[648][649][645] Trump is the first elected president to not place first in his first year in office.[648][649] As president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[650][651][652] The statements have been documented by fact-checkers; academics and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics.[653][654][324] This trait of his was similarly observed when he was a presidential candidate.[655][656] His falsehoods have also become a distinctive part of his political identity.[654] Trump uttered \"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\" in office, according to The New York Times,[650] and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office, according to the \"Fact Checker\" political analysis column of The Washington Post.[657] By the Post's tally, it took Trump 601 days to reach 5,000 false or misleading statements and another 226 days to reach the 10,000 mark.[658] For the seven weeks leading up to the midterm elections, it rose to an average of thirty per day[659] from 4.9 during his first hundred days in office.[660] The Post's reported tally is 16,241 as of January 19, 2020, with the 2019 total more than double the cumulative total of 2017 and 2018.[661] Trump has made numerous comments and actions that have been characterized both within the U.S. and abroad as racially charged or racist.[662] Trump has repeatedly denied he is racist, asserting \"I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world\".[663] Many of his supporters say the way he speaks reflects his rejection of political correctness, while others accept it because they share such beliefs.[664][665] Several studies and surveys have found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascendance and have been more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[665][666] In a June 2018 Quinnipiac University poll, 49 percent of respondents believed he was racist, while 47 percent believed he was not.[667] Additionally, 55 percent said he \"has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly\".[668] In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[91] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. He has maintained his position on the matter into 2019.[669] Trump launched his political career in 2011 as a leading proponent of \"birther\" conspiracy theories alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.[670][671] In April 2011, Trump claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later saying this made him \"very popular\".[672][673] In September 2016, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[674] According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist appeals to whites\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[675] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\".[676][677] His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding Trump University were also criticized as racist.[678] Trump's comments in reaction to the 2017 Charlottesville far-right rally were interpreted as implying a moral equivalence between white supremacist demonstrators and counter-protesters.[679] In a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation, he reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[680] His remarks were condemned as racist worldwide, as well as by many members of Congress.[681][682] In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic members of Congress\u00a0\u2013 all four minority women, three of them native-born Americans\u00a0\u2013 should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[683] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240\u2013187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[684] White nationalist publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[685] Twenty-two women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct as of June\u00a02019[update]. There were allegations of rape, violence, being kissed and groped without consent, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked women.[686] In 2016, he denied all accusations, calling them \"false smears\", and alleged there was a conspiracy against him.[687][688][689] In October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was recorded bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[690][691][692] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. In the tape, Trump said: \"I just start kissing them\u00a0... I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything\u00a0... grab 'em by the pussy.\"[693] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he \"moved on her very heavily\".[693] Trump's language on the tape has been described as vulgar, sexist, and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign,[694][695] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[696][697] resulting in a group of GOP senators and representatives withdrawing their support for his candidacy, some requesting that he step aside.[698][699] In addition to the two women who had previously alleged sexual misconduct against Trump, fifteen more came forward in 2016, during the aftermath of the tape's release with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping.[700][701][702] Trump publicly apologized for his inappropriate boasting on the tape but also defended it as \"locker room talk\",[703] and instead deflected his actions by asserting allegations of inappropriate behavior by Bill and Hillary Clinton.[704] Some research suggests Trump's rhetoric causes an increased incidence of hate crimes.[705][706][707] During the 2016 campaign, he sometimes urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[708][709] Since then, some individuals or their attorneys have cited Trump's rhetoric as a defense for their hate speech or violent actions.[710] In August 2019 it was reported that a man who allegedly assaulted a minor for perceived disrespect toward the national anthem had cited Trump's rhetoric in his own defense.[711] It was also reported in August 2019 that a nationwide review conducted by ABC News had identified at least 36 criminal cases where Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence. Of these, 29 were based around someone echoing presidential rhetoric, while the other seven were someone protesting it or not having direct linkage.[712] Throughout his career, Trump has sought media attention. His interactions with the press turned into what some sources called a \"love-hate\" relationship.[713][714][715] Trump began promoting himself in the press in the 1970s.[716] Fox News anchor Bret Baier and former House speaker Paul Ryan have characterized Trump as a \"troll\" who makes controversial statements to see people's \"heads explode\".[717][718] Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency, Trump has repeatedly accused the press of intentionally misinterpreting his words and of being biased, calling them \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[314][719] In the campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[317] New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in September 2018 that one of the reasons for Trump's appeal was his media dominance. To answer the question of why the U.S. public could not stop being enthralled by his actions, she wrote \"Even in the so-called golden age of TV, Mr. Trump hasn't just dominated water-cooler conversation; he's sucked the water right out, making all other entertainment from N.F.L. games to awards shows pale in comparison.\"[720] Chozick quoted Brent Montgomery, the creator of the reality TV show Pawn Stars, saying \"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night. You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.\"[720] After winning the election, Trump told journalist Lesley Stahl he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[721] Into his presidency, Trump has described negative media coverage as \"fake news\".[722] Trump has privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' White House press credentials.[723] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[724] In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump.[725] The Trump White House held about 100 formal press briefings during 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two during 2019.[724] Trump has been the subject of comedians, Flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode \"Bart to the Future\", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017 on Comedy Central, while another one called Our Cartoon President debuted on Showtime in February 2018.[726] Trump's wealth and lifestyle had been a fixture of hip-hop lyrics since the 1980s, as he was named in hundreds of songs, most often in a positive tone.[727][728] Mentions of Trump turned negative and pejorative after he ran for office in 2015.[727] Trump's presence on social media has attracted attention worldwide since he joined Twitter in March 2009. He communicated heavily on Twitter during the 2016 election campaign, and has continued to use this channel during his presidency. The attention on Trump's Twitter activity has significantly increased since he was sworn in as president. As of May 2019, he is in the top 15 for most Twitter followers at more than 60\u00a0million.[729] Trump has frequently used Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public, sidelining the press.[730] Many of the assertions he tweeted have been proven false.[731][732][733] In 1983, Trump received the Jewish National Fund Tree of Life Award, after he helped fund the building of two playgrounds, a park, and a reservoir in Israel.[734][735][735] In 1986, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of \"patriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity\",[736] and in 1995 was awarded the President's Medal from the Freedoms Foundation for his support of youth programs.[737] He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007,[738] and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013.[739] Liberty University awarded Trump an honorary Doctorate of Business in 2012[740] and an honorary Doctor of Laws in 2017, during his first college commencement speech as president.[741][742] In 2015, Robert Gordon University revoked the honorary Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) they had granted him in 2010, stating that \"Mr. Trump has made a number of statements that are wholly incompatible with the ethos and values of the university.\"[743] In December 2016, Time named Trump as its \"Person of the Year\",[744] but Trump took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the \"President of the Divided States of America\".[745] In the same month, he was named Financial Times Person of the Year[746] and was ranked by Forbes the second most powerful person in the world after Vladimir Putin.[747] As president, Trump received the Collar of The Order of Abdulaziz al Saud from Saudi Arabia in 2017.[748] The Crossfire Hurricane FBI investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign was launched in mid-2016 during the campaign season. Since he assumed the presidency, Trump has been the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[84] The New York Times reported in May 2019 that there were 29 open investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and eleven Congressional investigations.[749] American Media, Inc. (AMI) paid $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal in August 2016,[750] and Trump's attorney Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in October 2016.[751] Both women were paid for non-disclosure agreements regarding their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[752] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged the payments at the direction of Trump in order to influence the presidential election.[753] AMI admitted paying McDougal to prevent publication of stories that might damage Trump's electoral chances.[754] Trump denied the affairs, and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but reimbursed him in 2017.[755][756] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[757] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[758][759] The closure of the federal investigation into the matter was announced in July 2019,[760] but days later the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the hush payments[761] and in August subpoenaed eight years of tax returns for Trump and the Trump Organization.[762] In January 2017, American intelligence agencies\u00a0\u2013 the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence\u00a0\u2013 jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[763][764] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that \"the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[765] The connections between Trump associates and Russia have been widely reported by the press.[766][767] One of Trump's campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency.[768] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[769][770] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[771] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[772] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that had been imposed the same day; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[773] The Washington Post reported that Trump had told Sergei Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[774] Trump and his allies have promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election, which has also been promoted by Russia in an effort to frame Ukraine.[775] On May 17, 2017, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) investigating \"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\",[776][777] thus taking over the existing FBI investigation into the matter.[777] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice, and possible campaign ties to other national governments.[778] Trump repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and the Russian government.[779] Trump sought to fire Mueller on several occasions\u00a0\u2013 in June 2017, December 2017, and April 2018\u00a0\u2013 and close the investigation, but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[780] He tried repeatedly to get former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to withdraw his recusal regarding Russia matters, believing Sessions would then put an end to the special counsel investigation.[781] On March 22, 2019, the special counsel concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr.[782] On March 24, Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress summarizing what he said were the \"principal conclusions\" in the report. He said the report did not conclude the President had committed any crimes, although it did not exonerate him for obstruction of justice.[783] Barr wrote on March 24 that given his authority to decide whether Trump had committed a crime, he and Rosenstein felt there was insufficient evidence to establish obstruction by Trump.[783] Trump interpreted Mueller's report a \"complete exoneration\", a phrase he repeated multiple times in the ensuing weeks.[784] Mueller privately complained to Barr on March 27 that his summary did not accurately reflect what the report said and there was now \"public confusion\".[785] Some legal analysts said Barr's description of the report's contents was misleading.[786] A redacted version of the final Mueller Report was released to the public on April 18, 2019, with the first volume finding that Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's.[787] Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[788][789] The evidence was incomplete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony.[790] The report states that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was illegal and occurred \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\" and details how Trump and his campaign \"welcomed and encouraged\" Russian foreign interference under the belief that they would politically benefit.[776][791][792][793][794] The second volume of the Mueller Report dealt with possible obstruction of justice by Trump.[795] The report did not exonerate him of obstruction, saying investigators were not confident of his innocence after examining his intent and actions.[796] Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\", as they could not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, and would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[797] The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[798] On August 21, 2018, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted on eight felony counts of false tax filing and bank fraud.[799] Trump said he felt very badly for Manafort and praised him for resisting the pressure to make a deal with prosecutors, saying \"Such respect for a brave man!\" According to Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, Trump had sought advice about pardoning Manafort but was counseled against it.[800] On November 29, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as \"Individual-1\" in the court documents.[801] The five Trump associates who have pleaded guilty or have been convicted in Mueller's investigation or related cases include Paul Manafort, deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen.[802][803] On January 25, 2019, Trump adviser Roger Stone was arrested at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and indicted on seven criminal charges;[804] he was convicted in November of that year.[805] In March 2019, the House Judiciary Committee launched a broad investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice, corruption, and abuse of power.[806] Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler sent letters demanding documents to 81 individuals and organizations associated with Trump's presidency, business, and private life, saying it is \"very clear that the president obstructed justice\".[807][808] Three other committee chairmen wrote the White House and State Department requesting details of Trump's communications with Putin, including any efforts to conceal the content of those communications.[808] The White House refused to comply with that request, asserting that presidential communications with foreign leaders are protected and confidential.[809] Impeachment and trial is a process under the United States Constitution whereby the legislature can remove from office a president, cabinet member, judge, or other civil officer.[810] The House of Representatives investigates the case; if the House votes to bring charges, that is an impeachment. There is then a trial in the Senate; a two-thirds vote is required to remove the person from office.[811] During much of Trump's presidency, Democrats were divided on the question of impeachment.[812] Fewer than 20 representatives in the House supported impeachment by January 2019; after the Mueller Report was released in April and special counsel Robert Mueller testified in July, this number grew to around 140 representatives.[813] In August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump had pressured Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential primary candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, that the White House attempted to \"lock down\" the call records in a cover-up.[814] The whistleblower further stated that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Giuliani and the Trump administration which may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Vice President Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.[815] Trump later confirmed having withheld military aid from Ukraine and offered contradicting reasons for the decision.[816][817][818] After the whistleblower complaint became known in September 2019, House speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[819][820] The Trump administration subsequently released a memorandum of the July 25 phone call, confirming that after Zelensky mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate and to discuss these matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.[814][821] According to the testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials, the events were part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[822] As a result, House speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[819][820] The Trump administration subsequently released a memorandum of the July 25 phone call, confirming that after Zelensky mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked Zelensky to discuss the matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.[814][821] Among several State Department employees testifying to congressional committees in October 2019, William Taylor, the charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine, testified that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelensky was being subjected to pressure from a private initiative directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelensky into making a public commitment to investigate the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[823] He said it was made clear that until Zelensky made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelensky to the White House.[824][825] Zelensky denied that he felt pressured by Trump.[826] On December 3, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee published a report authored by Democrats on the committee, stating that \"the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.\" The report stated that Trump withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political rivals. Furthermore, the report described Trump was the only U.S. president thus far to have \"openly and indiscriminately\" defied impeachment proceedings by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony.[827][828][829]:8,208 The Republicans of the House Committees had released a draft of a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence \"does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor.\"[830][831] On December 13, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.[832] After debate, the House of Representatives impeached Trump with both articles on December 18.[833] The Senate impeachment trial began on January 16, 2020.[834] On January 22, 2020, the Republican Senate majority rejected amendments proposed by the Democratic minority to call witnesses and subpoena documents; evidence collected during the House impeachment proceedings will be entered into the Senate record automatically unless objected to on a case-by-case basis.[835] For the three days, January 22\u201324, the impeachment managers for the House presented their case to the Senate. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they included an impeachment process in the Constitution.[836] Responding over the next three days, the Trump legal team did not deny the facts as presented in the charges, but stated that Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[837] They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because Trump was not charged with a crime; that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense; and that Trump therefore should be acquitted immediately.[837] January 29 and 30 were devoted to written questions from senators.[838] On January 31 the Senate voted against calling any witnesses.[839] The vote on whether to convict the president is scheduled for February 5.[840] *\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.",

Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.\nTrump was born and raised in Queens, a borough of New York City, and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School. He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. He owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television show, from 2003 to 2015. Forbes estimates his net worth to be $3.1\u00a0billion.[a]\nTrump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated 16 other candidates in the primaries. His political positions have been described as populist (specifically right-wing populism), protectionist, and nationalist. Despite not being favored in most forecasts, he was elected in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although he lost the popular vote.[b] He became the oldest first-term U.S. president,[c] and the first without prior military or government service. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have also been characterized as racially charged or racist.\nDuring his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax-cut package for individuals and businesses, rescinding the individual health insurance mandate. He appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an America First agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal, eventually increasing tensions with the country. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imposed import tariffs triggering a trade war with China, and attempted negotiations with North Korea toward its denuclearization.\nA special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged Russian foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia. Mueller also investigated Trump for obstruction of justice, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that count. A 2019 House impeachment inquiry found that Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election from Ukraine to help his re-election bid and then obstructed the inquiry itself. The inquiry reported that he withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into his political rivals. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is the third[d] U.S. president to be impeached. The impeachment trial began on January 16, 2020.\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital in the borough of Queens, New York City.[3][4] His father was Frederick Christ Trump, a Bronx-born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants. His mother was Scottish-born housewife Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.[5][6] At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school.[7]\nIn 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University.[8][9] Two years later he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[9][10] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son,[11] graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics.[9][12] Profiles of Trump published in The New York Times in 1973 and 1976 erroneously reported that he had graduated first in his class at Wharton but he had never made the school's honor roll.[13] In 2015 Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Fordham University and the New York Military Academy with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.[14][15]\nWhile in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments.[16][17] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968 a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve.[18] In October 1968, he was medically deferred and classified 1-Y (unqualified for duty except in the case of a national emergency).[19] Trump said in 2015 that the medical deferment was due to a bone spur in a foot, though he could not remember which foot had been afflicted.[19] In 1972, he was reclassified 4-F, due to bone spurs, which permanently disqualified him from service.[20][21]\nTrump's father, Fred, was born in 1905 in the Bronx. He started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15. Their company, \"E. Trump &amp; Son\", founded in 1923,[22] was active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, building and selling thousands of houses, barracks, and apartments.[23] In spite of his German ancestry, Fred claimed to be Swedish amid the anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II;[24][25] Trump repeated this claim until the 1990s.[25][26] Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Scotland.[27] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[27][28] Trump grew up with three elder siblings\u00a0\u2013 Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth\u00a0\u2013 and younger brother Robert.[29]\nIn 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1.[30][31] They have three children, Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984), and ten grandchildren.[32] Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[33] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[34] Maples and Trump married in 1993[35][36] and had one daughter, Tiffany (born 1993).[37] They were divorced in 1999,[38] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[39] In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[40] They have one son, Barron (born 2006).[41] Melania gained U.S. citizenship in 2006.[42]\nTrump is a Presbyterian.[43] As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, where he had his confirmation.[44] In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan,[45] part of the Reformed Church.[46] The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale,[44] ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993.[47][45]\nTrump says he is \"not sure\" whether he ever asked God for forgiveness: \"If I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture.\" He tries to take Holy Communion as often as possible because it makes him \"feel cleansed\".[48] While campaigning, Trump referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book saying, \"Nothing beats the Bible.\"[49]\nIn 2015, Trump's campaign released a list of religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, Michele Bachmann, and Robert Jeffress.[50][51]\nIn November 2019, Trump appointed his personal pastor, controversial televangelist Paula White, to the White House Office of Public Liaison.[52]\nTrump has said that he abstains from alcohol, a reaction to his older brother Fred Trump Jr.'s alcoholism and early death,[53] and that he has never smoked cigarettes or cannabis.[54] He likes fast food.[55] He has said he prefers three to four hours of sleep per night.[56] He has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\",[57] although he usually does not walk the course.[58][59] He considers exercise a waste of energy, because he believes the body is \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\".[60][61]\nIn December 2015, Harold Bornstein, who had been Trump's personal physician since 1980, wrote in a letter that he would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[62] In May 2018, Bornstein said Trump himself had dictated the contents of the letter,[63] and that three Trump agents had removed his medical records in February 2017 without due authorization.[64][65]\nIn January 2018, White House physician Ronny Jackson said Trump was in excellent health and that his cardiac assessment revealed no issues,[66] although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended.[67] Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's 2018 LDL cholesterol level of 143 did not indicate excellent health.[68] In February 2019, after a new examination, White House physician Sean Conley said Trump was in \"very good health overall\", although he was clinically obese.[69] His 2019 coronary CT calcium scan score indicates he suffers from coronary artery disease, which is common for white men at his age.[70]\nIn 1982, Trump was listed on the initial Forbes list of wealthy individuals as having a share of his family's estimated $200\u00a0million net worth. His financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from the list between 1990 and 1995.[71] In its 2019 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $3.1\u00a0billion[a] (715th in the world, 259th in the U.S.)[74] making him one of the richest politicians in American history and the first billionaire American president.[74] During the three years since Trump announced his presidential run in 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth declined 31% and his ranking fell 138 spots.[75] When he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10\u00a0billion;[76] however FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth over $50\u00a0million, yielding total assets worth more than $1.4\u00a0billion and debt over $265\u00a0million.[77] Trump stated in a 2007 deposition, \"My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings.\"[78]\nJournalist Jonathan Greenberg reported in April 2018 that Trump, using a pseudonym \"John Barron\", called him in 1984 to falsely assert that he owned \"in excess of ninety percent\" of the Trump family's business, in an effort to secure a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.[79]\nTrump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest.[80] In October 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump \"was a millionaire by age 8\", borrowed at least $60\u00a0million from his father, largely failed to reimburse him, and had received $413\u00a0million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime.[81][82] According to the report, Trump and his family committed tax fraud, which a lawyer for Trump denied. The tax department of New York says it is \"vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation\" into it.[83][84] Analyses by The Economist and The Washington Post have concluded that Trump's investments underperformed the stock market.[85][86] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that the value of Trump's personal brand licensing business had declined by 88% since 2015, to $3\u00a0million.[87]\nTrump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17\u00a0billion over the ten-year period, in contrast to his claims about his financial health and business abilities. The New York Times reported that \"year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer\", and Trump's \"core business losses in 1990 and 1991\u00a0\u2013 more than $250\u00a0million each year\u00a0\u2013 were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years\". In 1995 his reported losses were $915.7\u00a0million.[88][89]\nTrump began his career in 1968 at his father Fred's real estate development company, E. Trump &amp; Son, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[90][91] In 1971, he was named president of the family company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[92][93]\nTrump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. The financing was facilitated by a $400\u00a0million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump,[94] who also joined Hyatt in guaranteeing $70\u00a0million in bank construction financing.[95][96] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[97] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[98][99] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Organization and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[100][101][102]\nIn 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan with a loan of $425\u00a0million from a consortium of banks. Two years later, the hotel filed for bankruptcy protection, and a reorganization plan was approved in 1992.[103] In 1995, Trump lost the hotel to Citibank and investors from Singapore and Saudi Arabia, who assumed $300\u00a0million of the debt.[104][105]\nIn 1996, Trump acquired a vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building.[106] In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28\u00a0ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors who were able to finance completion of the project, Riverside South. Trump temporarily retained a partial stake in an adjacent site along with other investors.[107]\nIn 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[108][109][110] Trump used a wing of the estate as a home, while converting the remainder into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues.[111] The initiation fee was $100,000 until 2016; it was doubled to $200,000 in January 2017.[112] On September 27, 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.[113][114]\nIn 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey with financing from the Holiday Corporation, who also managed the operation. Gambling had been legalized there in 1977 in an effort to revitalize the once-popular seaside destination.[115] Soon after it opened the casino was renamed \"Trump Plaza\", but the property's poor financial results worsened tensions between Holiday and Trump, who paid Holiday $70\u00a0million in May 1986 to take sole control of the property.[116][117][118] Earlier, Trump had also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320\u00a0million. Upon its completion in 1985, that hotel and casino was called Trump Castle. Trump's then-wife Ivana managed it until 1988.[119][120]\nTrump acquired a third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal, in 1988 in a highly leveraged transaction.[121] It was financed with $675\u00a0million in junk bonds and completed at a cost of $1.1\u00a0billion, opening in April 1990.[122][123][124] The project went bankrupt the following year,[125] and the reorganization left Trump with only half his initial ownership stake and required him to pledge personal guarantees of future performance.[126] Facing \"enormous debt\", he gave up control of his money-losing airline, Trump Shuttle, and sold his 282-foot (86\u00a0m) mega yacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[127][128][129]\nIn 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[130] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent successive bankruptcies in 2004, 2009, and 2014, leaving Trump with only ten percent ownership.[131] He remained chairman of THCR until 2009.[132]\nAs of December 2016[update], the Trump Organization owns or operates 18 golf course and golf resorts in the United States and abroad.[133] According to Trump's FEC personal financial disclosure, his 2015 golf and resort revenue amounted to $382\u00a0million,[134][135] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[136]\nTrump began acquiring and constructing golf courses in 1999; his first property was the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in Florida.[137] By 2007, he owned four courses around the U.S.[137] Following the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, he began purchasing existing golf courses and re-designing them.[138] His use of these courses during his presidency was controversial. Despite frequently criticizing his predecessor Barack Obama for his numerous golf outings, Trump golfed eleven times during his first eight weeks in office.[139] He visited one of his golf resorts on 187 of his first 848 days in office, 22 percent of the time.[140]\nAfter the Trump Organization's financial losses in the early 1990s, it refocused its business on branding and licensing the Trump name for building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies.[141] In the late 2000s and early 2010s, it expanded this branding and management business to hotel towers to locations around the world, including Chicago; Las Vegas; Washington, D.C.; Panama City; Toronto; and Vancouver. There were also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai, and Indonesia.[142]\nThe Trump name has also been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings.[143][144] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than fifty licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, which have generated at least $59\u00a0million in yearly revenue for his companies.[145] By 2018 only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[144]\nAs of April 2018[update], Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, according to a running tally by USA Today.[146] As of 2016[update], he or one of his companies had been the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump's side won 451 times and lost 38.[147][148]\nTrump has never filed for personal bankruptcy.[149] His hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[150][151] Because the businesses used Chapter\u00a011 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, \"I do play with the bankruptcy laws\u00a0\u2013 they're very good for me\" as a tool for trimming debt.[152][153] The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[154][155]\nDuring the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4\u00a0billion,[156] but in the aftermath of his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks declined to lend to him, with a notable exception of Deutsche Bank.[157]\nIn April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. In response, Trump sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chairman Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[158][159] In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[160] and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply.[161][162] Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings,[163] arguing that Congress was attempting to usurp the \"exercise of law-enforcement authority that the Constitution reserves to the executive branch\".[164][165]\nAfter taking over control of the Trump Organization in 1971, Trump expanded its real estate operations and ventured into other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[166][167]\nIn September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals\u00a0\u2013 an American football team that played in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule where they competed with the NFL for audience, and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the organization.[168][169]\nTrump's businesses have hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall adjacent to and promoted as taking place at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, including Mike Tyson's 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[170][171] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[172]\nTrump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies during the late 1980s, as Wall Street saw a wave of corporate acquisitions known as leveraged buyouts. In some cases, these acquisitions were hostile takeovers conducted by so-called corporate raiders. Some raiders purchased a stake in a public company with the stated but feigned intent of acquiring it, then pressured management to repurchase the stake at a profitable premium for the raider\u00a0\u2013 a practice known as greenmail. Some observers believed Trump was engaged in such practices, though he denied it. Analysis conducted by The New York Times found that Trump made millions of dollars in these stock transactions, but \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously.\"[173][174][175]\nIn 1988, Trump founded Trump Shuttle, purchasing 21 planes and landing rights at three airports in New York City, Boston, and the Washington, D.C., area, from the defunct Eastern Air Lines, costing $380\u00a0million financed from 22 banks. The airline offered charter services in addition to scheduled shuttle flights, and was eventually sold to USAir Group in 1992 after failing to operate at a profit.[176]\nFrom 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part of or all the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[177][178] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[179][180] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[181] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization, and sold the entire company to the William Morris talent agency.[182]\nIn 2004, Trump co-founded a company called Trump University that sold real estate training courses priced at between $1,500 and $35,000.[183][184][185] After New York State authorities twice notified the company that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law, its name was changed to the \"Trump Entrepreneurial Institute\" in 2010.[186]\nIn 2013, the State of New York filed a $40\u00a0million civil suit against Trump University; the suit alleged that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[186][187] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court; they named Trump personally as well as his companies. Internal documents of the company revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees said in depositions that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[188][189][190][191][192] Shortly after he won the presidency, Trump agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases and agreed to pay a total of $25\u00a0million.[193] New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called the settlement and payment \"a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university\".[194] Trump denied any wrongdoing.[195][196]\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a U.S.-based private foundation[197] established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal.[198][199] The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump, who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[200]\nThe foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[201] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about forty groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[202][203] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5\u00a0million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[200]\nIn 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[204] Also in 2016, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that the foundation appeared to be in violation of New York laws regarding charities, ordering it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[205][206][207] A Trump spokesman called the Attorney General's investigation a \"partisan hit job\".[205] In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President\".[208] According to an IRS filing in November 2017, the foundation intended to shut down and distribute its assets (about $970,000) to other charities. However, the New York Attorney General's office had to complete their ongoing investigation before the foundation could legally shut down,[209] and in June 2018 they filed a civil suit against the foundation for $2.8\u00a0million in restitution and additional penalties.[210] The suit names Trump himself as well as his adult children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka.[211]\nIn December 2018, the foundation agreed to cease operation and disburse all its assets. Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who oversaw the investigation and lawsuit, said the investigation uncovered a \"shocking pattern of illegality\".[212][213] Months later, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2\u00a0million to a group of charities for \"breaching his fiduciary duty to properly oversee the foundation that bears his name\". The Foundation characterized the penalty as a \"contribution\", stating it was \"pleased to donate an additional $2\u00a0million\" to \"worthy organizations\". Trump acknowledged that a January 2016 fundraiser for veterans he organized had actually been a campaign event and the $2.8\u00a0million in raised funds were placed under the full control of his campaign.[214][215]\nBefore being inaugurated as president, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his eldest sons and a business associate.[216][217] According to ethics experts, as long as Trump continues to profit from his businesses, the measures taken by Trump do not help to avoid conflicts of interest.[218] Because Trump would have knowledge of how his administration's policies would affect his businesses, ethics experts recommend that Trump sell off his businesses.[217] While Trump said his organization would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization has since pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic.[218]\nMultiple lawsuits have been filed alleging that Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution, which forbids presidents from taking money from foreign governments, due to his business interests; they argue that these interests allow foreign governments to influence him.[218][219] Previous presidents in the modern era have either divested their holdings or put them in blind trusts,[216] and he is the first president to be sued over the emoluments clause.[219] According to The Guardian, \"NBC News recently calculated that representatives of at least 22 foreign governments\u00a0\u2013 including some facing charges of corruption or human rights abuses such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Turkey and the Philippines\u00a0\u2013 seem to have spent funds at Trump properties while he has been president.\"[220] On October 21, 2019, Trump mocked the Emoluments Clause as \"phony\".[221]\nIn 2015, Trump said he \"makes a lot of money with\" the Saudis and that \"they pay me millions and hundreds of millions.\"[222] And at a political rally, Trump said about Saudi Arabia: \"They buy apartments from me. They spend $40\u00a0million, $50\u00a0million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\"[223]\nIn December 2015, Trump said in a radio interview that he had a \"conflict of interest\" in dealing with Turkey and Turkish president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan because of his Trump Towers Istanbul, saying \"I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul and it's a tremendously successful job\u00a0... It's called Trump Towers\u00a0\u2013 two towers instead of one\u00a0... I've gotten to know Turkey very well\".[224][225]\nTrump's first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), topped the New York Times Best Seller list for 13 weeks, and remained on the list for 48 weeks.[226] According to The New Yorker, \"The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, promoting an image of himself as a successful dealmaker and tycoon.\"[226] Tony Schwartz, who is credited as co-author, later said he did all the writing, a claim backed by Howard Kaminsky, then-head of Random House, the book's publisher.[226]\nTwo further memoirs were published in 1990 and 1997. Writings credited to Trump then shifted to financial tips and political opinion.[227]\nTrump has had a sporadic relationship with professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment since the late 1980s; in 1988 and 1989, WrestleMania IV and V, which took place at the Atlantic City Convention Hall, were billed as taking place at the nearby Trump Plaza.[228][229][230] He headlined the record-breaking WrestleMania 23 in 2007.[230] In 2013, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.[231]\nVince McMahon, the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, and his wife Linda\u00a0\u2013 who later served under Trump as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration\u00a0\u2013 donated toward his endeavors, including a total of $5\u00a0million to the Trump Foundation after WWE performances in 2007 and 2009, and $6\u00a0million to his presidential campaign in 2016.[230]\nIn 2003, Trump became the co-producer and host of The Apprentice, a reality show in which contestants competed for a one-year management job with the Trump Organization, and Trump weeded out applicants with the catchphrase \"You're fired\".[167][232][233] He later co-hosted The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities competed to win money for charities.[167][232][234] In February 2015, Trump said he was not ready to sign on for another season of the show because he considered running for president.[235] Despite this, NBC planned a fifteenth season,[236] but in June distanced itself from Trump, citing \"derogatory statements regarding immigrants\" in his campaign announcement.[237]\nTrump has made cameo appearances in twelve films and 14 television series[238][239] and performed a song as a Green Acres character with Megan Mullally at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2005.[240][241] Trump receives a pension as a member of the Screen Actors Guild.[242] His financial disclosure forms mentioned an annual pension of $110,000 in 2016 and $85,000 in 2017.[242][243][244]\nStarting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[245] He also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped! (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.[246][247][248] In 2011, he was given a weekly unpaid guest commentator spot on Fox &amp; Friends that continued until he started his presidential candidacy in 2015.[249][250][251][252]\nTrump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987, switched to the Reform Party in 1999, the Democratic Party in 2001, and back to the Republican Party in 2009.[253] He made donations to both the Democratic and the Republican parties, party committees, and candidates until 2010 when he stopped donating to Democrats and increased his donations to Republicans considerably.[254]\nIn 1987, Trump spent $94,801 (equivalent to $213,344 in 2019) to place full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, proclaiming \"America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves.\"[255] The advertisements also advocated for \"reducing the budget deficit, working for peace in Central America, and speeding up nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union\".[256] After rumors of a presidential run, Trump was invited by then U.S. senator John Kerry (Democrat from Massachusetts), House speaker Jim Wright of Texas, and Arkansas congressman Beryl Anthony Jr. to host a fundraising dinner for Democratic congressional candidates and to switch parties. Anthony told The New York Times that \"the message Trump has been preaching is a Democratic message.\" Asked whether the rumors were true, Trump denied being a candidate, but said, \"I believe that if I did run for President, I'd win.\"[256] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired man in America.[257][258]\nIn 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the nomination of the Reform Party for the 2000 presidential election.[259][260] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[261] Trump eventually dropped out of the race, but still went on to win the Reform Party primaries in California and Michigan.[260][262] After his run, he left the party due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[259] He also considered running for president in 2004.[263] In 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for president.[264]\nTrump publicly speculated about running for president in the 2012 election, and made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. The speech is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[265]\nOn May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election.[266] In February 2012, Trump endorsed Mitt Romney for president.[267]\nTrump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[268] Trump's moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[266][269][270] Before the 2016 election, The New York Times speculated that Trump \"accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world\" after Obama lampooned him at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April 2011.[271]\nIn 2011, according to Evan Jones, the headmaster of the New York Military Academy at the time, the then-superintendent Jeffrey Coverdale had demanded Trump's academic records, to hand them over to \"prominent, wealthy alumni of the school who were Mr. Trump's friends\" at their request. Coverdale said he had refused to hand over Trump's records to trustees of the school, and instead sealed Trump's records on campus. Jones stated: \"It was the only time in my education career that I ever heard of someone's record being removed,\" while Coverdale further said: \"It's the only time I ever moved an alumnus's records.\" The incident reportedly happened days after Trump demanded President Barack Obama's academic records.[272]\nIn 2013, Trump spoke at CPAC again;[273] he railed against illegal immigration, bemoaned Obama's \"unprecedented media protection\", advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and suggested that the government \"take\" Iraq's oil and use the proceeds to pay a million dollars each to families of dead soldiers.[274][275] He spent over $1\u00a0million that year to research a possible 2016 candidacy.[276]\nIn October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. Trump responded that while New York had problems and its taxes were too high, he was not interested in the governorship.[277] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[278]\nOn June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump discussed illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan: \"Make America Great Again\".[279][280] Trump said his wealth would make him immune to pressure from campaign donors.[281] He declared that he was funding his own campaign,[282] but according to The Atlantic, \"Trump's claims of self-funding have always been dubious at best and actively misleading at worst.\"[283]\nIn the primaries, Trump was one of seventeen candidates for the 2016 Republican nomination. This was the largest presidential field in American history.[284] Trump's campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[285]\nOn Super Tuesday, Trump received the most votes, and he remained the front-runner throughout the primaries. By March 2016, Trump was poised to win the Republican nomination.[286] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016\u00a0\u2013 which prompted the remaining candidates Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns\u00a0\u2013 RNC chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[287]\nAfter becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the general election. Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016.\nClinton had established a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[288][289][290]\nOn July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[291] Four days later, the two were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention.[292] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend.[293][294]\nOn September 26, 2016, Trump and Clinton faced off in their first presidential debate, which was held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.[295] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning of that debate was dominated by references to a recently leaked tape of Trump making sexually explicit comments, which Trump countered by referring to alleged sexual misconduct on the part of Bill Clinton. Prior to the debate, Trump had invited four women who had accused Bill Clinton of impropriety to a press conference. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular attention, with some saying it undermined democracy.[296][297]\nTrump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.\u2013China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries[298] to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. During the campaign Trump repeatedly called NATO \"obsolete\".[299][300]\nHis political positions have been described as populist,[301][302][303] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[304] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[305] usually considered a Democratic Party policy.[306][307] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a \"fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views\", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[308][309]\nTrump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[310][311][312] Politico has described his positions as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\",[312] while NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[313]\nIn his campaign, Trump said he disdained political correctness; he also said the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[314][315][316] In part due to his fame, and due to his willingness to say things other candidates would not, and because a candidate who is gaining ground automatically provides a compelling news story, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[317]\nFact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[318][319][320] At least four major publications\u00a0\u2013 Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times\u00a0\u2013 have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements, with the Los Angeles Times saying that \"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has\".[321] NPR said Trump's campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[322]\nTrump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[323] Trump adopted his ghostwriter's phrase \"truthful hyperbole\" to describe his public speaking style.[323][324]\n\nAccording to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[325] During his presidential campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white supremacists.[326][327][328] He retweeted open racists,[329][330] and repeatedly refused to condemn David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan or white supremacists, in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, saying he would first need to \"do research\" because he knew nothing about Duke or white supremacists.[331][332] Duke himself enthusiastically supported Trump throughout the 2016 primary and election, and has said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to \"take our country back\".[333][334]\nAfter repeated questioning by reporters, Trump said he disavowed David Duke and the KKK.[335] Trump said on MSNBC's Morning Joe: \"I disavowed him. I disavowed the KKK. Do you want me to do it again for the 12th time? I disavowed him in the past, I disavow him now.\"[335]\nThe alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy,[336] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[337][338][339]\nMembers of the alt-right enthusiastically supported Trump's campaign.[340]\nIn August 2016, he appointed Steve Bannon\u00a0\u2013 the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u00a0\u2013 as his campaign CEO; Bannon described Breitbart News as \"the platform for the alt-right\".[341] In an interview days after the election, Trump condemned supporters who celebrated his victory with Nazi salutes.[342][343]\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump disclosed details of his companies, assets, and revenue sources to the extent required by the FEC. His 2015 report listed assets above $1.4\u00a0billion and outstanding debts of at least $265\u00a0million.[77][344] The 2016 form showed little change.[135]\nTrump has not released his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promise in 2014 to do so if he ran for office.[345] He said his tax returns were being audited, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[346] Trump has told the press his tax rate was none of their business, and that he tries to pay \"as little tax as possible\".[347]\nIn October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump declared a loss of $916\u00a0million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[348]\nOn March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to MSNBC. The document states that Trump had a gross adjusted income of $150\u00a0million and paid $38\u00a0million in federal taxes. The White House confirmed the authenticity of the documents.[349][350]\nOn April 3, 2019, the House Ways and Means Committee made a formal request to the Internal Revenue Service for Trump's personal and business tax returns from 2013 to 2018, setting a deadline of April 10.[351] That day, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the deadline would not be met,[352] and the deadline was extended to April 23, which also was not honored,[353] and on May\u00a06 Mnuchin said the request would be denied.[354] On May 10, 2019, committee chairman Richard Neal subpoenaed the Treasury Department and the IRS for the returns and seven days later the subpoenas were defied.[355][356] A fall 2018 draft IRS legal memo asserted that Trump must provide his tax returns to Congress unless he invokes executive privilege, contradicting the administration's justification for defying the earlier subpoena.[357] Mnuchin asserted the memo actually addressed a different matter.[358]\nOn November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides.[359] Trump received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[360][e] Clinton was ahead nationwide with 65,853,514 votes (48.18%) to 62,984,828 votes (46.09%).[363]\nTrump's victory was considered a stunning political upset by most observers, as polls had consistently showed Hillary Clinton with a nationwide\u00a0\u2013 though diminishing\u00a0\u2013 lead, as well as a favorable advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated throughout his campaign,[364] and many observers blamed errors in polls, partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.[365]\nThe polls were relatively accurate,[366] but media outlets and pundits alike showed overconfidence in a Clinton victory despite a large number of undecided voters and a favorable concentration of Trump's core constituencies in competitive states.[367]\nTrump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which had been considered a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20\u00a0states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress.\nTrump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history, even after adjusting for inflation,[368] and the oldest person to take office as president.[369] He is also the first president who did not serve in the military or hold elective or appointed government office prior to being elected.[370][371][372] Of the 43[f] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office, two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet, and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[372]\nSome rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice versa both inside and outside the venues.[374][375][376] Trump's election victory sparked protests across the United States, in opposition to his policies and his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that these were \"professional protesters, incited by the media\", and were \"unfair\", but he later tweeted, \"Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country.\"[377][378]\nIn the weeks following Trump's inauguration, massive anti-Trump demonstrations took place, such as the Women Marches, which gathered 2,600,000 people worldwide,[379] including 500,000 in Washington alone.[380] Marches against his travel ban began across the country on January 29, 2017, just nine days after his inauguration.[381]\nTrump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[382] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[383] Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[384] By January 2018, Trump's reelection committee had $22\u00a0million in hand,[385] and it had raised a total amount exceeding $67\u00a0million by December 2018.[386] $23\u00a0million was spent in the fourth quarter of 2018, as Trump supported various Republican candidates for the 2018 midterm elections.[387]\nTrump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[388]\nUpon inauguration, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his sons Eric and Don Jr.[389] His daughter Ivanka resigned from the Trump Organization and moved to Washington, D.C., with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the President,[390] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[391]\nOn January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat on the Supreme Court previously held by Justice Antonin Scalia until his death on February 13, 2016.[392]\nThe economic expansion that began in June 2009 continued through Trump's first three years in office. Throughout his presidency, he has repeatedly and falsely characterized the economy as the best in American history.[393]\nIn December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lowered personal tax brackets, increased child tax credit, doubled the estate tax exemption to $11.2\u00a0million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.[394]\nTrump is a skeptic of multilateral trade deals, as he believes they indirectly incentivize unfair trade practices that then tend to go unpoliced. He favors bilateral trade deals, as they allow one party to pull out if the other party is believed to be behaving unfairly. Trump favors neutral or positive balances of trade over negative balances of trade, also known as a \"trade deficit\". Trump adopted his current skeptical views toward trade liberalization in the 1980s, and he sharply criticized NAFTA during the Republican primary campaign in 2015.[395][396][397] He withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[398] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[399] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50\u00a0billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[400][401] On several occasions, Trump has said incorrectly that these import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury.[402]\nTrump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[403][404] Since his election Trump has made large budget cuts to programs that research renewable energy and has rolled back Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[405] In June 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[406] At the 2019 G7 summit, Trump skipped attending the sessions on climate change but stated afterward in a press conference that he is an environmentalist.[407]\nTrump has rolled back federal regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water pollution, and the usage of toxic substances. He relaxed environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, while expanding permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction. Trump also weakened protections for animals.[408] Trump's energy policies aimed to boost the production and exports of coal, oil, and natural gas.[409]\nTrump's early policies have favored rollback and dismantling of government regulations. He has signed 15 Congressional Review Act disapproval resolutions to allow Congress to repeal executive regulations, the second President to sign any such resolutions after the first CRA resolution was passed in 2001, and the first President to sign more than one such resolution.[410] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended or reversed ninety federal regulations.[411][412]\nOn January 30, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[413][414] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[415]\nDuring his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or \"Obamacare\").[416][417] Shortly after taking office, he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May of that year, the House of Representatives voted to repeal it.[418] His first action as President was Executive Order 13765, which increased flexibility \"to the maximum extent permitted by law\" for the Cabinet to issue waivers, deferrals, and exemptions for the law while attempting to give states more flexibility.[419][420] Over the course of several months' effort, however, the Senate was unable to pass any version of a repeal bill.[421] Executive Order 13813 was subsequently issued to reduce regulations imposed under Obamacare by increasing competition.[422] Trump has expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\", and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[423][424][425] The 2017 tax bill effectively repealed the ACA's individual health insurance mandate in 2019,[426][427][428] and a budget bill Trump signed in 2019 repealed the Cadillac plan tax, medical device tax, and tanning tax.[429][430] As president, Trump has falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by ACA, while his administration declined to challenge a lawsuit that would eliminate it.[431] As a 2016 candidate, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020 he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.[432]\nTrump favored modifying the 2016 Republican platform opposing abortion, to allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[433] He has said he is committed to appointing pro-life justices.[434] He says he personally supports \"traditional marriage\"[435] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[434] Despite the statement by Trump and the White House saying they would keep in place a 2014 executive order from the Obama administration which created federal workplace protections for LGBT people,[436] in March 2017, the Trump administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections for LGBT people.[437]\nTrump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[438][439] although his views have shifted over time.[440] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[441] He favors capital punishment,[442][443] as well as the use of waterboarding and \"a hell of a lot worse\" methods.[444][445]\nTrump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico\u2013United States border to keep out illegal immigrants and vowed Mexico would pay for it.[446] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[447] and criticized birthright citizenship for creating \"anchor babies\".[448] He said deportation would focus on criminals, visa overstays, and security threats.[449] As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the gang MS-13, though research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans.[450]\nFollowing the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[451][452][453] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[454][455][456]\nOn January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[457] Confusion and protests caused chaos at airports.[458][459] Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order, which she deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional;[460] Trump immediately dismissed her.[461][462] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February\u00a05 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation nationwide.[463][464] On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, and removed priorities for Christian minorities.[465][457] Again federal judges in three states blocked its implementation.[466] On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\".[467]\nThe temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[468] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4,[469] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling.[470]\nIn September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA would be repealed after six months.[471] Trump argued that \"top legal experts\" believed DACA was unconstitutional, and called on Congress to use the six-month delay to pass legislation solving the \"Dreamers\" issue permanently.[472] No legislation had been agreed to on DACA by March 2018, when the delay expired.[473] Several states immediately challenged the DACA rescission in court.[474] Two injunctions in January and February 2018 allowed renewals of applications and stopped the rolling back of DACA, and in April 2018 a federal judge ordered the acceptance of new applications.[475] In August 2018, United States District Judge Andrew Hanen of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that DACA is likely unconstitutional, but left the program in place as litigation proceeds.[476]\nIn April 2018, Trump enacted a \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy that temporarily took adults irregularly entering the U.S. into custody for criminal prosecution and forcibly separated children from parents, eliminating the policy of previous administrations, which had made exceptions for families with children.[477][478] By mid-June, more than 2,300 children had been placed in shelters, including Department of Health and Human Services-designated \"tender age\" shelters for children under thirteen,[479] culminating in demands from Democrats, Republicans, Trump allies, and religious groups that the policy be rescinded.[480] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law.[481][482][483]\nOn June 20, Trump signed an executive order to end family separations at the U.S. border.[484] On June 26 a federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Trump administration to stop detaining immigrant parents separately from their minor children, and to reunite family groups who had been separated at the border.[485]\nOn December 22, 2018, the federal government was partially shut down after Trump declared that any funding extension must include $5.6\u00a0billion in federal funds for a U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall to partly fulfill his campaign promise.[486] The shutdown was caused by a lapse in funding for nine federal departments, affecting about one-fourth of federal government activities.[487] Trump said he would not accept any bill that does not include funding for the wall, and Democrats, who control the House, said they would not support any bill that does. Senate Republicans have said they will not advance any legislation that Trump would not sign.[488] In earlier negotiations with Democratic leaders, Trump commented that he would be \"proud to shut down the government for border security\".[489]\nTrump has been described as a non-interventionist[490][491] and as an American nationalist.[492] In 2019, Trump gave a speech at the UN General Assembly calling for world leaders to look after their own interests.[493] He has repeatedly said he supports an \"America First\" foreign policy.[494] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[492] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[495] He says America should look inward, stop \"nation building\", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[491]\nHis foreign policy has been marked by repeated praise and support of authoritarian strongmen and criticism of democratically-led governments.[496] Trump has cited China's president Xi Jinping,[497] Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte,[498] Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,[499] Turkey's president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan,[500] King Salman of Saudi Arabia,[501] Italy's prime minister Giuseppe Conte,[502] Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro[503] and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as examples of good leaders.[504] Trump has also praised Poland under the EU-skeptic, anti-immigrant Law and Justice party (PiS) as a defender of Western civilization.[505][506]\nIn April 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[507] According to investigative journalist Bob Woodward, Trump had ordered his defense secretary James Mattis to assassinate Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after the chemical attack, but Mattis declined; Trump denied doing so.[508] In April 2018, he announced missile strikes against Assad's regime, following a suspected chemical attack near Damascus.[509]\nIn December 2018, Trump declared \"we have won against ISIS,\" and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria, contradicting Department of Defense assessments.[510][511][512] Mattis resigned the next day over disagreements in foreign policy, calling this decision an abandonment of Kurd allies who had played a key role in fighting ISIS.[513] One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.[514] On January 6, 2019, national security advisor John Bolton announced America would remain in Syria until ISIS is eradicated and Turkey guarantees it will not strike America's Kurdish allies.[515]\nTrump actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and signed a $110\u00a0billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.[516][517][518] Trump also praised his relationship with Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.[516]\nU.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 to 14,000, as of January\u00a02017[update],[519] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[520] U.S. officials said then that they aimed to \"force the Taliban to negotiate a political settlement\"; in January 2018, however, Trump spoke against talks with the Taliban.[521]\nIn October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the White House acknowledged that Turkey would be carrying out a planned military offensive into northern Syria; as such, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area to avoid interference with that operation. The statement also passed responsibility for the area's captured ISIS fighters to Turkey.[522] In the following days, Trump suggested that the Kurds intentionally released ISIS prisoners in order to gain sympathy, suggested that they were fighting only for their own financial interests, suggested that some of them were worse than ISIS, and termed them \"no angels\".[523]\nCongress members of both parties denounced the move, including Republican allies of Trump such as Senator Lindsey Graham. They argued that the move betrayed the American-allied Kurds, and would benefit ISIS, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime.[524] Trump defended the move, citing the high cost of supporting the Kurds, and the lack of support from the Kurds in past U.S. wars.[525][526] After the U.S. pullout, Turkey proceeded to attack Kurdish-controlled areas in northeastern Syria.[527] On October 16, the United States House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, \"condemned\" Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for, in the view of both parties, \"abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe\".[528][529]\nTrump has described the regime in Iran as \"the rogue regime,\" although he has also asserted he does not seek regime change.[530][531] He has repeatedly criticized the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or \"Iran nuclear deal\") that was negotiated with the United States, Iran, and five other world powers in 2015, calling it \"terrible\" and saying the Obama administration had negotiated the agreement \"from desperation\".[532][533][534]\nFollowing Iran's ballistic missile tests on January 29, 2017, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities in February 2017.[535][536][537] Trump reportedly lobbied \"dozens\" of European officials against doing business with Iran during the May 2017 Brussels summit; this likely violated the terms of the JCPOA, under which the U.S. may not pursue \"any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran\". The Trump administration certified in July 2017 that Iran had upheld its end of the agreement.[538] On August 2, 2017, Trump signed into law the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea.[539] On May 18, 2018, Trump announced the United States' unilateral departure from the JCPOA.[533]\nIn May 2017, strained relations between the U.S. and Iran escalated when Trump deployed military bombers and a carrier group to the Persian Gulf. Trump hinted at war on social media, provoking a response from Iran for what Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif called \"genocidal taunts\".[540][541][542] Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman are allies in the conflict with Iran.[543] Trump approved the deployment of additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates following the attack on Saudi oil facilities which the United States has blamed on Iran.[544] He also ordered a targeted U.S. airstrike on January 2, 2020, which killed Iranian Major General and IRGC Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, as well as eight other people.[545] Trump publicly threatened to attack Iranian cultural sites if Iran retaliated; such an attack by the U.S. would violate international law.[546] On January 8, 2020, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched multiple ballistic missiles on two U.S. airbases in Iraq.[547]\nTrump has supported the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[548] On May 22, 2017, he was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip.[549][550] Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6, 2017, despite criticism and warnings from world leaders. He subsequently opened a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem in May 2018.[551][552] The United Nations General Assembly condemned the move, adopting a resolution that \"calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem.\"[553][554] In March 2019, Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy by recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights,[555] a move condemned by the European Union and the Arab League.[556]\nBefore and during his presidency, Trump has repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.[557] During his presidency, Trump has launched a trade war against China, sanctioned Huawei for its alleged ties to Iran,[558] significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese nationality students and scholars[559][560] and classified China as a \"currency manipulator\".[561] In the wake of the significant deterioration of relations, many political observers have warned against a new cold war between China and the U.S.[562][563][564]\nIn 2017, North Korea's nuclear weapons became increasingly seen as a serious threat to the United States.[565][566][567] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocations against the U.S. would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".[568] In response, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatened to direct a missile test toward Guam.[569]\nOn June 12, 2018, Trump and Kim held a summit in Singapore,[570] resulting in North Korea affirming its promise to work toward complete denuclearization.[571][572] A second summit took place in February 2019, in Hanoi, Vietnam.[573] It ended abruptly without an agreement, both sides blaming each other and offering differing accounts of the negotiations.[573][574][575] On June 30, 2019, Trump, Kim, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held brief talks in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, marking the first time a sitting U.S. president had set foot on North Korean soil. They agreed to resume negotiations.[576] Talks in Stockholm began on October 5, 2019, between U.S. and North Korean negotiating teams, but broke down after one day.[577]\nDuring his campaign and as president, Trump repeatedly said he wants better relations with Russia,[578][579] and he has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[580][581] He also said Russia could help the U.S. in its fight against ISIS.[582] According to Putin and some political experts and diplomats, the U.S.\u2013Russian relations, which were already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have further deteriorated since Trump took office in January 2017.[583][584][585]\nAfter Trump met Putin at the Helsinki Summit on July 16, 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for siding with Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of the United States intelligence community.[586][587][588]\nTrump has made both pro- and anti-Russia statements regarding Crimea,[589] Syria,[590] Ukraine,[591] North Korea,[592] Venezuela,[593] election meddling,[594] and Skripal poisoning.[595] Trump also said U.S. oil companies cannot resume oil drilling in Russia.[596]\nIn November 2017, the Trump administration tightened the rules on trade with Cuba and individual visits to the country, undoing the Obama administration's loosening of restrictions. According to an administration official, the new rules were intended to hinder trade with businesses with ties to the Cuban military, intelligence and security services.[597]\nOn August 11, 2017, Trump said he is \"not going to rule out a military option\" to confront the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.[598] In September 2018, Trump called \"for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela\" and said that \"socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty.\"[599] On January 23, 2019, Maduro announced that Venezuela was breaking ties with the United States following Trump's announcement of recognizing Juan Guaid\u00f3, the Venezuelan opposition leader, as the interim president of Venezuela.[600]\nAs a candidate, Trump questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[601] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[602] As president, he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO in March 2017.[603] However, he has repeatedly accused fellow NATO members of paying less than their fair share of the expenses of the alliance.[604]\nIn January 2019, The New York Times quoted senior administration officials as saying Trump has privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from NATO.[605] The next day Trump said the United States is going to \"be with NATO one hundred percent\" but repeated that the other countries have to \"step up\" and pay more.[606]\nThe Trump administration has been characterized by high turnover, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[607] As of early July\u00a02018[update], 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[608] and 141 staffers had left in the past year.[609] Both figures set a record for recent presidents\u00a0\u2013 more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[610] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Mike Flynn (after just 25 days in office), Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, replaced by retired Marine general John F. Kelly on July 28, 2017,[611] and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[610] Close personal aides to Trump such as Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee and Keith Schiller, have quit or been forced out.[612]\nTrump's cabinet nominations included U.S. senator from Alabama Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[613] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[614] retired Marine Corps general James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[615] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[616] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, such as neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[617] and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[618]\nTwo of Trump's 15 original cabinet members were gone within 15 months: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft, and Trump replaced Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo in March 2018 over disagreements on foreign policy.[619][612] EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in July 2018 amidst multiple investigations into his conduct,[620] while Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned five months later as he also faced multiple investigations.[621]\nTrump has been slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying that many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[622] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61%) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37%).[623]\nOn May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. He first attributed this action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[624] which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails.[625] On May 11, Trump said he was concerned with the ongoing \"Russia thing\"[626] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier, regardless of DOJ advice.[627]\nAccording to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he \"hoped\" Comey would drop the investigation into National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.[628]\nIn March and April, Trump had told Comey the ongoing suspicions formed a \"cloud\" impairing his presidency,[629] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[630] He also asked intelligence chiefs Dan Coats and Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[631] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[632] Comey eventually testified on June\u00a08 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[629][633]\nPresidential approval polls have shown him to be consistently unpopular.[634] His approval rating has been steady at around 40% with an unusually narrow margin between lowest and highest of \u00b15%.[635] Polls taken during the first ten months of Trump's term showed him to be the least popular U.S. president in the history of modern opinion polls,[636][637][638] and this has remained consistent, with the average of polls showing more than 50% disapproval since March 2017 with virtually no approval outside of Republican voters.[639] A Pew Research Center global poll conducted in July 2017, found \"a median of just 22 percent has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs\". This compares to a median of 64 percent rate of confidence for his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump received a higher rating in only two countries: Russia and Israel.[640] An August 2017 Politico/Morning Consult poll found on some measures \"that majorities of voters have low opinions of his character and competence\".[641] By December 2018, Trump's approval ratings, averaged over many polls, stood at roughly 42%, two points below Obama's at the same time in his presidency, and one point above Ronald Reagan's.[642] Trump's two-year average Gallup approval rating was the lowest of any president since World War II.[643]\nTrump came in second to Obama in Gallup's poll asking Americans to name the man they admired the most near the end of 2017[644][645] and 2018,[646][647][645] and tied with Obama for first place in 2019.[648][649][645] Trump is the first elected president to not place first in his first year in office.[648][649]\nAs president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[650][651][652] The statements have been documented by fact-checkers; academics and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics.[653][654][324] This trait of his was similarly observed when he was a presidential candidate.[655][656] His falsehoods have also become a distinctive part of his political identity.[654]\nTrump uttered \"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\" in office, according to The New York Times,[650] and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office, according to the \"Fact Checker\" political analysis column of The Washington Post.[657] By the Post's tally, it took Trump 601 days to reach 5,000 false or misleading statements and another 226 days to reach the 10,000 mark.[658] For the seven weeks leading up to the midterm elections, it rose to an average of thirty per day[659] from 4.9 during his first hundred days in office.[660] The Post's reported tally is 16,241 as of January 19, 2020, with the 2019 total more than double the cumulative total of 2017 and 2018.[661]\nTrump has made numerous comments and actions that have been characterized both within the U.S. and abroad as racially charged or racist.[662] Trump has repeatedly denied he is racist, asserting \"I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world\".[663] Many of his supporters say the way he speaks reflects his rejection of political correctness, while others accept it because they share such beliefs.[664][665]\nSeveral studies and surveys have found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascendance and have been more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[665][666] In a June 2018 Quinnipiac University poll, 49 percent of respondents believed he was racist, while 47 percent believed he was not.[667] Additionally, 55 percent said he \"has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly\".[668]\nIn 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[91] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. He has maintained his position on the matter into 2019.[669]\nTrump launched his political career in 2011 as a leading proponent of \"birther\" conspiracy theories alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.[670][671] In April 2011, Trump claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later saying this made him \"very popular\".[672][673] In September 2016, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[674]\nAccording to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist appeals to whites\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[675] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\".[676][677] His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding Trump University were also criticized as racist.[678]\nTrump's comments in reaction to the 2017 Charlottesville far-right rally were interpreted as implying a moral equivalence between white supremacist demonstrators and counter-protesters.[679]\nIn a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation, he reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[680] His remarks were condemned as racist worldwide, as well as by many members of Congress.[681][682]\nIn July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic members of Congress\u00a0\u2013 all four minority women, three of them native-born Americans\u00a0\u2013 should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[683] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240\u2013187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[684] White nationalist publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[685]\nTwenty-two women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct as of June\u00a02019[update]. There were allegations of rape, violence, being kissed and groped without consent, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked women.[686] In 2016, he denied all accusations, calling them \"false smears\", and alleged there was a conspiracy against him.[687][688][689]\nIn October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was recorded bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[690][691][692] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. In the tape, Trump said: \"I just start kissing them\u00a0... I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything\u00a0... grab 'em by the pussy.\"[693] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he \"moved on her very heavily\".[693]\nTrump's language on the tape has been described as vulgar, sexist, and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign,[694][695] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[696][697] resulting in a group of GOP senators and representatives withdrawing their support for his candidacy, some requesting that he step aside.[698][699] In addition to the two women who had previously alleged sexual misconduct against Trump, fifteen more came forward in 2016, during the aftermath of the tape's release with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping.[700][701][702] Trump publicly apologized for his inappropriate boasting on the tape but also defended it as \"locker room talk\",[703] and instead deflected his actions by asserting allegations of inappropriate behavior by Bill and Hillary Clinton.[704]\nSome research suggests Trump's rhetoric causes an increased incidence of hate crimes.[705][706][707] During the 2016 campaign, he sometimes urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[708][709] Since then, some individuals or their attorneys have cited Trump's rhetoric as a defense for their hate speech or violent actions.[710] In August 2019 it was reported that a man who allegedly assaulted a minor for perceived disrespect toward the national anthem had cited Trump's rhetoric in his own defense.[711] It was also reported in August 2019 that a nationwide review conducted by ABC News had identified at least 36 criminal cases where Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence. Of these, 29 were based around someone echoing presidential rhetoric, while the other seven were someone protesting it or not having direct linkage.[712]\nThroughout his career, Trump has sought media attention. His interactions with the press turned into what some sources called a \"love-hate\" relationship.[713][714][715] Trump began promoting himself in the press in the 1970s.[716] Fox News anchor Bret Baier and former House speaker Paul Ryan have characterized Trump as a \"troll\" who makes controversial statements to see people's \"heads explode\".[717][718]\nThroughout his 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency, Trump has repeatedly accused the press of intentionally misinterpreting his words and of being biased, calling them \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[314][719] In the campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[317] New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in September 2018 that one of the reasons for Trump's appeal was his media dominance. To answer the question of why the U.S. public could not stop being enthralled by his actions, she wrote \"Even in the so-called golden age of TV, Mr. Trump hasn't just dominated water-cooler conversation; he's sucked the water right out, making all other entertainment from N.F.L. games to awards shows pale in comparison.\"[720] Chozick quoted Brent Montgomery, the creator of the reality TV show Pawn Stars, saying \"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night. You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.\"[720]\nAfter winning the election, Trump told journalist Lesley Stahl he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[721] Into his presidency, Trump has described negative media coverage as \"fake news\".[722] Trump has privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' White House press credentials.[723] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[724] In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump.[725] The Trump White House held about 100 formal press briefings during 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two during 2019.[724]\nTrump has been the subject of comedians, Flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode \"Bart to the Future\", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017 on Comedy Central, while another one called Our Cartoon President debuted on Showtime in February 2018.[726]\nTrump's wealth and lifestyle had been a fixture of hip-hop lyrics since the 1980s, as he was named in hundreds of songs, most often in a positive tone.[727][728] Mentions of Trump turned negative and pejorative after he ran for office in 2015.[727]\nTrump's presence on social media has attracted attention worldwide since he joined Twitter in March 2009. He communicated heavily on Twitter during the 2016 election campaign, and has continued to use this channel during his presidency. The attention on Trump's Twitter activity has significantly increased since he was sworn in as president. As of May 2019, he is in the top 15 for most Twitter followers at more than 60\u00a0million.[729] Trump has frequently used Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public, sidelining the press.[730] Many of the assertions he tweeted have been proven false.[731][732][733]\nIn 1983, Trump received the Jewish National Fund Tree of Life Award, after he helped fund the building of two playgrounds, a park, and a reservoir in Israel.[734][735][735] In 1986, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of \"patriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity\",[736] and in 1995 was awarded the President's Medal from the Freedoms Foundation for his support of youth programs.[737] He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007,[738] and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013.[739] Liberty University awarded Trump an honorary Doctorate of Business in 2012[740] and an honorary Doctor of Laws in 2017, during his first college commencement speech as president.[741][742] In 2015, Robert Gordon University revoked the honorary Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) they had granted him in 2010, stating that \"Mr. Trump has made a number of statements that are wholly incompatible with the ethos and values of the university.\"[743]\nIn December 2016, Time named Trump as its \"Person of the Year\",[744] but Trump took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the \"President of the Divided States of America\".[745] In the same month, he was named Financial Times Person of the Year[746] and was ranked by Forbes the second most powerful person in the world after Vladimir Putin.[747] As president, Trump received the Collar of The Order of Abdulaziz al Saud from Saudi Arabia in 2017.[748]\nThe Crossfire Hurricane FBI investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign was launched in mid-2016 during the campaign season. Since he assumed the presidency, Trump has been the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[84] The New York Times reported in May 2019 that there were 29 open investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and eleven Congressional investigations.[749]\nAmerican Media, Inc. (AMI) paid $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal in August 2016,[750] and Trump's attorney Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in October 2016.[751] Both women were paid for non-disclosure agreements regarding their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[752] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged the payments at the direction of Trump in order to influence the presidential election.[753] AMI admitted paying McDougal to prevent publication of stories that might damage Trump's electoral chances.[754] Trump denied the affairs, and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but reimbursed him in 2017.[755][756] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[757] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[758][759] The closure of the federal investigation into the matter was announced in July 2019,[760] but days later the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the hush payments[761] and in August subpoenaed eight years of tax returns for Trump and the Trump Organization.[762]\nIn January 2017, American intelligence agencies\u00a0\u2013 the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence\u00a0\u2013 jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[763][764] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that \"the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[765]\nThe connections between Trump associates and Russia have been widely reported by the press.[766][767] One of Trump's campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency.[768] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[769][770] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[771]\nMembers of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[772] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that had been imposed the same day; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[773] The Washington Post reported that Trump had told Sergei Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[774]\nTrump and his allies have promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election, which has also been promoted by Russia in an effort to frame Ukraine.[775]\nOn May 17, 2017, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) investigating \"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\",[776][777] thus taking over the existing FBI investigation into the matter.[777] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice, and possible campaign ties to other national governments.[778] Trump repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and the Russian government.[779]\nTrump sought to fire Mueller on several occasions\u00a0\u2013 in June 2017, December 2017, and April 2018\u00a0\u2013 and close the investigation, but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[780] He tried repeatedly to get former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to withdraw his recusal regarding Russia matters, believing Sessions would then put an end to the special counsel investigation.[781]\nOn March 22, 2019, the special counsel concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr.[782] On March 24, Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress summarizing what he said were the \"principal conclusions\" in the report. He said the report did not conclude the President had committed any crimes, although it did not exonerate him for obstruction of justice.[783] Barr wrote on March 24 that given his authority to decide whether Trump had committed a crime, he and Rosenstein felt there was insufficient evidence to establish obstruction by Trump.[783] Trump interpreted Mueller's report a \"complete exoneration\", a phrase he repeated multiple times in the ensuing weeks.[784] Mueller privately complained to Barr on March 27 that his summary did not accurately reflect what the report said and there was now \"public confusion\".[785] Some legal analysts said Barr's description of the report's contents was misleading.[786]\nA redacted version of the final Mueller Report was released to the public on April 18, 2019, with the first volume finding that Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's.[787] Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[788][789] The evidence was incomplete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony.[790] The report states that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was illegal and occurred \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\" and details how Trump and his campaign \"welcomed and encouraged\" Russian foreign interference under the belief that they would politically benefit.[776][791][792][793][794]\nThe second volume of the Mueller Report dealt with possible obstruction of justice by Trump.[795] The report did not exonerate him of obstruction, saying investigators were not confident of his innocence after examining his intent and actions.[796] Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\", as they could not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, and would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[797] The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[798]\nOn August 21, 2018, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted on eight felony counts of false tax filing and bank fraud.[799] Trump said he felt very badly for Manafort and praised him for resisting the pressure to make a deal with prosecutors, saying \"Such respect for a brave man!\" According to Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, Trump had sought advice about pardoning Manafort but was counseled against it.[800]\nOn November 29, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as \"Individual-1\" in the court documents.[801]\nThe five Trump associates who have pleaded guilty or have been convicted in Mueller's investigation or related cases include Paul Manafort, deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen.[802][803] On January 25, 2019, Trump adviser Roger Stone was arrested at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and indicted on seven criminal charges;[804] he was convicted in November of that year.[805]\nIn March 2019, the House Judiciary Committee launched a broad investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice, corruption, and abuse of power.[806] Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler sent letters demanding documents to 81 individuals and organizations associated with Trump's presidency, business, and private life, saying it is \"very clear that the president obstructed justice\".[807][808] Three other committee chairmen wrote the White House and State Department requesting details of Trump's communications with Putin, including any efforts to conceal the content of those communications.[808] The White House refused to comply with that request, asserting that presidential communications with foreign leaders are protected and confidential.[809]\nImpeachment and trial is a process under the United States Constitution whereby the legislature can remove from office a president, cabinet member, judge, or other civil officer.[810] The House of Representatives investigates the case; if the House votes to bring charges, that is an impeachment. There is then a trial in the Senate; a two-thirds vote is required to remove the person from office.[811]\nDuring much of Trump's presidency, Democrats were divided on the question of impeachment.[812] Fewer than 20 representatives in the House supported impeachment by January 2019; after the Mueller Report was released in April and special counsel Robert Mueller testified in July, this number grew to around 140 representatives.[813]\nIn August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump had pressured Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential primary candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, that the White House attempted to \"lock down\" the call records in a cover-up.[814] The whistleblower further stated that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Giuliani and the Trump administration which may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Vice President Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.[815] Trump later confirmed having withheld military aid from Ukraine and offered contradicting reasons for the decision.[816][817][818]\nAfter the whistleblower complaint became known in September 2019, House speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[819][820] The Trump administration subsequently released a memorandum of the July 25 phone call, confirming that after Zelensky mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate and to discuss these matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.[814][821] According to the testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials, the events were part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[822]\nAs a result, House speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24.[819][820] The Trump administration subsequently released a memorandum of the July 25 phone call, confirming that after Zelensky mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked Zelensky to discuss the matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.[814][821]\nAmong several State Department employees testifying to congressional committees in October 2019, William Taylor, the charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine, testified that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelensky was being subjected to pressure from a private initiative directed by Trump and led by Giuliani.  According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelensky into making a public commitment to investigate the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[823] He said it was made clear that until Zelensky made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelensky to the White House.[824][825] Zelensky denied that he felt pressured by Trump.[826]\nOn December 3, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee published a report authored by Democrats on the committee, stating that \"the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.\" The report stated that Trump withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political rivals. Furthermore, the report described Trump was the only U.S. president thus far to have \"openly and indiscriminately\" defied impeachment proceedings by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony.[827][828][829]:8,208 The Republicans of the House Committees had released a draft of a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence \"does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor.\"[830][831]\nOn December 13, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.[832] After debate, the House of Representatives impeached Trump with both articles on December 18.[833]\nThe Senate impeachment trial began on January 16, 2020.[834] On January 22, 2020, the Republican Senate majority rejected amendments proposed by the Democratic minority to call witnesses and subpoena documents; evidence collected during the House impeachment proceedings will be entered into the Senate record automatically unless objected to on a case-by-case basis.[835] For the three days, January 22\u201324, the impeachment managers for the House presented their case to the Senate. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they included an impeachment process in the Constitution.[836] Responding over the next three days, the Trump legal team did not deny the facts as presented in the charges, but stated that Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[837] They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because Trump was not charged with a crime; that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense; and that Trump therefore should be acquitted immediately.[837] January 29 and 30 were devoted to written questions from senators.[838] On January 31 the Senate voted against calling any witnesses.[839] The vote on whether to convict the president is scheduled for February 5.[840]\n*\u00a0: These candidates are constitutionally ineligible to serve as President or Vice President.\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nDonald John Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977) is an American businessman and former reality television personality. He is the eldest child of US president Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana. A fourth-generation businessman (following his great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father), Trump Jr. currently serves as a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his younger brother Eric.[2] During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so.[3] He also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice. Trump Jr. has also been active politically, serving in his father's presidential campaign. He had a meeting with a Russian lawyer, who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[4][5][6] He is notorious for promoting conspiracy theories and false information.[7][8][9] As of May 2019, Trump Jr. is under investigation by the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, with Ivanka and Eric Trump, for their role in their father's inauguration.[10] He is also under investigation, along with Allen Weisselberg, for a possible role in concealing hush money payments and signed checks reimbursing per Michael Cohen regarding his father and the Trump Organization, by the Southern District of New York.[10] Trump Jr. was born on December 31, 1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump.[11] He has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through his father, Trump Jr. is a grandson of Fred Trump and great-grandson of Elizabeth Trump, who founded what became the Trump Organization. As a boy, Trump Jr. found a role model in his maternal grandfather, Milo\u0161 Zeln\u00ed\u010dek, who had a home near Prague, where he spent summers camping, fishing, hunting and learning the Czech language.[12] Trump's parents divorced when he was 13 years old. His mother told him his father was having an extramarital affair. Trump was estranged from his father for one year after the divorce, furious at his actions which broke up the family.[13] Trump Jr. was educated at Buckley School[14][15] and the Hill School, a college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, followed by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, where he graduated in 2000 with a B.S. in Economics.[16] After graduating from Penn in 2000, Trump moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, skied, lived in a truck, and worked as a bartender for a year, before returning to join the Trump Organization in New York. Trump has supervised building projects, which included 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Park Avenue,[17] In 2006 he helped launch Trump Mortgage, which collapsed less than a year later.[11] In 2010 he became a spokesperson for Cambridge Who's Who, a public relations firm that had received hundreds of complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau.[11] He appeared as a guest adviser and judge on many episodes of his father's reality television show The Apprentice, from season 5 in 2006 to his father's last season in 2015.[18] On January 11, 2017, Trump's father announced that he and his brother Eric would oversee a trust that included the Trump Organization's assets while his father was president, in order to avert a conflict of interest.[19] Amid the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal \u2013 where Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u00a0\u2013 Trump Jr. strongly criticized Hunter Biden, accusing him of nepotism and leveraging his father as a means to get financial benefits. Trump Jr. said, \"When you're the father and your son's entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\" Trump Jr. was widely ridiculed for these remarks by Trevor Noah and others. Trump Jr. is a top executive in his father's business and has continued to operate and promote the family's businesses across the world during Trump's presidency.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The Associated Press wrote of Trump Jr.'s, remarks that he was \"showing no self-awareness that he, too, has at least in part been successful because of a famous father\".[26] According to the Washington Post fact-checker, Trump Jr.'s assertion that he and his family members had gotten out of foreign business deals after Trump became president is false.[3] The Washington Post noted that after Trump became president, \"Trump's sons have been busy selling assets to foreign individuals, expanding or adding onto their existing deals and investments in foreign countries, and collecting payments in U.S. properties from foreign governments.\"[3] In February 2018, advertisements in Indian newspapers promoted a deal whereby anyone who purchased Trump Organization apartments in Gurgaon before February 20 would be invited to have a \"conversation and dinner\" with Trump Jr. The ads were criticized by corruption watchdogs as unethical.[27][28] Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump Jr. was a key member of his father's campaign,[29] characterized by The New York Times as a \"close political adviser\".[30] He spoke at the Republican National Convention, along with his siblings Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany.[30] Trump Jr. influenced his father's choice of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke during the presidential transition.[31][32] Since his father's victory in the 2016 election, Trump Jr. has developed what The Washington Post calls a \"public persona as a right-wing provocateur and ardent defender of Trumpism\".[33] On June 9, 2016, Trump Jr. attended a meeting arranged by publicist Rob Goldstone on behalf of Azerbaijani-Russian businessman Emin Agalarov.[34] The meeting was held in Trump Tower in Manhattan, among three members of the presidential campaign: Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort\u00a0\u2013 and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, her translator Anatoli Samochornov, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and Ike Kaveladze, a Georgian-American, U.S.-based senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development company run by Aras Agalarov.[34] Approximately a year later, Trump Jr. initially told the media that adoption of Russian children was the main subject of the meeting.[35] On July 8, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted his email exchange with Goldstone. It revealed that Trump Jr. had agreed to attend the meeting with the understanding he would receive information damaging to Hillary Clinton, which he considered opposition research.[36][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Goldstone also wrote in one of Trump Jr.'s publicly disclosed emails that the Russian government was involved.[36] Robert Mueller, the special counsel of the Department of Justice in charge of Russia-related investigations, investigated the emails and the meeting.[37] Although the White House lauded Trump Jr. for his transparency, he released the e-mails only after The New York Times had informed him that they had them and were going to publish a story about them.[38] Trump Jr. had a meeting in August 2016 with emissary for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[39] The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation; George Nader, an envoy representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia; and American businessman Erik Prince.[40][39] In November 2017, news broke that Julian Assange had used the WikiLeaks Twitter account to corresponded with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. Trump Jr. had already provided this correspondence to congressional investigators who were looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[41][42][43] The correspondence showed that WikiLeaks actively solicited the cooperation of Trump Jr., who was a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it appeared the Trump campaign would lose. WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share an unsubstantiated[44] claim that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack Assange with drones. WikiLeaks also shared a link to a website that would help people search through Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's hacked e-mails, which Wikileaks had recently made public. Trump Jr. shared both.[41][42] During the 2018 midterms election cycle, Trump actively campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates, including for Matt Rosendale, Patrick Morrisey, Mike Braun, Ron DeSantis, Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz.[45] He raised millions of dollars for Republican candidates, was second only to his father in his ability to draw crows to draw campaign events, and is credited with helping Republican candidates win.[46] In 2011, Trump Jr. responded to criticism of the Tea Party movement by Florida Representative Frederica Wilson by confusing Wilson with California Representative Maxine Waters and saying her colorful hats made her look like a stripper.[47] In April 2017, he campaigned for Montana congressional candidate Greg Gianforte,[48] and in May met with Republican National Committee officials to discuss the party's strategy and resources.[49] In September 2017, Trump Jr. asked to have his Secret Service detail removed, telling friends he wanted more privacy. The request was criticized by former Secret Service agents.[50] Trump Jr.'s protection was restored later that month.[51] During his father's presidential campaign, Trump Jr. caused controversy in 2016 when he posted an image that compared refugees to Skittles, saying \"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\"[30][52][53] The makers of Skittles condemned the tweet, saying \"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\"[53][30] The Cato Institute reported that year that the chances \"an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was one in 3.64 billion\" per year.[54] On March 1, 2016, an interview with white supremacist James Edwards and Trump Jr. was aired. The campaign initially denied the interview had taken place; later Trump Jr. claimed it was unintentional.[55] As a consequence of the interview, mainstream media outlets have accused Trump Jr. of being either a believer in the white genocide conspiracy theory,[56] or pretending to be an advocate for political gain.[57] In September 2016, Trump Jr. cited Holocaust imagery to criticize what he perceived as the mainstream media's seemingly uncritical coverage of Hillary Clinton during her campaign, by \"letting her slide on every discrepancy\", while also accusing Democrats involved in the 2016 campaign of lying. Trump Jr. said if the Republicans were committing the same offences mainstream outlets would be \"...\u00a0warming up the gas chamber right now.\"[58][59] Also that month, Trump Jr. shared an image on Instagram depicting a cross between his father and Pepe the Frog. When asked on Good Morning America about Pepe the Frog and its associations with white supremacy, Trump Jr. said he had never heard of Pepe the Frog and thought it was just a \"frog with a wig\".[60] In April 2017, Trump Jr. lauded Mike Cernovich, who promotes the white genocide and debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theories,[61] saying, \"In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he'd win the Pulitzer\".[62][63] Trump Jr. retweeted conspiratorial remarks by white supremacist Kevin B. MacDonald about alleged favors exchanged by Hillary Clinton and Switzerland's largest bank.[30] On the campaign trail, Trump Jr. promoted Alex Jones' conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton wore an earpiece to a presidential forum[64][65][66] and that official unemployment rates were manipulated for political purposes.[67] In March 2017, Trump Jr. criticized the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, after the 2017 Westminster attack, which in turn led British lawmakers to criticize Trump Jr.[68][69][70] British journalists said Trump Jr. had quoted Khan out of context when he criticized him.[69][70] Khan did not respond to the criticism, saying he had \"far more important things\" to do.[68] In May 2017, Trump Jr. promoted what CNN called the \"long-debunked, far-right conspiracy theory\" that Bill Clinton was linked to Vince Foster's death.[71] In November, Trump Jr. again promoted the conspiracy theory that the Clintons murdered people.[72] In February 2018, Trump Jr. liked two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory that survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting were coached into propagating anti-Trump rhetoric.[73][74] In May 2018, Trump Jr. retweeted a false and antisemitic conspiracy theory that George Soros, the Jewish Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist, was a \"nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth\".[75][11][76] The tweets originated from Roseanne Barr, whose TV show was cancelled the same day for posting a series of racist and antisemitic tweets.[75] George Soros's spokesperson responded to the tweets, \"George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13-year-old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive the Holocaust.\"[76] In June 2018, Trump Jr. liked a tweet suggesting that the migrant children separated from their parents due to the Trump administration family separation policy were actually actors.[77] In August 2018, Trump Jr. shared on Instagram of a doctored image which had been crudely edited to falsely state that CNN had reported President Trump's approval rating as 50%. The actual CNN report had Trump at 40%, below Obama's 45% at the same point of his presidency. Trump Jr. deleted the image two days later.[78][79] In September 2018, when Hurricane Florence was affecting the United States, Trump Jr. tweeted a picture of CNN journalist Anderson Cooper waist-deep in floodwaters when another man in the same picture was standing knee-deep a distance away. Trump Jr. then proposed a conspiracy theory that CNN was \"lying to try to make [his father, President Trump] look bad\". In actuality, the picture of Cooper was around ten years old, taken during 2008's Hurricane Ike before Trump became president, and Cooper was videoed talking about how the floodwaters were receding.[80] On October 31, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted that he would take away half his three-year-old daughter's Halloween candy because, he wrote, \"it's never too early to teach her about socialism.\"[81] On November 7, 2017, he posted tweets urging voters in Virginia's gubernatorial election to vote \"tomorrow\", the day after the election.[82] In November 2019, Trump Jr. tweeted the name of the alleged whistleblower who brought to light the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Whistleblower conventions are intended to protect the identity of individuals who expose wrongdoing in government. Agence France-Presse attempted to independently verify the identity that Trump Jr. tweeted, but was unable to do so.[83] In 2019, Trump Jr. released the book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. The book is critical of political correctness, and argues that the American left has a victimhood complex.[84] The Washington Post noted, \"yet, in his telling, the real victim is often him, his father or another Trump family member.\"[84] In the book, Trump Jr. pushes conspiracy theories about how the intelligence community has attempted to harm President Trump, comparing President Trump's experiences with the FBI harassment campaign against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.[85] Trump Jr. also writes about a visit to Arlington National Cemetery (a military cemetery), saying he got emotional looking at the graves and that it reminded him of \"all the sacrifices\" the Trump family had made, including \"voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were 'profiting off of the office'\".[84][85] Fact-checkers have noted that Trump still owns the family business, and that the Trump family have continued to engage in international business deals since Trump became president.[84] In a review for The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada said, \"fails as memoir and as polemic: Its analysis is facile, its hypocrisy relentless, its self-awareness marginal. (The writing is wretched, even by the standards of political vanity projects.)\"[86] The book was a New York Times best-seller. The book was purchased in bulk by at least nine Republican organizations, candidates or advocacy groups, including N.R.C.C. and the R.N.C. which bought $75,000 and $100,000 worth of the books, respectively. Turning Point USA and the National Republican Senatorial Committee purchased approximately 2,000 and 2,500 books, respectively.[87] In 2003, Trump Jr. began dating model Vanessa Kay Haydon at his father's suggestion.[11] The couple married on November 12, 2005, at his father's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; the service was officiated by Trump Jr.'s aunt, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry.[88] Haydon's grandfather was Danish jazz musician Kai Ewans.[89][90][91][92] They have five children.[93][94] On March 15, 2018, it was announced that the couple had separated and she had filed for uncontested divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court.[95][96][97] However, later it was revealed that the divorce is contested.[98] The complaint is secret except for the title of the case.[99] On February 22, 2019, they announced that they settled their divorce at the end of 2018.[100] Since 2018, Trump has been dating Kimberly Guilfoyle.[46][101] Guilfoyle had been friends with the Trump family for years.[102] Trump Jr. is an enthusiastic hunter. Controversy erupted in 2012 when the pictures he had taken of his hunting trophies in 2010 were published. In one photo, Trump Jr. has his arms around a dead leopard; in another, he is holding a knife in one hand and a bloody elephant tail in the other. Although the hunt was legal, anti-hunting activists criticized him. At least one sponsor dropped his father's TV show The Celebrity Apprentice.[103] On Earth Day in 2017, Trump Jr. legally hunted prairie dogs in Montana with GOP Congressional candidate Greg Gianforte.[104] President Trump reversed the decision to allow elephant trophies imported from Zambia and Zimbabwe, pending further review.[105] ProPublica revealed on December 11, 2019, that the government of Mongolia retroactively granted Donald Trump Jr. a hunting permit for the endangered Argali mountain sheep.[106]",

He is the eldest child of US president Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana.\nA fourth-generation businessman (following his great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father), Trump Jr. currently serves as a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his younger brother Eric.[2] During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so.[3] He also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice.\nTrump Jr. has also been active politically, serving in his father's presidential campaign. He had a meeting with a Russian lawyer, who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[4][5][6] He is notorious for promoting conspiracy theories and false information.[7][8][9] As of May 2019, Trump Jr. is under investigation by the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, with Ivanka and Eric Trump, for their role in their father's inauguration.[10] He is also under investigation, along with Allen Weisselberg, for a possible role in concealing hush money payments and signed checks reimbursing per Michael Cohen regarding his father and the Trump Organization, by the Southern District of New York.[10]\nTrump Jr. was born on December 31, 1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump.[11] He has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through his father, Trump Jr. is a grandson of Fred Trump and great-grandson of Elizabeth Trump, who founded what became the Trump Organization. As a boy, Trump Jr. found a role model in his maternal grandfather, Milo\u0161 Zeln\u00ed\u010dek, who had a home near Prague, where he spent summers camping, fishing, hunting and learning the Czech language.[12]\nTrump's parents divorced when he was 13 years old. His mother told him his father was having an extramarital affair. Trump was estranged from his father for one year after the divorce, furious at his actions which broke up the family.[13]\nTrump Jr. was educated at Buckley School[14][15] and the Hill School, a college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, followed by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, where he graduated in 2000 with a B.S. in Economics.[16]\nAfter graduating from Penn in 2000, Trump moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, skied, lived in a truck, and worked as a bartender for a year, before returning to join the Trump Organization in New York. Trump has supervised building projects, which included 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Park Avenue,[17] In 2006 he helped launch Trump Mortgage, which collapsed less than a year later.[11] In 2010 he became a spokesperson for Cambridge Who's Who, a public relations firm that had received hundreds of complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau.[11] He appeared as a guest adviser and judge on many episodes of his father's reality television show The Apprentice, from season 5 in 2006 to his father's last season in 2015.[18]\nOn January 11, 2017, Trump's father announced that he and his brother Eric would oversee a trust that included the Trump Organization's assets while his father was president, in order to avert a conflict of interest.[19]\nAmid the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal \u2013 where Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u00a0\u2013 Trump Jr. strongly criticized Hunter Biden, accusing him of nepotism and leveraging his father as a means to get financial benefits. Trump Jr. said, \"When you're the father and your son's entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\" Trump Jr. was widely ridiculed for these remarks by Trevor Noah and others. Trump Jr. is a top executive in his father's business and has continued to operate and promote the family's businesses across the world during Trump's presidency.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The Associated Press wrote of Trump Jr.'s, remarks that he was \"showing no self-awareness that he, too, has at least in part been successful because of a famous father\".[26] According to the Washington Post fact-checker, Trump Jr.'s assertion that he and his family members had gotten out of foreign business deals after Trump became president is false.[3] The Washington Post noted that after Trump became president, \"Trump's sons have been busy selling assets to foreign individuals, expanding or adding onto their existing deals and investments in foreign countries, and collecting payments in U.S. properties from foreign governments.\"[3]\nIn February 2018, advertisements in Indian newspapers promoted a deal whereby anyone who purchased Trump Organization apartments in Gurgaon before February 20 would be invited to have a \"conversation and dinner\" with Trump Jr. The ads were criticized by corruption watchdogs as unethical.[27][28]\nAhead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump Jr. was a key member of his father's campaign,[29] characterized by The New York Times as a \"close political adviser\".[30] He spoke at the Republican National Convention, along with his siblings Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany.[30]\nTrump Jr. influenced his father's choice of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke during the presidential transition.[31][32] Since his father's victory in the 2016 election, Trump Jr. has developed what The Washington Post calls a \"public persona as a right-wing provocateur and ardent defender of Trumpism\".[33]\nOn June 9, 2016, Trump Jr. attended a meeting arranged by publicist Rob Goldstone on behalf of Azerbaijani-Russian businessman Emin Agalarov.[34] The meeting was held in Trump Tower in Manhattan, among three members of the presidential campaign: Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort\u00a0\u2013 and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, her translator Anatoli Samochornov, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and Ike Kaveladze, a Georgian-American, U.S.-based senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development company run by Aras Agalarov.[34]\nApproximately a year later, Trump Jr. initially told the media that adoption of Russian children was the main subject of the meeting.[35] On July 8, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted his email exchange with Goldstone. It revealed that Trump Jr. had agreed to attend the meeting with the understanding he would receive information damaging to Hillary Clinton, which he considered opposition research.[36][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Goldstone also wrote in one of Trump Jr.'s publicly disclosed emails that the Russian government was involved.[36] Robert Mueller, the special counsel of the Department of Justice in charge of Russia-related investigations, investigated the emails and the meeting.[37] Although the White House lauded Trump Jr. for his transparency, he released the e-mails only after The New York Times had informed him that they had them and were going to publish a story about them.[38]\nTrump Jr. had a meeting in August 2016 with emissary for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[39] The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation; George Nader, an envoy representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia; and American businessman Erik Prince.[40][39]\nIn November 2017, news broke that Julian Assange had used the WikiLeaks Twitter account to corresponded with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. Trump Jr. had already provided this correspondence to congressional investigators who were looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[41][42][43]\nThe correspondence showed that WikiLeaks actively solicited the cooperation of Trump Jr., who was a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it appeared the Trump campaign would lose. WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share an unsubstantiated[44] claim that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack Assange with drones. WikiLeaks also shared a link to a website that would help people search through Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's hacked e-mails, which Wikileaks had recently made public. Trump Jr. shared both.[41][42]\nDuring the 2018 midterms election cycle, Trump actively campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates, including for Matt Rosendale, Patrick Morrisey, Mike Braun, Ron DeSantis, Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz.[45] He raised millions of dollars for Republican candidates, was second only to his father in his ability to draw crows to draw campaign events, and is credited with helping Republican candidates win.[46]\nIn 2011, Trump Jr. responded to criticism of the Tea Party movement by Florida Representative Frederica Wilson by confusing Wilson with California Representative Maxine Waters and saying her colorful hats made her look like a stripper.[47]\nIn April 2017, he campaigned for Montana congressional candidate Greg Gianforte,[48] and in May met with Republican National Committee officials to discuss the party's strategy and resources.[49]\nIn September 2017, Trump Jr. asked to have his Secret Service detail removed, telling friends he wanted more privacy. The request was criticized by former Secret Service agents.[50] Trump Jr.'s protection was restored later that month.[51]\nDuring his father's presidential campaign, Trump Jr. caused controversy in 2016 when he posted an image that compared refugees to Skittles, saying \"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\"[30][52][53] The makers of Skittles condemned the tweet, saying \"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\"[53][30] The Cato Institute reported that year that the chances \"an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was one in 3.64 billion\" per year.[54]\nOn March 1, 2016, an interview with white supremacist James Edwards and Trump Jr. was aired. The campaign initially denied the interview had taken place; later Trump Jr. claimed it was unintentional.[55] As a consequence of the interview, mainstream media outlets have accused Trump Jr. of being either a believer in the white genocide conspiracy theory,[56] or pretending to be an advocate for political gain.[57]\nIn September 2016, Trump Jr. cited Holocaust imagery to criticize what he perceived as the mainstream media's seemingly uncritical coverage of Hillary Clinton during her campaign, by \"letting her slide on every discrepancy\", while also accusing Democrats involved in the 2016 campaign of lying. Trump Jr. said if the Republicans were committing the same offences mainstream outlets would be \"...\u00a0warming up the gas chamber right now.\"[58][59] Also that month, Trump Jr. shared an image on Instagram depicting a cross between his father and Pepe the Frog. When asked on Good Morning America about Pepe the Frog and its associations with white supremacy, Trump Jr. said he had never heard of Pepe the Frog and thought it was just a \"frog with a wig\".[60]\nIn April 2017, Trump Jr. lauded Mike Cernovich, who promotes the white genocide and debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theories,[61] saying, \"In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he'd win the Pulitzer\".[62][63]\nTrump Jr. retweeted conspiratorial remarks by white supremacist Kevin B. MacDonald about alleged favors exchanged by Hillary Clinton and Switzerland's largest bank.[30] On the campaign trail, Trump Jr. promoted Alex Jones' conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton wore an earpiece to a presidential forum[64][65][66] and that official unemployment rates were manipulated for political purposes.[67]\nIn March 2017, Trump Jr. criticized the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, after the 2017 Westminster attack, which in turn led British lawmakers to criticize Trump Jr.[68][69][70] British journalists said Trump Jr. had quoted Khan out of context when he criticized him.[69][70] Khan did not respond to the criticism, saying he had \"far more important things\" to do.[68]\nIn May 2017, Trump Jr. promoted what CNN called the \"long-debunked, far-right conspiracy theory\" that Bill Clinton was linked to Vince Foster's death.[71] In November, Trump Jr. again promoted the conspiracy theory that the Clintons murdered people.[72]\nIn February 2018, Trump Jr. liked two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory that survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting were coached into propagating anti-Trump rhetoric.[73][74]\nIn May 2018, Trump Jr. retweeted a false and antisemitic conspiracy theory that George Soros, the Jewish Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist, was a \"nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps &amp; stole their wealth\".[75][11][76] The tweets originated from Roseanne Barr, whose TV show was cancelled the same day for posting a series of racist and antisemitic tweets.[75] George Soros's spokesperson responded to the tweets, \"George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13-year-old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive the Holocaust.\"[76]\nIn June 2018, Trump Jr. liked a tweet suggesting that the migrant children separated from their parents due to the Trump administration family separation policy were actually actors.[77]\nIn August 2018, Trump Jr. shared on Instagram of a doctored image which had been crudely edited to falsely state that CNN had reported President Trump's approval rating as 50%. The actual CNN report had Trump at 40%, below Obama's 45% at the same point of his presidency. Trump Jr. deleted the image two days later.[78][79]\nIn September 2018, when Hurricane Florence was affecting the United States, Trump Jr. tweeted a picture of CNN journalist Anderson Cooper waist-deep in floodwaters when another man in the same picture was standing knee-deep a distance away. Trump Jr. then proposed a conspiracy theory that CNN was \"lying to try to make [his father, President Trump] look bad\". In actuality, the picture of Cooper was around ten years old, taken during 2008's Hurricane Ike before Trump became president, and Cooper was videoed talking about how the floodwaters were receding.[80]\nOn October 31, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted that he would take away half his three-year-old daughter's Halloween candy because, he wrote, \"it's never too early to teach her about socialism.\"[81]\nOn November 7, 2017, he posted tweets urging voters in Virginia's gubernatorial election to vote \"tomorrow\", the day after the election.[82]\nIn November 2019, Trump Jr. tweeted the name of the alleged whistleblower who brought to light the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Whistleblower conventions are intended to protect the identity of individuals who expose wrongdoing in government. Agence France-Presse attempted to independently verify the identity that Trump Jr. tweeted, but was unable to do so.[83]\nIn 2019, Trump Jr. released the book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. The book is critical of political correctness, and argues that the American left has a victimhood complex.[84] The Washington Post noted, \"yet, in his telling, the real victim is often him, his father or another Trump family member.\"[84] In the book, Trump Jr. pushes conspiracy theories about how the intelligence community has attempted to harm President Trump, comparing President Trump's experiences with the FBI harassment campaign against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.[85] Trump Jr. also writes about a visit to Arlington National Cemetery (a military cemetery), saying he got emotional looking at the graves and that it reminded him of \"all the sacrifices\" the Trump family had made, including \"voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were 'profiting off of the office'\".[84][85] Fact-checkers have noted that Trump still owns the family business, and that the Trump family have continued to engage in international business deals since Trump became president.[84] In a review for The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada said, \"fails as memoir and as polemic: Its analysis is facile, its hypocrisy relentless, its self-awareness marginal. (The writing is wretched, even by the standards of political vanity projects.)\"[86]\nThe book was a New York Times best-seller. The book was purchased in bulk by at least nine Republican organizations, candidates or advocacy groups, including N.R.C.C. and the R.N.C. which bought $75,000 and $100,000 worth of the books, respectively. Turning Point USA and the National Republican Senatorial Committee purchased approximately 2,000 and 2,500 books, respectively.[87]\nIn 2003, Trump Jr. began dating model Vanessa Kay Haydon at his father's suggestion.[11] The couple married on November 12, 2005, at his father's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; the service was officiated by Trump Jr.'s aunt, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry.[88] Haydon's grandfather was Danish jazz musician Kai Ewans.[89][90][91][92] They have five children.[93][94]\nOn March 15, 2018, it was announced that the couple had separated and she had filed for uncontested divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court.[95][96][97] However, later it was revealed that the divorce is contested.[98] The complaint is secret except for the title of the case.[99] On February 22, 2019, they announced that they settled their divorce at the end of 2018.[100]\nSince 2018, Trump has been dating Kimberly Guilfoyle.[46][101] Guilfoyle had been friends with the Trump family for years.[102]\nTrump Jr. is an enthusiastic hunter. Controversy erupted in 2012 when the pictures he had taken of his hunting trophies in 2010 were published. In one photo, Trump Jr. has his arms around a dead leopard; in another, he is holding a knife in one hand and a bloody elephant tail in the other. Although the hunt was legal, anti-hunting activists criticized him. At least one sponsor dropped his father's TV show The Celebrity Apprentice.[103] On Earth Day in 2017, Trump Jr. legally hunted prairie dogs in Montana with GOP Congressional candidate Greg Gianforte.[104] President Trump reversed the decision to allow elephant trophies imported from Zambia and Zimbabwe, pending further review.[105]\nProPublica revealed on December 11, 2019, that the government of Mongolia retroactively granted Donald Trump Jr. a hunting permit for the endangered Argali mountain sheep.[106]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nEric Frederick Trump[3] (born January 6, 1984)[4] is an American businessman, philanthropist, and former reality television personality. He is the third child and second son of President Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump. A fourth generation businessman (following his great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father), he is a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his older brother Donald Jr.[5] During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so.[6] He also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice. Eric Trump is under United States Attorney for the District of Columbia's investigation along with his sister Ivanka for their role in their father's inauguration.[7] Eric Trump was born in New York City and attended Trinity School.[3] His parents divorced in 1992, when he was eight years old. As a young boy, Trump spent his summers in the Czech countryside near Zlin with his maternal grandparents. His grandfather, Milos Zelnicek, who died in 1990, was an engineer; his grandmother, Maria, was a worker in a shoe factory. His grandfather taught Trump how to hunt and fish.[8] In 2002, he graduated from the Hill School and subsequently served on its board until 2013.[9][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] He graduated with a degree in finance and management, with honors, from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.[10][11] Trump started accompanying his father to job sites and negotiations from a very young age. Later in his youth he spent summers mowing lawns, laying tile, cutting rebar, hanging chandeliers, and performing various other work at his father's properties. Trump briefly considered other careers but decided to join the family business while he was a high school student.[11] Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions of the Trump Organization.[11] He worked with his sister, Ivanka, to redesign and renovate Trump National Doral and its Blue Monster course in Miami, Florida.[12] In 2013, Trump received Wine Enthusiast Magazine's \"Rising Star of the Year\" Award.[13] Amid the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal\u2014where President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter\u2014Eric Trump strongly criticized Hunter, accusing him of nepotism. Eric claimed that, unlike Hunter, \"When my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals.\" However, when Donald Trump became president, rather than place his assets in a blind trust, he made Eric a top executive in the family business, which continues to operate and promote deals across the world.[14][15][16][17][18][19] PolitiFact and the Washington Post fact-checker rated Eric Trump's assertion that the Trump family \"got out of all international business\" as false.[20][21] PolitiFact noted that not only has the Trump family engaged in international business dealings since Trump became president, but that some of the Trump children, including Eric, have openly celebrated their international business activities during that time.[20] In October 2019, Eric Trump complained about the Bidens, \"Why is it that every family goes into politics and enriches themselves?\" Shortly before he made that statement, President Trump had decided that the G-7 summit would be held at the Trump Doral resort, which was owned by the Trump family business. President Trump reversed his decision amid bipartisan condemnation from Republicans and Democrats.[22][23] He was a boardroom judge on his father's reality television series The Apprentice (2010\u20132015). He appeared in 23 episodes. In 2007, Eric Trump established the Eric Trump Foundation, a public charity which raised money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee.[24][25] On November 30, 2012, the foundation committed to raising $20 million over a ten-year period for the naming rights to the new Eric Trump Foundation Surgery & ICU Center in the Kay Research and Care Center, a $198 million tower that was officially opened on February 19, 2015, on the St. Jude campus.[26][27] St. Jude stated in 2013 that the 7th Annual Eric Trump Foundation Golf Invitational on September 9, 2013, at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff, New York, had \"...\u00a0raised 1.5 million for the kids of St. Jude\", for a total of $6 million since 2006.[28] On December 30, 2016, Richard C. Shadyac Jr., the president of the fundraising organization of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, wrote a letter to the Eric Trump Foundation stating that the foundation and \"...\u00a0related efforts, such as an Eric Trump Foundation-affiliated team that participates in the New York City Marathon\", had raised $16.3 million for the hospital since the charity's inception ten years earlier.[24] On December 21, 2016, Eric announced that he would stop active fundraising for the Eric Trump Foundation as of December 31. The move came to avoid the appearance that donors were using him to gain access to his father after he won the presidential election.[29] The 2016 tax return, filed under the foundation's alternative name the Curetivity Foundation, shows that the contributions it received increased from $1.8 million in 2015 to $3.2 million in 2016. The foundation gave $2,910,000 in donations to St. Jude and several smaller donations to other charities while paying a total of $145,000 to various for-profit properties owned by the Trump family.[30][31][32] In 2016, the fundraising president of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital stated that the Eric Trump Foundation had raised and donated $16.3 million to the hospital since the charity's foundation.[33] In June 2017, Forbes reported that the Eric Trump Foundation shifted money intended to go to cancer patients to the family's businesses.[34][35][36][37] Eric Trump had asserted that his foundation got to use Trump Organization assets for free (\"We get to use our assets 100% free of charge\"), but that appears not to be the case.[34] According to Forbes, more than $1.2 million of the donations went to the Trump Organization for the use of Trump's Westchester golf course and that \"Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament.\"[34] According to a former member of the foundation's board of directors, \"We did have to cover the expenses.\u00a0...The charity had grown so much that the Trump Organization couldn't absorb all of those costs anymore.\" Forbes acknowledged that the charity has done a great deal of good, including an intensive-care unit that opened in 2015 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, as well as funding cancer research.[34] Trump denies wrongdoing and pledges to cooperate with any review of the matter.[38] According to Trump, the Foundation's expense ratio is 12.6%, and \"at no time did the Trump Organization profit in any way from the foundation or any of its activities\".[39] Forbes also reported that more than $500,000 of the money donated for cancer patients \"was re-donated to other charities, many of which were connected to Trump family members or interests, including at least four groups that subsequently paid to hold golf tournaments at Trump courses.\"[34] According to Forbes, \"All of this seems to defy federal tax rules and state laws that ban self-dealing and misleading donors. It also raises larger questions about the Trump family dynamics and whether Eric and his brother, Don Jr., can be truly independent of their father.\"[34] The foundation says that relevant donors were informed that donations would be redirected.[40] The Eric Trump Foundation has advertised that its golf charity events raised money exclusively for St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, with 95\u2013100% of the money raised going toward the charity. Public tax records show that the foundation applied significant amounts of the funds raised to pay costs of the events to the Trump Organization for use of its facilities.[41] Additionally, the foundation donated to charitable causes other than St Jude and made grants to several other charities, including at least three animal welfare organizations and the American Society for Enology and Viticulture, a California wine industry organization.[41] Trump said in July 2016 that his father, Donald Trump, had made \"hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal donations\" to the Eric Trump Foundation in the past, although the Eric Trump Foundation's tax records don't explicitly show such donations. When The Washington Post followed up for evidence, Trump appeared to backtrack and refused to give details.[42] In June 2017, the New York State Attorney General's Office confirmed that it had begun an inquiry into the Eric Trump Foundation, based on issues raised by the Forbes investigation.[43][44] The investigation was reported as ongoing in December 2018.[45] His father's 2016 presidential campaign was formally launched on June 16, 2015 at Trump Tower in New York City. He was a key advisor, fundraiser, and campaign surrogate during his father's successful run for the presidency. Trump and his wife made campaign appearances in numerous states on behalf of his father.[46] On August 2, 2016, in a television appearance on CBS This Morning, Trump was asked to comment on his father's controversial statement to USA Today the previous day in which he said that if his daughter were ever subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace, he hoped she would find another company to work for or switch careers. Eric Trump said, \"Ivanka is a strong, powerful woman; she wouldn't allow herself to be objected [recte subjected] to it.\"[47] On January 20, 2017, he attended the inauguration of Donald Trump at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., as his father took office as the 45th president of the United States. In 2010, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticized Trump, a big game hunter, for an African hunting trip he took with Donald Trump Jr., his older brother. PETA condemned the pair after photos showed the brothers on an organized safari in Zimbabwe, where their hunting targets included elephants and leopards.[48] The director general of the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, V. Chandenga, issued an official response supporting the brothers and calling any allegations of illegality \"baseless\" and \"false\".[49] Both brothers defended their safari via Twitter, affirming their actions as hunters and longtime advocates of the outdoors.[50] Donald Trump also addressed the controversy, saying on TMZ that he fully supported his sons' actions.[50] On July 4, 2013, Trump became engaged to his longtime girlfriend Lara Lea Yunaska, an associate producer on the syndicated television news program Inside Edition. They married on November 8, 2014, at Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.[51][52][53] On September 12, 2017, the couple's first child, son Eric \"Luke\" Trump, was born.[54] On August 19, 2019, Lara gave birth to daughter Carolina Dorothy Trump, the couple's second child.[55]",

He is the third child and second son of President Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump.\nA fourth generation businessman (following his great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father), he is a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his older brother Donald Jr.[5] During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so.[6]\nHe also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice.\nEric Trump is under United States Attorney for the District of Columbia's investigation along with his sister Ivanka for their role in their father's inauguration.[7]\nEric Trump was born in New York City and attended Trinity School.[3] His parents divorced in 1992, when he was eight years old. As a young boy, Trump spent his summers in the Czech countryside near Zlin with his maternal grandparents. His grandfather, Milos Zelnicek, who died in 1990, was an engineer; his grandmother, Maria, was a worker in a shoe factory. His grandfather taught Trump how to hunt and fish.[8]\nIn 2002, he graduated from the Hill School and subsequently served on its board until 2013.[9][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] He graduated with a degree in finance and management, with honors, from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.[10][11]\nTrump started accompanying his father to job sites and negotiations from a very young age. Later in his youth he spent summers mowing lawns, laying tile, cutting rebar, hanging chandeliers, and performing various other work at his father's properties. Trump briefly considered other careers but decided to join the family business while he was a high school student.[11]\nTrump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions of the Trump Organization.[11] He worked with his sister, Ivanka, to redesign and renovate Trump National Doral and its Blue Monster course in Miami, Florida.[12]\nIn 2013, Trump received Wine Enthusiast Magazine's \"Rising Star of the Year\" Award.[13]\nAmid the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal\u2014where President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter\u2014Eric Trump strongly criticized Hunter, accusing him of nepotism. Eric claimed that, unlike Hunter, \"When my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals.\" However, when Donald Trump became president, rather than place his assets in a blind trust, he made Eric a top executive in the family business, which continues to operate and promote deals across the world.[14][15][16][17][18][19] PolitiFact and the Washington Post fact-checker rated Eric Trump's assertion that the Trump family \"got out of all international business\" as false.[20][21] PolitiFact noted that not only has the Trump family engaged in international business dealings since Trump became president, but that some of the Trump children, including Eric, have openly celebrated their international business activities during that time.[20]\nIn October 2019, Eric Trump complained about the Bidens, \"Why is it that every family goes into politics and enriches themselves?\" Shortly before he made that statement, President Trump had decided that the G-7 summit would be held at the Trump Doral resort, which was owned by the Trump family business. President Trump reversed his decision amid bipartisan condemnation from Republicans and Democrats.[22][23]\nHe was a boardroom judge on his father's reality television series The Apprentice (2010\u20132015). He appeared in 23 episodes.\nIn 2007, Eric Trump established the Eric Trump Foundation, a public charity which raised money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee.[24][25] On November 30, 2012, the foundation committed to raising $20 million over a ten-year period for the naming rights to the new Eric Trump Foundation Surgery &amp; ICU Center in the Kay Research and Care Center, a $198 million tower that was officially opened on February 19, 2015, on the St. Jude campus.[26][27]\nSt. Jude stated in 2013 that the 7th Annual Eric Trump Foundation Golf Invitational on September 9, 2013, at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff, New York, had \"...\u00a0raised 1.5 million for the kids of St. Jude\", for a total of $6 million since 2006.[28] On December 30, 2016, Richard C. Shadyac Jr., the president of the fundraising organization of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, wrote a letter to the Eric Trump Foundation stating that the foundation and \"...\u00a0related efforts, such as an Eric Trump Foundation-affiliated team that participates in the New York City Marathon\", had raised $16.3 million for the hospital since the charity's inception ten years earlier.[24]\nOn December 21, 2016, Eric announced that he would stop active fundraising for the Eric Trump Foundation as of December 31. The move came to avoid the appearance that donors were using him to gain access to his father after he won the presidential election.[29]\nThe 2016 tax return, filed under the foundation's alternative name the Curetivity Foundation, shows that the contributions it received increased from $1.8 million in 2015 to $3.2 million in 2016. The foundation gave $2,910,000 in donations to St. Jude and several smaller donations to other charities while paying a total of $145,000 to various for-profit properties owned by the Trump family.[30][31][32]\nIn 2016, the fundraising president of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital stated that the Eric Trump Foundation had raised and donated $16.3 million to the hospital since the charity's foundation.[33]\nIn June 2017, Forbes reported that the Eric Trump Foundation shifted money intended to go to cancer patients to the family's businesses.[34][35][36][37] Eric Trump had asserted that his foundation got to use Trump Organization assets for free (\"We get to use our assets 100% free of charge\"), but that appears not to be the case.[34] According to Forbes, more than $1.2 million of the donations went to the Trump Organization for the use of Trump's Westchester golf course and that \"Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament.\"[34] According to a former member of the foundation's board of directors, \"We did have to cover the expenses.\u00a0...The charity had grown so much that the Trump Organization couldn't absorb all of those costs anymore.\" Forbes acknowledged that the charity has done a great deal of good, including an intensive-care unit that opened in 2015 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, as well as funding cancer research.[34] Trump denies wrongdoing and pledges to cooperate with any review of the matter.[38]\nAccording to Trump, the Foundation's expense ratio is 12.6%, and \"at no time did the Trump Organization profit in any way from the foundation or any of its activities\".[39]\nForbes also reported that more than $500,000 of the money donated for cancer patients \"was re-donated to other charities, many of which were connected to Trump family members or interests, including at least four groups that subsequently paid to hold golf tournaments at Trump courses.\"[34] According to Forbes, \"All of this seems to defy federal tax rules and state laws that ban self-dealing and misleading donors. It also raises larger questions about the Trump family dynamics and whether Eric and his brother, Don Jr., can be truly independent of their father.\"[34] The foundation says that relevant donors were informed that donations would be redirected.[40]\nThe Eric Trump Foundation has advertised that its golf charity events raised money exclusively for St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, with 95\u2013100% of the money raised going toward the charity. Public tax records show that the foundation applied significant amounts of the funds raised to pay costs of the events to the Trump Organization for use of its facilities.[41] Additionally, the foundation donated to charitable causes other than St Jude and made grants to several other charities, including at least three animal welfare organizations and the American Society for Enology and Viticulture, a California wine industry organization.[41]\nTrump said in July 2016 that his father, Donald Trump, had made \"hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal donations\" to the Eric Trump Foundation in the past, although the Eric Trump Foundation's tax records don't explicitly show such donations. When The Washington Post followed up for evidence, Trump appeared to backtrack and refused to give details.[42]\nIn June 2017, the New York State Attorney General's Office confirmed that it had begun an inquiry into the Eric Trump Foundation, based on issues raised by the Forbes investigation.[43][44] The investigation was reported as ongoing in December 2018.[45]\nHis father's 2016 presidential campaign was formally launched on June 16, 2015 at Trump Tower in New York City. He was a key advisor, fundraiser, and campaign surrogate during his father's successful run for the presidency. Trump and his wife made campaign appearances in numerous states on behalf of his father.[46]\nOn August 2, 2016, in a television appearance on CBS This Morning, Trump was asked to comment on his father's controversial statement to USA Today the previous day in which he said that if his daughter were ever subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace, he hoped she would find another company to work for or switch careers. Eric Trump said, \"Ivanka is a strong, powerful woman; she wouldn't allow herself to be objected [recte subjected] to it.\"[47]\nOn January 20, 2017, he attended the inauguration of Donald Trump at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., as his father took office as the 45th president of the United States.\nIn 2010, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticized Trump, a big game hunter, for an African hunting trip he took with Donald Trump Jr., his older brother. PETA condemned the pair after photos showed the brothers on an organized safari in Zimbabwe, where their hunting targets included elephants and leopards.[48] The director general of the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, V. Chandenga, issued an official response supporting the brothers and calling any allegations of illegality \"baseless\" and \"false\".[49] Both brothers defended their safari via Twitter, affirming their actions as hunters and longtime advocates of the outdoors.[50] Donald Trump also addressed the controversy, saying on TMZ that he fully supported his sons' actions.[50]\nOn July 4, 2013, Trump became engaged to his longtime girlfriend Lara Lea Yunaska, an associate producer on the syndicated television news program Inside Edition. They married on November 8, 2014, at Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.[51][52][53] On September 12, 2017, the couple's first child, son Eric \"Luke\" Trump, was born.[54] On August 19, 2019, Lara gave birth to daughter Carolina Dorothy Trump, the couple's second child.[55]\n</body></html>"

Trump since 2017.[1] The daughter and second child of President Trump and his first wife, Ivana, she is the first Jewish member of a first family, having converted before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner.[3] She is a fourth-generation businessperson who followed in the footsteps of her great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father, serving for a time as an executive vice president of the family-owned Trump Organization. She was also a boardroom judge on her father's television show The Apprentice.[4][5][6] Starting in March 2017, she left the Trump Organization and began serving in her father's presidential administration as a senior adviser alongside her husband. She assumed this official, unpaid position after ethics concerns were raised about her having access to classified material while not being held to the same restrictions as a federal employee.[7][8][9] She was considered part of the president's inner circle even before becoming an official employee in his administration.[10] She is also one of the wealthiest of her family, with an estimated net worth of $300 million.[11] Trump[12] was born in Manhattan, New York City, and is the second child of Czech-American model Ivana (n\u00e9e\u00a0Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1) and Donald Trump, who in 2017 became the 45th president of the United States.[13] Her father has German[14] and Scottish ancestry[15] and her mother Czech ancestry.[16] For most of her life, she has been nicknamed \"Ivanka\", a Slavic diminutive form of Ivana.[17] Her parents divorced in 1992 when she was ten years old.[13][18] She has two brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, a half-sister, Tiffany, and a half-brother, Barron. She attended the Chapin School in Manhattan until she was 15, when she transferred to Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Connecticut. She characterized Choate's \"boarding-school life\" as being like a \"prison\", while her \"friends in New York were having fun\".[19] After graduating from Choate,[20] she attended Georgetown University for two years, then transferred to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, from which she graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2004.[21][22] Her father had also transferred to Wharton after two years at another institution, Fordham University.[23] Trump briefly worked for Forest City Enterprises as a real estate project manager.[24] In 2005, she joined the family business as Executive Vice President of Development & Acquisitions at the Trump Organization.[25] In 2007, she formed a partnership with Dynamic Diamond Corp., the company of diamond vendor Moshe Lax, to create Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, a line of diamond and gold jewelry sold at her first flagship retail store in Manhattan.[26][27] In November 2011, her retail flagship moved from Madison Avenue to 109 Mercer Street, a larger space in the fashionable SoHo district.[28][29] In December 2012, members of 100 Women in Hedge Funds elected Ivanka Trump to their board.[30] On October 2, 2015, it was reported that \"Ivanka Trump's flagship store on Mercer Street appear[s] to be closed\" and, noting that the shop had been \"stripped clean\".[31] In October 2016, the only dedicated retail shop and flagship boutique for Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry was located at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York City, with her brand also being available at Hudson's Bay and fine-jewelry stores throughout the U.S. and Canada, as well as in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.[32] She also had her own line of Ivanka Trump fashion items, including clothes, handbags, shoes, and accessories, available in major U.S. and Canadian department stores including Macy's and Hudson's Bay.[33] Her brand was criticized for allegedly copying designs by other designers,[34][35] and by PETA and other animal rights activists for using fur from rabbits.[36][37] In 2016, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled Ivanka Trump-branded scarves because they did not meet federal flammability standards.[38][39] A 2016 analysis found that most of the fashion line was produced outside the U.S.[40] Ivanka Trump-brand shoes have been supplied by Chengdu Kameido Shoes in Sichuan and Hangzhou HS Fashion (via G-III Apparel Group) in Zhejiang.[41] On February 2, 2017, after months of customers boycotting and poor sales,[42] department store chains Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom dropped Trump's fashion line, citing \"poor performance.\"[43] On February 9, 2017, presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway controversially encouraged Fox News viewers to purchase Trump's retail products.[44] In June 2017, three people with the organization called China Labor Watch were arrested by Chinese authorities while investigating Huajian International, which makes shoes for several American brands, including Ivanka Trump's brand. The Trump Administration called for their release.[45][46] On July 24, 2018, Trump announced that she shut down her company after deciding to pursue a career in public policy instead of returning to her fashion business.[47][48] When Trump was attending boarding school as a teenager, she got into modeling \"on weekends and holidays and absolutely not during the school year,\" according to her mother, Ivana Trump.[49] She was featured in print advertisements for Tommy Hilfiger and Sasson Jeans[50][51] and walked fashion runways for Versace, Marc Bouwer and Thierry Mugler.[49] In May 1997, she was featured on the cover of Seventeen which ran a story on \"celeb moms & daughters\".[52][49] Trump joined the Trump Organization in an executive position. Soon after that, she started her jewelry, shoe, and apparel lines, and appeared in advertisements promoting the Trump Organization and her products. She was also featured in women's and special interest publications in \"soft-hitting\" profiles focusing on \"looks, lifestyles, and product lines\" and was featured on the cover of some issues, such as Harper's Bazaar, Forbes Life, Golf Magazine, Town & Country, and Vogue.[53][54] She was featured on the cover of Stuff in August 2006 and again in September 2007.[55] In 2006, Trump filled in for Carolyn Kepcher on five episodes of her father's television program The Apprentice 5, first appearing to help judge the Gillette task in week 2.[56] Like Kepcher, Trump visited the site of the tasks and spoke to the teams.[55] Trump collaborated with season 5 winner Sean Yazbeck on his winner's project of choice, Trump SoHo Hotel-Condominium.[57][58][59] She replaced Kepcher as a primary boardroom judge during the sixth season of The Apprentice and its follow-up iteration, Celebrity Apprentice.[60] In 1997, at the age of 15, Trump co-hosted the Miss Teen USA Pageant, which was partially owned by her father, Donald Trump, from 1996 to 2005.[49] In 2006, she was a guest judge on Project Runway's third season and on season 4 of Project Runway All Stars.[61][62][63] In 2010, Trump and her husband briefly portrayed themselves in Season 4 Episode 6 of Gossip Girl.[64] In October 2009, Trump's first self-help book, The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life, was published; according to ghostwriter Daniel Paisner, he co-wrote the book.[65][66] On the back of the book\u2014as well as on the Trump Organization website until 2011 and in her Huffington Post author biography\u2014she claimed to have graduated summa cum laude from Wharton.[67][21][68][24] In May 2017, her second self-help book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, was published; she used the services of a writer, a researcher, and a fact-checker.[69][70][71] The book debuted in the number four spot in the \"Advice, How-To and Misc.\" category of the New York Times best seller list, received a great deal of negative criticism,[42] and was absent from the list two weeks later.[72][73] In 2015, she publicly endorsed her father's presidential campaign. She was involved with the campaign by making public appearances to support and defend him.[74][75][76] However, she admitted mixed feelings about his presidential ambitions, saying in October 2015, \"As a citizen, I love what he's doing. As a daughter, it's obviously more complicated.\"[77] In August 2015, Donald Trump stated that she was his leading advisor on \"women's health and women\" and said it was she who propelled him to elaborate on his views of women.[78][79] In January 2016, Trump was featured in a radio ad that aired in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, in which she praised her father.[80][81] She appeared by his side following the results of early voting states in 2016, in particular briefly speaking in South Carolina.[82][83] She was not able to vote in the New York primary in April 2016 because she had missed the October 2015 deadline to change her registration from independent to Republican.[84] Trump introduced her father in a speech immediately before his own speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention (RNC) in July.[85] The George Harrison song \"Here Comes the Sun\" was used as her entrance music. She stated, \"One of my father's greatest talents is the ability to see the potential in people\", and said he would \"Make America Great Again.\"[86] Her speech was well received as portraying Donald Trump \"in a warmer-than-usual light\", according to The Washington Post.[87] An earlier Post article had questioned whether the policy positions Ivanka Trump espoused were closer to those of Hillary Clinton than to those of her father.[88] After the speech, the George Harrison estate complained about the use of his song as being offensive to their wishes.[89] The next morning, Ivanka's official Twitter account tweeted, \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech\" with a link to a Macy's page that featured the dress she wore.[90] After her father's election, Trump wore a bracelet on a family appearance with the president-elect on 60 Minutes. Her company then used an email blast to promote the bracelet. After critiques for \"monetization\", the company quickly apologized, calling the publicity the work of \"a well-intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol.\" A spokeswoman said the company was, post-election, \"proactively discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going forward.\"[91][92] Trump has collected the work of artists who have protested to her directly following her father's election victory. In January 2017, artist Richard Prince returned a $36,000 payment he received for a work featuring Ivanka and disavowed its creation.[93] Other artists joined behind a movement created by the Halt Action Group called @dear_ivanka, which aimed to change Trump's policies by appealing to Ivanka.[94] Among its supporters were contemporary artist Alex Da Corte who told Trump to stay away from his paintings after she appeared in front of one on a social media post.[95][94] On Friday, January 20, 2017, she attended the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. Ivanka Trump partly negotiated rates of hotel rooms, rental spaces, and meals at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on which her father's inaugural committee spent funds, WNYC and ProPublica reported in December 2018.[96] She has been mentioned with regards to the links between Trump associates and Russian officials.[97][98] She, along with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is under investigation by the United States attorney for the District of Columbia for their role in their father's inauguration,[99] although \"none of them had any official role in running the committee\".[100] In January 2017, Trump resigned from her position at the Trump Organization.[101] The organization also removed images of Trump and her father from their websites, in accordance with official advice on federal ethics rules.[102] In the early months of her father's presidency, some commented that she was filling a quasi\u2013first lady role[103] while First Lady Melania Trump remained in New York City (her son Barron completed the school year in New York before the first lady moved to Washington);[103] Trump stated that she had no intention of being first lady.[104][105] After advising her father in an unofficial capacity for the first two months of his administration, Trump was appointed \"First Daughter and Senior Advisor to the President,\"[7][106] a government employee, on March 29, 2017;[107][108][n 1] She takes no salary.[7][107] Prior to becoming a federal employee, she used a personal email for government work.[112] Amid the contentious early months of her father's administration, some commentators compared her role in the administration to that of Julie Nixon Eisenhower, daughter of President Richard Nixon. Nixon Eisenhower was one of the Nixon administration's most vocal defenders, and Trump defended the Trump administration and her father personally against a myriad of allegations.[113][114] Washington Post opinion columnist Alyssa Rosenberg wrote, \"Both daughters served as important validators for their fathers.\"[113] In early April 2017, the government of China extended trademarks to Trump's businesses.[115] On the same day, Donald Trump hosted Chinese president Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago and Trump and Kushner sat next to the Chinese leader and his wife[116] Peng Liyuan[117] at the state dinner.[118][119] Also during the visit, Trump and Kushner's five-year-old daughter Arabella \"sang a traditional Chinese song, in Mandarin, [for Xi]. The video, which was lavishly praised by Chinese state media, played over 2.2 million times on China's popular news portal\", Tencent QQ.[116] In late April 2017, Trump hired Julie Radford as her chief of staff. Before the end of the month, Trump and Radford had plans to travel with Dina Powell and Hope Hicks to the first W20 women's summit. The W20 was organized by the National Council of German Women's Organizations and the Association of German Women Entrepreneurs[120][121] as one of the preparatory meetings leading up to the G20 head-of-state summit in July. At the conference, Trump spoke about women's rights. The US media reported that when she praised her father as an advocate for women, the audience hissed and booed in response. Although the audience can be clearly heard hissing in video footage of the event, German newspaper Bild claimed US reports were simply false; instead, they reported, she \"made a sophisticated and level-headed impression\".[122][123] [124] It was announced by Donald Trump in August 2017 that his daughter would lead the U.S. delegation to India in the fall in a global support of women's entrepreneurship. In response to the announcement, an Indian diplomat was quoted as stating, \"We regard Ivanka Trump the way we do half-wit Saudi princes. It's in our national interest to flatter them.\"[125] The majority of reactions to her actual performance alongside P.M. Modi at the event were substantial. Anu Acharya, founder of a medical diagnosis company, said \"What mattered to me is that she has been an entrepreneur, and she is an adviser to the president of the U.S.\" Shveta Raina, who runs Talerang, a startup that prepares Indian college graduates for the workplace, said Trump exceeded her expectations. \"She was poised and was able to answer questions that were seemingly off script. I think she is young and represents young women, so I think she was the right choice.\"[126] Still, the local media dubbed hers \"a royal visit.\"[42] Two days after Trump's announcement about his daughter's trip to India, the terror attack in Charlottesville occurred, and she and Jared flew off in to Trump Organization helicopter for a two-day getaway in Vermont.[42] Biographer and journalist Michael Wolff wrote a book released in January 2018 based on numerous interviews with members of Donald Trump's circle. In it, Wolff claims\u2014but cites no sources\u2014that Trump and her husband reached a deal that \"[i]f sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she'd be the one to run for president\".[127] She was criticized by some in March 2018 after the firing of Rex Tillerson for meeting with the South Korean foreign minister Kang, even though Kang primarily met with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and congressmen including Speaker Paul Ryan; Kang's lunch with Trump followed several meetings during the Olympics in South Korea.[128][129][130] In November 2018, The Washington Post reported that Trump shared her schedule with childcare providers\u2014a form of official government business\u2014through her personal email, a possible technical violation of federal records rules, which require communications to be sent within 20 days to a work account for permanent archival. A spokesman for Trump's ethics counsel stated that the improperly handled emails were sent before she was briefed on the rules: \"Trump sometimes used her personal account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family\", and that the emails did not have classified information. The spokesman also stated, \"no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\"[131][132] She and her father attended the 2019 G20 Osaka summit in late June 2019; the French government released a video of her awkwardly inserting herself into a conversation with world leaders, leading to online parodies and memes.[133][134] On 30 June 2019, Trump participated in talks between her father and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inside the Korean peninsula's demilitarized zone.[135][136] She described the experience as \"surreal.\"[135] Trump went in a worldwide tour in 2019 to promote her \"Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative\",[137][138] in which she traveled to Ethiopia[139] and Ivory Coast,[140] in sub-Saharan Africa, in April; and to Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay, in South America, in September;[141] and to Morocco, in northern Africa, in November.[142] Moreover, she even attended the 74th United Nations General Assembly to promote her initiative.[143] In 2007, Trump donated $1,000 to the presidential campaign of then-Senator Hillary Clinton.[144] In 2012, she endorsed Mitt Romney for president.[145] In 2013, Trump and her husband hosted a fundraiser for Democrat Cory Booker, and the couple bundled more than $40,000 for Booker's U.S. Senate campaign.[146] Trump advocates for women and Israel.[147] At the 2016 Republican National Convention, she said of her political views: \"Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat.\"[148] Trump was a member of the Donald J. Trump Foundation board[149] until the foundation was dissolved after then New York attorney general Barbara Underwood filed a civil lawsuit against the foundation, alleging \"persistently illegal conduct\" with respect to the foundation's money.[150][151][152] In November 2019, Trump's father was ordered to pay a $2 million settlement for misusing the foundation for his business and political purposes.[153] The settlements also included mandatory training requirements for Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[154] Trump also has ties to a number of Jewish charities, including Chai Lifeline, a charity which helps to look after children with cancer.[155] Other charities she supports include United Hatzalah, to which her father, Donald Trump, has reportedly made six-figure donations in the past.[156][157] After she was appointed advisor to the president, Trump donated the unpaid half of the advance payments for her book Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success to the National Urban League and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. She further said that any royalties exceeding the advances would also be given to charity.[69] Trump has a close relationship with her father, who has publicly expressed his admiration for her on several occasions, to the point that he has admitted that he would be dating her were she not his daughter.[158][159][160] Ivanka has likewise praised her father, complimenting his leadership skills and saying he empowers other people.[161] In an interview following her trip to the Olympics, she told NBC's Peter Alexander that it was \"inappropriate\" for Alexander to ask her about the sexual-abuse allegations against her father.[42] According to her mother, Ivanka speaks French and understands Czech.[162] Sarah Ellison, writing for Vanity Fair in 2018, indicated Ivanka Trump was the family member that \"everyone in the family seems to acknowledge\" is her father's \"favorite\" child.[163] This had been confirmed by the family members themselves in a 2015 interview with Barbara Walters on network television where the siblings were gathered and acknowledged this.[164] In January 2017 it was announced that she and Kushner had made arrangements to establish a family home in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C.[165] Federal filings implied that, in 2017, Trump and her husband may have assets upwards of $740 million.[166] They had previously shared an apartment on Park Avenue in New York City, which Trump chose due to its proximity to her work with the Trump Organization. The residence was featured in Elle Decor in 2012 with Kelly Behun as its interior decorator. The apartment included work by American artists John Baldessari and Rob Wynne.[167] In college, Trump was in a nearly four-year relationship with Greg Hersch, an investment banker at Salomon Brothers, Bear Stearns, and UBS.[168][169] From 2001 to 2005, she dated James \"Bingo\" Gubelmann.[19][20][168] In 2005, she started dating real estate developer Jared Kushner, whom she met through mutual friends.[170][171] The couple broke up in 2008 due to the objections of Kushner's parents[170] but got back together and married in a Jewish ceremony on October 25, 2009.[170][172] They have three children, a daughter born in July 2011[173] and two sons born in October 2013[174] and March 2016.[175] In an interview on The Dr. Oz Show, Trump revealed that she had suffered from postpartum depression after each of her pregnancies.[176] Raised a Presbyterian Christian,[177] Trump converted to Orthodox Judaism in July 2009,[178][179] after studying with Elie Weinstock from the Modern Orthodox Ramaz School.[180] Trump took the Hebrew name \"Yael.\"[181][182] She describes her conversion as an \"amazing and beautiful journey\" which her father supported \"from day one\", adding that he has \"tremendous respect\" for the Jewish faith.[147] She attests to keeping a kosher diet and observing the Jewish Sabbath, saying in 2015: \"We're pretty observant... It's been such a great life decision for me... I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity. From Friday to Saturday we don't do anything but hang out with one another. We don't make phone calls.\"[183] When living in New York City, she used to send her daughter to Jewish kindergarten. She said: \"It's such a blessing for me to have her come home every night and share with me the Hebrew that she's learned and sing songs for me around the holidays.\"[147] Trump and her husband made a pilgrimage to the grave of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, a popular prayer site, shortly before her father's election victory.[178][184] On May 22, 2017, the couple also traveled with Donald on the first official visit to Israel by the his administration, when he made the first visit to the Western Wall by a sitting U.S. president.[185] Ivanka also visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in western Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem during the trip.[186] She has been mentioned with regard to the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel.[187][188] In 2012, the Wharton Club of New York, the official alumni association of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania for the New York metropolitan area,[189] gave Trump the Joseph Wharton Award for Young Leadership, one of their four annual awards for alumni.[190] In 2016, she was presented with the Fashion Award for Excellence in Accessory Design.[clarification needed][191]",

Trump since 2017.[1] The daughter and second child of President Trump and his first wife, Ivana, she is the first Jewish member of a first family, having converted before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner.[3]\nShe is a fourth-generation businessperson who followed in the footsteps of her great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father, serving for a time as an executive vice president of the family-owned Trump Organization. She was also a boardroom judge on her father's television show The Apprentice.[4][5][6]\nStarting in March 2017, she left the Trump Organization and began serving in her father's presidential administration as a senior adviser alongside her husband. She assumed this official, unpaid position after ethics concerns were raised about her having access to classified material while not being held to the same restrictions as a federal employee.[7][8][9] She was considered part of the president's inner circle even before becoming an official employee in his administration.[10] She is also one of the wealthiest of her family, with an estimated net worth of $300 million.[11]\nTrump[12] was born in Manhattan, New York City, and is the second child of Czech-American model Ivana (n\u00e9e\u00a0Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1) and Donald Trump, who in 2017 became the 45th president of the United States.[13] Her father has German[14] and Scottish ancestry[15] and her mother Czech ancestry.[16] For most of her life, she has been nicknamed \"Ivanka\", a Slavic diminutive form of Ivana.[17] Her parents divorced in 1992 when she was ten years old.[13][18] She has two brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, a half-sister, Tiffany, and a half-brother, Barron.\nShe attended the Chapin School in Manhattan until she was 15, when she transferred to Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Connecticut. She characterized Choate's \"boarding-school life\" as being like a \"prison\", while her \"friends in New York were having fun\".[19]\nAfter graduating from Choate,[20] she attended Georgetown University for two years, then transferred to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, from which she graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2004.[21][22] Her father had also transferred to Wharton after two years at another institution, Fordham University.[23]\nTrump briefly worked for Forest City Enterprises as a real estate project manager.[24] In 2005, she joined the family business as Executive Vice President of Development &amp; Acquisitions at the Trump Organization.[25]\nIn 2007, she formed a partnership with Dynamic Diamond Corp., the company of diamond vendor Moshe Lax, to create Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, a line of diamond and gold jewelry sold at her first flagship retail store in Manhattan.[26][27] In November 2011, her retail flagship moved from Madison Avenue to 109 Mercer Street, a larger space in the fashionable SoHo district.[28][29]\nIn December 2012, members of 100 Women in Hedge Funds elected Ivanka Trump to their board.[30]\nOn October 2, 2015, it was reported that \"Ivanka Trump's flagship store on Mercer Street appear[s] to be closed\" and, noting that the shop had been \"stripped clean\".[31] In October 2016, the only dedicated retail shop and flagship boutique for Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry was located at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York City, with her brand also being available at Hudson's Bay and fine-jewelry stores throughout the U.S. and Canada, as well as in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.[32]\nShe also had her own line of Ivanka Trump fashion items, including clothes, handbags, shoes, and accessories, available in major U.S. and Canadian department stores including Macy's and Hudson's Bay.[33] Her brand was criticized for allegedly copying designs by other designers,[34][35] and by PETA and other animal rights activists for using fur from rabbits.[36][37] In 2016, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled Ivanka Trump-branded scarves because they did not meet federal flammability standards.[38][39] A 2016 analysis found that most of the fashion line was produced outside the U.S.[40] Ivanka Trump-brand shoes have been supplied by Chengdu Kameido Shoes in Sichuan and Hangzhou HS Fashion (via G-III Apparel Group) in Zhejiang.[41]\nOn February 2, 2017, after months of customers boycotting and poor sales,[42] department store chains Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom dropped Trump's fashion line, citing \"poor performance.\"[43]\nOn February 9, 2017, presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway controversially encouraged Fox News viewers to purchase Trump's retail products.[44] In June 2017, three people with the organization called China Labor Watch were arrested by Chinese authorities while investigating Huajian International, which makes shoes for several American brands, including Ivanka Trump's brand. The Trump Administration called for their release.[45][46]\nOn July 24, 2018, Trump announced that she shut down her company after deciding to pursue a career in public policy instead of returning to her fashion business.[47][48]\nWhen Trump was attending boarding school as a teenager, she got into modeling \"on weekends and holidays and absolutely not during the school year,\" according to her mother, Ivana Trump.[49] She was featured in print advertisements for Tommy Hilfiger and Sasson Jeans[50][51] and walked fashion runways for Versace, Marc Bouwer and Thierry Mugler.[49] In May 1997, she was featured on the cover of Seventeen which ran a story on \"celeb moms &amp; daughters\".[52][49]\nTrump joined the Trump Organization in an executive position. Soon after that, she started her jewelry, shoe, and apparel lines, and appeared in advertisements promoting the Trump Organization and her products. She was also featured in women's and special interest publications in \"soft-hitting\" profiles focusing on \"looks, lifestyles, and product lines\" and was featured on the cover of some issues, such as Harper's Bazaar, Forbes Life, Golf Magazine, Town &amp; Country, and Vogue.[53][54]\nShe was featured on the cover of Stuff in August 2006 and again in September 2007.[55]\nIn 2006, Trump filled in for Carolyn Kepcher on five episodes of her father's television program The Apprentice 5, first appearing to help judge the Gillette task in week 2.[56] Like Kepcher, Trump visited the site of the tasks and spoke to the teams.[55] Trump collaborated with season 5 winner Sean Yazbeck on his winner's project of choice, Trump SoHo Hotel-Condominium.[57][58][59]\nShe replaced Kepcher as a primary boardroom judge during the sixth season of The Apprentice and its follow-up iteration, Celebrity Apprentice.[60]\nIn 1997, at the age of 15, Trump co-hosted the Miss Teen USA Pageant, which was partially owned by her father, Donald Trump, from 1996 to 2005.[49]\nIn 2006, she was a guest judge on Project Runway's third season and on season 4 of Project Runway All Stars.[61][62][63]\nIn 2010, Trump and her husband briefly portrayed themselves in Season 4 Episode 6 of Gossip Girl.[64]\nIn October 2009, Trump's first self-help book, The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life, was published; according to ghostwriter Daniel Paisner, he co-wrote the book.[65][66] On the back of the book\u2014as well as on the Trump Organization website until 2011 and in her Huffington Post author biography\u2014she claimed to have graduated summa cum laude from Wharton.[67][21][68][24]\nIn May 2017, her second self-help book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, was published; she used the services of a writer, a researcher, and a fact-checker.[69][70][71] The book debuted in the number four spot in the \"Advice, How-To and Misc.\" category of the New York Times best seller list, received a great deal of negative criticism,[42] and was absent from the list two weeks later.[72][73]\nIn 2015, she publicly endorsed her father's presidential campaign. She was involved with the campaign by making public appearances to support and defend him.[74][75][76] However, she admitted mixed feelings about his presidential ambitions, saying in October 2015, \"As a citizen, I love what he's doing. As a daughter, it's obviously more complicated.\"[77] In August 2015, Donald Trump stated that she was his leading advisor on \"women's health and women\" and said it was she who propelled him to elaborate on his views of women.[78][79]\nIn January 2016, Trump was featured in a radio ad that aired in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, in which she praised her father.[80][81] She appeared by his side following the results of early voting states in 2016, in particular briefly speaking in South Carolina.[82][83] She was not able to vote in the New York primary in April 2016 because she had missed the October 2015 deadline to change her registration from independent to Republican.[84]\nTrump introduced her father in a speech immediately before his own speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention (RNC) in July.[85] The George Harrison song \"Here Comes the Sun\" was used as her entrance music. She stated, \"One of my father's greatest talents is the ability to see the potential in people\", and said he would \"Make America Great Again.\"[86] Her speech was well received as portraying Donald Trump \"in a warmer-than-usual light\", according to The Washington Post.[87] An earlier Post article had questioned whether the policy positions Ivanka Trump espoused were closer to those of Hillary Clinton than to those of her father.[88] After the speech, the George Harrison estate complained about the use of his song as being offensive to their wishes.[89] The next morning, Ivanka's official Twitter account tweeted, \"Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech\" with a link to a Macy's page that featured the dress she wore.[90]\nAfter her father's election, Trump wore a bracelet on a family appearance with the president-elect on 60 Minutes. Her company then used an email blast to promote the bracelet. After critiques for \"monetization\", the company quickly apologized, calling the publicity the work of \"a well-intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol.\" A spokeswoman said the company was, post-election, \"proactively discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going forward.\"[91][92]\nTrump has collected the work of artists who have protested to her directly following her father's election victory. In January 2017, artist Richard Prince returned a $36,000 payment he received for a work featuring Ivanka and disavowed its creation.[93] Other artists joined behind a movement created by the Halt Action Group called @dear_ivanka, which aimed to change Trump's policies by appealing to Ivanka.[94] Among its supporters were contemporary artist Alex Da Corte who told Trump to stay away from his paintings after she appeared in front of one on a social media post.[95][94]\nOn Friday, January 20, 2017, she attended the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. Ivanka Trump partly negotiated rates of hotel rooms, rental spaces, and meals at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on which her father's inaugural committee spent funds, WNYC and ProPublica reported in December 2018.[96] She has been mentioned with regards to the links between Trump associates and Russian officials.[97][98]\nShe, along with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is under investigation by the United States attorney for the District of Columbia for their role in their father's inauguration,[99] although \"none of them had any official role in running the committee\".[100]\nIn January 2017, Trump resigned from her position at the Trump Organization.[101] The organization also removed images of Trump and her father from their websites, in accordance with official advice on federal ethics rules.[102] In the early months of her father's presidency, some commented that she was filling a quasi\u2013first lady role[103] while First Lady Melania Trump remained in New York City (her son Barron completed the school year in New York before the first lady moved to Washington);[103] Trump stated that she had no intention of being first lady.[104][105]\nAfter advising her father in an unofficial capacity for the first two months of his administration, Trump was appointed \"First Daughter and Senior Advisor to the President,\"[7][106] a government employee, on March 29, 2017;[107][108][n 1] She takes no salary.[7][107] Prior to becoming a federal employee, she used a personal email for government work.[112]\nAmid the contentious early months of her father's administration, some commentators compared her role in the administration to that of Julie Nixon Eisenhower, daughter of President Richard Nixon. Nixon Eisenhower was one of the Nixon administration's most vocal defenders, and Trump defended the Trump administration and her father personally against a myriad of allegations.[113][114] Washington Post opinion columnist Alyssa Rosenberg wrote, \"Both daughters served as important validators for their fathers.\"[113]\nIn early April 2017, the government of China extended trademarks to Trump's businesses.[115] On the same day, Donald Trump hosted Chinese president Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago and Trump and Kushner sat next to the Chinese leader and his wife[116] Peng Liyuan[117] at the state dinner.[118][119] Also during the visit, Trump and Kushner's five-year-old daughter Arabella \"sang a traditional Chinese song, in Mandarin, [for Xi]. The video, which was lavishly praised by Chinese state media, played over 2.2 million times on China's popular news portal\", Tencent QQ.[116]\nIn late April 2017, Trump hired Julie Radford as her chief of staff. Before the end of the month, Trump and Radford had plans to travel with Dina Powell and Hope Hicks to the first W20 women's summit. The W20 was organized by the National Council of German Women's Organizations and the Association of German Women Entrepreneurs[120][121] as one of the preparatory meetings leading up to the G20 head-of-state summit in July. At the conference, Trump spoke about women's rights. The US media reported that when she praised her father as an advocate for women, the audience hissed and booed in response. Although the audience can be clearly heard hissing in video footage of the event, German newspaper Bild claimed US reports were simply false; instead, they reported, she \"made a sophisticated and level-headed impression\".[122][123]\n[124]\nIt was announced by Donald Trump in August 2017 that his daughter would lead the U.S. delegation to India in the fall in a global support of women's entrepreneurship. In response to the announcement, an Indian diplomat was quoted as stating, \"We regard Ivanka Trump the way we do half-wit Saudi princes. It's in our national interest to flatter them.\"[125] The majority of reactions to her actual performance alongside P.M. Modi at the event were substantial. Anu Acharya, founder of a medical diagnosis company, said \"What mattered to me is that she has been an entrepreneur, and she is an adviser to the president of the U.S.\" Shveta Raina, who runs Talerang, a startup that prepares Indian college graduates for the workplace, said Trump exceeded her expectations. \"She was poised and was able to answer questions that were seemingly off script. I think she is young and represents young women, so I think she was the right choice.\"[126] Still, the local media dubbed hers \"a royal visit.\"[42]\nTwo days after Trump's announcement about his daughter's trip to India, the terror attack in Charlottesville occurred, and she and Jared flew off in to Trump Organization helicopter for a two-day getaway in Vermont.[42]\nBiographer and journalist Michael Wolff wrote a book released in January 2018 based on numerous interviews with members of Donald Trump's circle. In it, Wolff claims\u2014but cites no sources\u2014that Trump and her husband reached a deal that \"[i]f sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she'd be the one to run for president\".[127]\nShe was criticized by some in March 2018 after the firing of Rex Tillerson for meeting with the South Korean foreign minister Kang, even though Kang primarily met with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and congressmen including Speaker Paul Ryan; Kang's lunch with Trump followed several meetings during the Olympics in South Korea.[128][129][130]\nIn November 2018, The Washington Post reported that Trump shared her schedule with childcare providers\u2014a form of official government business\u2014through her personal email, a possible technical violation of federal records rules, which require communications to be sent within 20 days to a work account for permanent archival. A spokesman for Trump's ethics counsel stated that the improperly handled emails were sent before she was briefed on the rules: \"Trump sometimes used her personal account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family\", and that the emails did not have classified information. The spokesman also stated, \"no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\"[131][132]\nShe and her father attended the 2019 G20 Osaka summit in late June 2019; the French government released a video of her awkwardly inserting herself into a conversation with world leaders, leading to online parodies and memes.[133][134]\nOn 30 June 2019, Trump participated in talks between her father and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inside the Korean peninsula's demilitarized zone.[135][136] She described the experience as \"surreal.\"[135]\nTrump went in a worldwide tour in 2019 to promote her \"Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative\",[137][138] in which she traveled to Ethiopia[139] and Ivory Coast,[140] in sub-Saharan Africa, in April; and to Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay, in South America, in September;[141] and to Morocco, in northern Africa, in November.[142] Moreover, she even attended the 74th United Nations General Assembly to promote her initiative.[143]\nIn 2007, Trump donated $1,000 to the presidential campaign of then-Senator Hillary Clinton.[144] In 2012, she endorsed Mitt Romney for president.[145] In 2013, Trump and her husband hosted a fundraiser for Democrat Cory Booker, and the couple bundled more than $40,000 for Booker's U.S. Senate campaign.[146] Trump advocates for women and Israel.[147] At the 2016 Republican National Convention, she said of her political views: \"Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat.\"[148]\nTrump was a member of the Donald J. Trump Foundation board[149] until the foundation was dissolved after then New York attorney general Barbara Underwood filed a civil lawsuit against the foundation, alleging \"persistently illegal conduct\" with respect to the foundation's money.[150][151][152] In November 2019, Trump's father was ordered to pay a $2 million settlement for misusing the foundation for his business and political purposes.[153] The settlements also included mandatory training requirements for Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.[154]\nTrump also has ties to a number of Jewish charities, including Chai Lifeline, a charity which helps to look after children with cancer.[155] Other charities she supports include United Hatzalah, to which her father, Donald Trump, has reportedly made six-figure donations in the past.[156][157]\nAfter she was appointed advisor to the president, Trump donated the unpaid half of the advance payments for her book Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success to the National Urban League and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. She further said that any royalties exceeding the advances would also be given to charity.[69]\nTrump has a close relationship with her father, who has publicly expressed his admiration for her on several occasions, to the point that he has admitted that he would be dating her were she not his daughter.[158][159][160] Ivanka has likewise praised her father, complimenting his leadership skills and saying he empowers other people.[161] In an interview following her trip to the Olympics, she told NBC's Peter Alexander that it was \"inappropriate\" for Alexander to ask her about the sexual-abuse allegations against her father.[42]\nAccording to her mother, Ivanka speaks French and understands Czech.[162] Sarah Ellison, writing for Vanity Fair in 2018, indicated Ivanka Trump was the family member that \"everyone in the family seems to acknowledge\" is her father's \"favorite\" child.[163] This had been confirmed by the family members themselves in a 2015 interview with Barbara Walters on network television where the siblings were gathered and acknowledged this.[164]\nIn January 2017 it was announced that she and Kushner had made arrangements to establish a family home in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C.[165] Federal filings implied that, in 2017, Trump and her husband may have assets upwards of $740 million.[166] They had previously shared an apartment on Park Avenue in New York City, which Trump chose due to its proximity to her work with the Trump Organization. The residence was featured in Elle Decor in 2012 with Kelly Behun as its interior decorator. The apartment included work by American artists John Baldessari and Rob Wynne.[167]\nIn college, Trump was in a nearly four-year relationship with Greg Hersch, an investment banker at Salomon Brothers, Bear Stearns, and UBS.[168][169] From 2001 to 2005, she dated James \"Bingo\" Gubelmann.[19][20][168]\nIn 2005, she started dating real estate developer Jared Kushner, whom she met through mutual friends.[170][171] The couple broke up in 2008 due to the objections of Kushner's parents[170] but got back together and married in a Jewish ceremony on October 25, 2009.[170][172] They have three children, a daughter born in July 2011[173] and two sons born in October 2013[174] and March 2016.[175] In an interview on The Dr. Oz Show, Trump revealed that she had suffered from postpartum depression after each of her pregnancies.[176]\nRaised a Presbyterian Christian,[177] Trump converted to Orthodox Judaism in July 2009,[178][179] after studying with Elie Weinstock from the Modern Orthodox Ramaz School.[180] Trump took the Hebrew name \"Yael.\"[181][182] She describes her conversion as an \"amazing and beautiful journey\" which her father supported \"from day one\", adding that he has \"tremendous respect\" for the Jewish faith.[147] She attests to keeping a kosher diet and observing the Jewish Sabbath, saying in 2015: \"We're pretty observant... It's been such a great life decision for me... I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity. From Friday to Saturday we don't do anything but hang out with one another. We don't make phone calls.\"[183] When living in New York City, she used to send her daughter to Jewish kindergarten. She said: \"It's such a blessing for me to have her come home every night and share with me the Hebrew that she's learned and sing songs for me around the holidays.\"[147]\nTrump and her husband made a pilgrimage to the grave of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, a popular prayer site, shortly before her father's election victory.[178][184] On May 22, 2017, the couple also traveled with Donald on the first official visit to Israel by the his administration, when he made the first visit to the Western Wall by a sitting U.S. president.[185] Ivanka also visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in western Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem during the trip.[186]\nShe has been mentioned with regard to the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel.[187][188]\nIn 2012, the Wharton Club of New York, the official alumni association of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania for the New York metropolitan area,[189] gave Trump the Joseph Wharton Award for Young Leadership, one of their four annual awards for alumni.[190]\nIn 2016, she was presented with the Fashion Award for Excellence in Accessory Design.[clarification needed][191]\n</body></html>"

They married in 1977 and divorced in 1991. They have three children together, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 was born on February 20, 1949 in the Moravian town of Zl\u00edn (formerly known as Gottwaldov), Czechoslovakia, the daughters of Milo\u0161 Zeln\u00ed\u010dek (1927\u20131990) and Marie Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 (n\u00e9e Francov\u00e1).[1][2][3][4] From the age of 13, her father nurtured and encouraged her skiing talent. In the early 1970s, she attended Charles University in Prague.[5] According to Trump, she was selected as an alternate on the Czechoslovak ski team during the 1972 Winter Olympics, her specialties being the downhill and slalom.[6][7] Czechoslovakia did not send a ski team to the 1972 Winter Olympics.[8] In 1989, Petr Pomezn\u00fd, Secretary General of the Czechoslovak Olympic Committee, said, \"Who is this Ivana woman, and why do people keep calling us about her? We have searched so many times and have consulted many, many people, and there is no such girl in our records.\"[9] In 1971, Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 married Austrian ski instructor Alfred Winklmayr to obtain Austrian citizenship to be able to leave Communist Czechoslovakia without defecting and being therefore unable to return to visit her parents.[10][11][12][13] She received her Austrian passport in March 1972[14] and, as Ivana Winklmayr, in 1973 obtained an absentee divorce from Alfred Winklmayr in Los Angeles, California, where he had moved to teach skiing.[10][11][14] After her then boyfriend George (Ji\u0159i) Staidl was killed in a car accident in 1973,[15] Ivana moved to Canada where she lived with George (Ji\u0159i) Syrovatka whom she had dated since 1967; he had defected to Canada in 1971 and owned a ski boutique in Montreal.[10][4][11][13] For the following two years, she lived in Montreal, improved her English by taking night courses at McGill University,[citation needed] and worked as a model.[4][13] Her modeling jobs included promoting the 1976 Summer Olympics that were being hosted in Montreal.[4][13] In this capacity Ivana was in New York City with a group of models in 1976 where she met Donald Trump.[13] Donald Trump and Ivana M. Winklmayr were married in 1977 in a lavish wedding officiated by Norman Vincent Peale.[16][17][18] Donald and Ivana Trump became leading figures in New York society during the 1980s. They worked on several large projects, including the renovation of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City, construction of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.[19][20] They had three children: Donald Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977), Ivanka Trump (born October 30, 1981), and Eric Trump (born January 6, 1984). Donald Jr. learned to speak fluent Czech (with help of his maternal grandfather), while daughter Ivanka has only basic understanding of her mother's native tongue and Eric was not exposed to the language because at the time of his birth his grandparents were already comfortable enough in using English.[21][22] Ivana has ten grandchildren.[23] Ivana took a major role in The Trump Organization. She became the Vice President of Interior Design for the company, leading the signature design of Trump Tower. Afterwards, her then-husband appointed her to head up the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino as president. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988.[24][25] In October 1990, Ivana Trump's 63-year-old father died suddenly from a heart attack. According to The Guardian, her father \u2013 Milo\u0161 Zeln\u00ed\u010dek \u2013 was an informer for Czechoslovakia's St\u00e1tn\u00ed bezpe\u010dnost (StB) intelligence service and relayed information from Ivana Trump, including a prediction that George H.W. Bush would win the 1988 presidential election.[26] Ivana stood side-by-side with her husband Donald at the funeral in Zl\u00edn.[27] Jaroslav Jansa, codename \"Jarda\" and secret collaborator to the StB also attended the funeral.[26] That Christmas, when the family was on vacation in Aspen, Colorado, Ivana Trump encountered Marla Maples[28] who would later become Donald's second wife.[29] The Trumps' divorce proceedings appeared on New York tabloid newspapers' covers for eleven days in a row, and Liz Smith wrote about nothing else for three months.[30] In a deposition relating to their divorce, she accused Donald J. Trump of rape and of pulling out handfuls of her hair.[31] In Harry Hurt III's book Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, Ivana Trump confirmed that she had \"felt violated\". However, in a statement provided by Donald J. Trump and his lawyers, Ivana Trump stated that she did use the word \"rape\", but that she did not \"want [her] words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\"[32] Their divorce was granted in 1990 on the grounds of \"[c]ruel and inhuman treatment by Mr. Trump\".[33] A condition of settlement was that she wouldn't talk about their marriage without his permission.[32] In 1995, she married Riccardo Mazzucchelli.[34] She filed a $15 million breach of contract suit against Mazzucchelli for violating the confidentiality clause in their prenuptial agreement.[35] In 1997, Mazzucchelli sued Ivana and Donald for libel.[36] In the summer of 1997, she began dating Roffredo Gaetani, which continued until his death in 2005.[37] In April 2008, Ivana, then 59, married Rossano Rubicondi, then 36.[38] The $3 million wedding for 400 guests was hosted by ex-husband Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Daughter Ivanka Trump was her maid of honor.[39] On December 1, 2008, Ivana confirmed to the Associated Press that she had filed a legal separation agreement three months previously; she has stated in interviews that she and her husband have an on-again/off-again relationship. In December 2009, she said she had filed for divorce from Rubicondi;[40] the couple has continued to be seen together as recently as May 5, 2018.[41] Soon after her divorce from Donald Trump in 1992, she developed lines of clothing, fashion jewelry and beauty products that have been sold through television shopping channels. In 2005, Trump was involved in several proposed condominium projects that ultimately failed, including the never-built Ivana Las Vegas[42][43] In 2010, she sued the Finnish fashion company, Ivana Helsinki, accusing it of selling women's clothing that incorporates her name without permission.[44] She has written several novels, including, For Love Alone (1992), Free to Love (1993) and a self-help book called, The Best is Yet to Come: Coping with Divorce and Enjoying Life Again (1995). In June 1995, she began writing an advice column for Globe, titled Ask Ivana, about love and life.[45] In 1998, she bought 33% of Croatia's second-largest daily newspaper \u2013 with a circulation of 100,000 \u2013 she used to travel with her parents from the Czech Republic to Croatia on vacation.[46][47] In February 1999, she launched her own lifestyle magazine titled Ivana's Living in Style.[48] In 2001, she contributed an advice column for \"Divorce Magazine\".[49] In January 2010, Trump ended her advice column in Globe to pursue other business interests.[50] In 2017, she released an autobiography, Raising Trump, that covers her own upbringing and the early years of raising her children with Donald Trump.[51] She played a cameo role in the Hollywood film The First Wives Club (1996) with the line: \"Ladies, you have to be strong and independent. And remember: don't get mad, get everything.\"[52] She was the host of Oxygen Network's reality-dating program Ivana Young Man, which aired in 2006.[53] In 2008, she was a boardroom advisor on The Apprentice.[citation needed] In 2010, Trump took part in the UK version of Celebrity Big Brother, finishing seventh.[54]",

They married in 1977 and divorced in 1991. They have three children together, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump.\nIvana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 was born on February 20, 1949 in the Moravian town of Zl\u00edn (formerly known as Gottwaldov), Czechoslovakia, the daughters of Milo\u0161 Zeln\u00ed\u010dek (1927\u20131990) and Marie Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 (n\u00e9e Francov\u00e1).[1][2][3][4] From the age of 13, her father nurtured and encouraged her skiing talent. In the early 1970s, she attended Charles University in Prague.[5]\nAccording to Trump, she was selected as an alternate on the Czechoslovak ski team during the 1972 Winter Olympics, her specialties being the downhill and slalom.[6][7] Czechoslovakia did not send a ski team to the 1972 Winter Olympics.[8] In 1989, Petr Pomezn\u00fd, Secretary General of the Czechoslovak Olympic Committee, said, \"Who is this Ivana woman, and why do people keep calling us about her? We have searched so many times and have consulted many, many people, and there is no such girl in our records.\"[9]\nIn 1971, Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 married Austrian ski instructor Alfred Winklmayr to obtain Austrian citizenship to be able to leave Communist Czechoslovakia without defecting and being therefore unable to return to visit her parents.[10][11][12][13] She received her Austrian passport in March 1972[14] and, as Ivana Winklmayr, in 1973 obtained an absentee divorce from Alfred Winklmayr in Los Angeles, California, where he had moved to teach skiing.[10][11][14] After her then boyfriend George (Ji\u0159i) Staidl was killed in a car accident in 1973,[15] Ivana moved to Canada where she lived with George (Ji\u0159i) Syrovatka whom she had dated since 1967; he had defected to Canada in 1971 and owned a ski boutique in Montreal.[10][4][11][13] For the following two years, she lived in Montreal, improved her English by taking night courses at McGill University,[citation needed] and worked as a model.[4][13] Her modeling jobs included promoting the 1976 Summer Olympics that were being hosted in Montreal.[4][13]\nIn this capacity Ivana was in New York City with a group of models in 1976 where she met Donald Trump.[13] Donald Trump and Ivana M. Winklmayr were married in 1977 in a lavish wedding officiated by Norman Vincent Peale.[16][17][18] Donald and Ivana Trump became leading figures in New York society during the 1980s. They worked on several large projects, including the renovation of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City, construction of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.[19][20]\nThey had three children: Donald Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977), Ivanka Trump (born October 30, 1981), and Eric Trump (born January 6, 1984). Donald Jr. learned to speak fluent Czech (with help of his maternal grandfather), while daughter Ivanka has only basic understanding of her mother's native tongue and Eric was not exposed to the language because at the time of his birth his grandparents were already comfortable enough in using English.[21][22] Ivana has ten grandchildren.[23]\nIvana took a major role in The Trump Organization. She became the Vice President of Interior Design for the company, leading the signature design of Trump Tower. Afterwards, her then-husband appointed her to head up the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino as president. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988.[24][25]\nIn October 1990, Ivana Trump's 63-year-old father died suddenly from a heart attack. According to The Guardian, her father \u2013 Milo\u0161 Zeln\u00ed\u010dek \u2013 was an informer for Czechoslovakia's St\u00e1tn\u00ed bezpe\u010dnost (StB) intelligence service and relayed information from Ivana Trump, including a prediction that George H.W. Bush would win the 1988 presidential election.[26] Ivana stood side-by-side with her husband Donald at the funeral in Zl\u00edn.[27] Jaroslav Jansa, codename \"Jarda\" and secret collaborator to the StB also attended the funeral.[26] That Christmas, when the family was on vacation in Aspen, Colorado, Ivana Trump encountered Marla Maples[28] who would later become Donald's second wife.[29]\nThe Trumps' divorce proceedings appeared on New York tabloid newspapers' covers for eleven days in a row, and Liz Smith wrote about nothing else for three months.[30] In a deposition relating to their divorce, she accused Donald J. Trump of rape and of pulling out handfuls of her hair.[31] In Harry Hurt III's book Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump, Ivana Trump confirmed that she had \"felt violated\". However, in a statement provided by Donald J. Trump and his lawyers, Ivana Trump stated that she did use the word \"rape\", but that she did not \"want [her] words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\"[32] Their divorce was granted in 1990 on the grounds of \"[c]ruel and inhuman treatment by Mr. Trump\".[33] A condition of settlement was that she wouldn't talk about their marriage without his permission.[32]\nIn 1995, she married Riccardo Mazzucchelli.[34] She filed a $15 million breach of contract suit against Mazzucchelli for violating the confidentiality clause in their prenuptial agreement.[35] In 1997, Mazzucchelli sued Ivana and Donald for libel.[36]\nIn the summer of 1997, she began dating Roffredo Gaetani, which continued until his death in 2005.[37]\nIn April 2008, Ivana, then 59, married Rossano Rubicondi, then 36.[38] The $3 million wedding for 400 guests was hosted by ex-husband Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Daughter Ivanka Trump was her maid of honor.[39] On December 1, 2008, Ivana confirmed to the Associated Press that she had filed a legal separation agreement three months previously; she has stated in interviews that she and her husband have an on-again/off-again relationship. In December 2009, she said she had filed for divorce from Rubicondi;[40] the couple has continued to be seen together as recently as May 5, 2018.[41]\nSoon after her divorce from Donald Trump in 1992, she developed lines of clothing, fashion jewelry and beauty products that have been sold through television shopping channels.\nIn 2005, Trump was involved in several proposed condominium projects that ultimately failed, including the never-built Ivana Las Vegas[42][43]\nIn 2010, she sued the Finnish fashion company, Ivana Helsinki, accusing it of selling women's clothing that incorporates her name without permission.[44]\nShe has written several novels, including, For Love Alone (1992), Free to Love (1993) and a self-help book called, The Best is Yet to Come: Coping with Divorce and Enjoying Life Again (1995).\nIn June 1995, she began writing an advice column for Globe, titled Ask Ivana, about love and life.[45] In 1998, she bought 33% of Croatia's second-largest daily newspaper \u2013 with a circulation of 100,000 \u2013 she used to travel with her parents from the Czech Republic to Croatia on vacation.[46][47] In February 1999, she launched her own lifestyle magazine titled Ivana's Living in Style.[48] In 2001, she contributed an advice column for \"Divorce Magazine\".[49] In January 2010, Trump ended her advice column in Globe to pursue other business interests.[50]\nIn 2017, she released an autobiography, Raising Trump, that covers her own upbringing and the early years of raising her children with Donald Trump.[51]\nShe played a cameo role in the Hollywood film The First Wives Club (1996) with the line: \"Ladies, you have to be strong and independent. And remember: don't get mad, get everything.\"[52]\nShe was the host of Oxygen Network's reality-dating program Ivana Young Man, which aired in 2006.[53]\nIn 2008, she was a boardroom advisor on The Apprentice.[citation needed]\nIn 2010, Trump took part in the UK version of Celebrity Big Brother, finishing seventh.[54]\n</body></html>"

She is the second first lady (after Louisa Adams) born outside the United States,[7] the first one to be a naturalized citizen[8] and the first whose native language is not English.[9] Melanija Knavs was born in Novo Mesto, Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia), on April 26, 1970.[10][11] Her father, Viktor Knavs (born March 24, 1944), was from the nearby town of Rade\u010de and managed car and motorcycle dealerships for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer.[12][13] Her mother Amalija (n\u00e9e Ul\u010dnik) (born July 9, 1945) came from the village of Raka and worked as a patternmaker at the children's clothing manufacturer Jutranjka in Sevnica.[14][15] As a child, Melania and other children of workers at the factory participated in fashion shows that featured children's clothing.[16] She has an older sister, Ines, who is an artist and her \"longtime confidant\",[17][18][19] and an older half-brother\u2014whom she reportedly has never met\u2014from her father's previous relationship.[20][21] Knavs grew up in a modest apartment in a housing block in Sevnica, in the Lower Sava Valley.[2][22] Her father was in the League of Communists of Slovenia, which espoused a policy of state atheism.[23] As was common, however, he had his daughters secretly baptized as Catholics. When the Trumps met Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2017, Melania brought her rosary and asked the Pope to bless it.[24][25] When Knavs was a teenager, she moved with her family to a two-story house in Sevnica.[26] As a high-school student, she lived in a high-rise apartment in Ljubljana. She attended the Secondary School of Design and Photography in Ljubljana[27] and studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana for one year before she dropped out.[28][29][30] She began modeling at five years old and started doing commercial work at sixteen when she posed for the Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko.[31][32] When she began working as a model, she adapted the Slovene version of her last name \"Knavs\" to the German version \"Knauss\".[33] At eighteen, she signed with a modeling agency in Milan, Italy.[34] In 1992, she was named runner-up in the Jana Magazine \"Look of the Year\" contest, held in Ljubljana, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract.[10][35] After attending the University of Ljubljana for one year,[36] she modeled for fashion houses in Paris and Milan, where in 1995 she met Metropolitan Models co-owner Paolo Zampolli, a friend of her future husband Donald Trump, who was on a scouting trip in Europe. Zampolli urged her to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her.[16] In 1996, Knauss moved to Manhattan.[16][35][34][37] Zampolli arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian in Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square.[16] Knauss was featured in a sexually explicit photoshoot for the January 1996 issue of Max, a now-defunct French men's magazine, with another female model.[38] She also posed nude for the January 2000 edition of GQ magazine, appearing on the cover naked but for diamond jewelry, reclining on fur, aboard Trump's custom-fitted Boeing 727.[39] Asked about the photos in 2016, Donald Trump said: \"Melania was one of the most successful models, and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines. [The Max photo] was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.\"[40][41] In 2010, she launched her own line of jewelry, Melania Timepieces, and Jewelry, for sale on QVC. She also marketed a Melania Skin Care Collection, sold in high-end department stores.[42] According to a financial filing in 2016, her businesses brought in between $15,000 and $50,000 in royalties that year.[43] In 2017, the two companies that manufactured her jewelry and skincare products under license said they had terminated their relationship with her.[44] On inauguration day her companies and products were listed in her official White House biography, but they were quickly removed.[45] A White House spokesperson said her companies are no longer active and \"the First Lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so.\"[44] She speaks five languages: her native Slovenian, Serbian, English, French, and German.[46] Knauss came to the United States from Slovenia in 1996. She resided in the U.S. briefly on a visitor's visa and then obtained H-1B work visas. In 2000 she petitioned for a right to permanent residency under the EB-1 program, a program designed for people with \"extraordinary abilities.\" According to information from the Migration Policy Institute, only 2 percent of people in their field would be expected to qualify. The Washington Post reports that at that time Knauss's credentials included \"runway shows in Europe, a Camel cigarette billboard ad in Times Square and \u2014 in her biggest job at the time \u2014 a spot in the swimsuit edition of Sports Illustrated, which featured her on the beach in a string bikini, hugging a six-foot inflatable whale.\"[47] During the months that Melania campaigned with her husband prior to his successful bid for presidency, she defended his hard-line on immigration practices and laws by stating that her own path and achievement of citizenship had been legal, unlike those of the individuals Trump was campaigning against. However, investigative reporting done by the Associated Press revealed that she had been paid for 10 modeling jobs she had done before she had obtained her H-1B (work visa) and was still living in the U.S using her visitor visa. The Associated Press commented that \"Foreigners are not allowed to use a visitor visa to work for pay in the U.S. for American companies. Doing so would violate the terms of that visa and could prohibit a foreigner from later changing his or her immigration status in the U.S. or bar the foreigner from the United States again without special permission to come back.\"[6] Melania Trump obtained her citizenship in 2006. According to media reports she sponsored her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who went through the immigration process using \"chain migration\", a route that the president has repeatedly criticized.[48][49] In September 1998, Knauss met real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party and the couple began dating[50] while Trump was in the process of divorcing his second wife, Marla Maples. The divorce was finalized in 1999.[51][52] Knauss continued her modeling career[16] with her American magazine cover shoots, including In Style Weddings,[53] New York magazine, Avenue,[54] Philadelphia Style,[55] Vanity Fair,[56] and Vogue.[57] In 1999, the couple gained attention after a lewd interview with Shock jock Howard Stern on his show.[13][58] Knauss appeared with Trump while he campaigned for the 2000 Reform Party presidential nomination. When she was asked by The New York Times what her role would be if Donald Trump were to become president, she replied: \"I would be very traditional, like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy.\"[59] Knauss and Donald Trump became engaged in 2004. On January 22, 2005, they married in an Anglican service at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception in the ballroom at her husband's Mar-a-Lago estate.[60][61] The marriage was her first and his third. The event was attended by celebrities such as Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Rudy Giuliani, Heidi Klum, Star Jones, P. Diddy, Shaquille O'Neal, Barbara Walters, Conrad Black, Regis Philbin, Simon Cowell, Kelly Ripa, then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and former president Bill Clinton.[61][62] At the reception, Billy Joel serenaded the crowd with \"Just the Way You Are\" and supplied new lyrics to the tune of \"The Lady Is a Tramp\".[61] The Trumps' wedding ceremony and reception were widely covered by the media.[37] She wore a $200,000 dress made by John Galliano of the house of Christian Dior.[61] On March 20, 2006, she gave birth to their son, Barron William Trump.[63] She chose his middle name, while her husband chose his first name.[64] In November 2015, she was asked about her husband's presidential campaign and replied: \"I encouraged him because I know what he will do and what he can do for America. He loves the American people and he wants to help them.\"[65] She played a relatively small role in her husband's campaign, which is atypical of spouses of presidential candidates.[66][67][68] In 2016, she told CNN her focus as first lady would be to help women and children. She also said she would combat cyberbullying, especially among children.[69] In July 2016, her official website was redirected to trump.com. On Twitter, she stated that her site was outdated and did not \"accurately reflect [her] current business and professional interests\".[70] On July 18, 2016, she gave a speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. The speech contained a paragraph that was nearly identical to a paragraph of Michelle Obama's speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.[71][72][73] When asked about the speech, Melania said she wrote the speech herself \"with as little help as possible.\"[74] Two days later, Trump staff writer Meredith McIver took responsibility and apologized for the \"confusion\".[75] In February 2017, she sued Daily Mail and General Trust, the owner of British tabloid, the Daily Mail, seeking $150 million in damages over an August 2016 article that falsely alleged that she had worked for an escort service during her modeling days. The Mail retracted the article, apologized, and printed the retraction from the blogger they were quoting, who said: \"I had no legitimate factual basis to make these false statements and I fully retract them\".[76] The lawsuit stated the article had ruined her \"unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to establish \"multimillion dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which Plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world\".[77] Her claim raised potential ethical questions with its implication that she intended to profit from being first lady.[78] On February 18, 2017, the lawsuit was amended, removing the language about her earning potential and focusing instead on emotional distress.[79] In April 2017, the parties settled the lawsuit and the Daily Mail issued a statement that said, \"We accept that these allegations about Mrs. Trump are not true and we retract and withdraw them.\" The Mail agreed to pay her $2.9 million.[80][81] Five days before the election, she told a crowd of supporters in Pennsylvania: \"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers. It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied, or attacked. It is terrible when that happens on the playground. And it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the Internet.\"[82] Regarding the contrast of her platform with her husband's use of Twitter during his campaign, Melania said shortly after the election that she had rebuked him \"all the time\" but that \"he will do what he wants to do in the end\".[83] She assumed the role of first lady of the United States on January 20, 2017.[84][85] She continued living in Manhattan at the Trump Tower with their son, Barron, until the end of his 2016\u20132017 school year at Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School.[86][87] They moved into the White House in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2017.[88] Her Secret Service code name is \"Muse\" (beginning with the same letter as Trump's code name, \"Mogul\", per Secret Service tradition).[89] Her staff of 13 (as of January 2018) is smaller than that of the two previous first ladies after one year of their husbands' administration.[90] She is the second foreign-born woman to hold the title of first lady, after Louisa Adams, wife of John Quincy Adams, who was born in 1775 in London to a father from Maryland and an English mother.[91][92] She is also the first naturalized citizen (rather than birthright citizen) to hold the title, and the first whose native language is not English.[93] On March 8, 2017, she hosted her first White House event, a luncheon for International Women's Day. She spoke to an audience of women about her life as a female immigrant, and about working towards gender equality both domestically and abroad, noting the role of education as a tool against gender inequality.[94][95][96] In January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that during a three-month period where she lived in New York in 2017, she took Air Force jet flights between New York City, Florida and Washington at a cost of more than $675,000 to taxpayers.[97][98] In comparison, former first lady Michelle Obama's solo travel cost an average of about $350,000 a year.[97][98] On March 13, 2018, Trump scheduled a March 20 meeting with policy executives from technology companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snap, and Twitter, to address online harassment and Internet safety, with a particular focus on how those issues affect children.[99] Trump's office has avoided the use of the term \"cyberbullying,\"[99] and Trump has come under criticism for championing Internet civility while her husband's Internet behavior has been noted as uncivil.[99][100] Trump attended the roundtable event, focusing on how children are affected by modern technology. Trump said: \"I am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\" but \"that will not stop me from doing what I know is right.\"[101] Melania took an active role in planning the Trump administration's first state dinner on April 23, 2018, to honor French president Emmanuel Macron.[102] With Brigitte Macron, the French president's wife, Trump visited a Paul C\u00e9zanne exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington the day before.[103][104][105] In October 2018, Trump took a four-country, solo tour of Africa, without her husband, focusing on conservation and children and families, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt.[106] On November 13, 2018, Trump issued an \"extraordinary\" public statement calling for the firing of Deputy National Security Advisor Mira Ricardel. She had reportedly been privately pushing for Ricardel's ouster for weeks. The next day it was announced that Ricardel would \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"[107] It was described as unusual for a first lady to be publicly involved in White House personnel decisions.[108] During the El Paso shooting in Texas on August 3, 2019, a lone gunman killed 22 people and injured 24 others. Melania and President Trump visited the hospital where eight of the survivors were being cared for. The president and first lady met with the families of survivors, hospital staff and first responders, and posed with a baby who had been orphaned when both of his parents were killed. The White House had asked that the child be brought in and he was accompanied by his uncle.[109][110] During the 2020 State of the Union Address, President Trump awarded Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Free, who was sitting right beside Melania in the gallery, in which she presented the medal to him.[111][112] On May 7, 2018, Trump formally started the Be Best public awareness campaign, which focused on well-being for youth and advocated against cyberbullying and drug use.[113] The campaign was accompanied by a booklet that was promoted as having been written \"By First Lady Melania Trump and the Federal Trade Commission [FTC]\", but it was nearly identical to a document prepared in 2014 by the FTC.[114] The similarities prompted accusations of plagiarism, to which her office responded by admonishing the press for reporting on the issue.[115] The fact-checking site Snopes found the charge of plagiarism \"Mostly False\" saying, \"Melania Trump did not claim she had written the pamphlet herself, and she contributed an introduction to a slightly revised version of the booklet. The FTC was always credited for the creation of the booklet and supported its inclusion in the first lady's 'Be Best' campaign.\"[116] On June 17, 2018, Melania was referring to the Trump administration's \"Zero Tolerance\" immigration policy under which children were separated from their parents when she stated that she \"hates to see children separated from their families\" and wants there to be \"successful immigration reform.\"[117] On June 21, she made a hastily planned trip to Texas to get a firsthand look at the crisis affecting immigrant families at the U.S. border. She attended a roundtable with doctors, medical staff, social workers and other experts at Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter.[118] Trump became a fashion icon almost immediately after her husband's inauguration on January 20, 2017, with various media outlets reporting on her fashion choices. Vogue has compared Trump's wardrobe as first lady to that of Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan, noting that she closely works with designer Herv\u00e9 Pierre and prefers \"strongly tailored pieces\" in bold colors and almost exclusively wears high-end designers.[119][120] When the president and first lady visited Vatican City in May 2017, she identified as Catholic. She is the first Catholic to live in the White House since President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline and is the second Catholic first lady of the United States.[121][122] When she visited the Vatican, Pope Francis blessed her rosary beads, and she placed flowers at the feet of a statue of Mary at the Vatican's children's hospital.[123] Her husband describes himself as Presbyterian, and Melania and Donald Trump were married at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[124][125][126] Their son Barron was baptized there as well.[127] On May 14, 2018, she underwent an embolization, which is a minimally invasive procedure that deliberately blocks a blood vessel[128] in order to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful and there were no reported complications.[129]",

She is the second first lady (after Louisa Adams) born outside the United States,[7] the first one to be a naturalized citizen[8] and the first whose native language is not English.[9]\nMelanija Knavs was born in Novo Mesto, Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia), on April 26, 1970.[10][11] Her father, Viktor Knavs (born March 24, 1944), was from the nearby town of Rade\u010de and managed car and motorcycle dealerships for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer.[12][13] Her mother Amalija (n\u00e9e Ul\u010dnik) (born July 9, 1945) came from the village of Raka and worked as a patternmaker at the children's clothing manufacturer Jutranjka in Sevnica.[14][15] As a child, Melania and other children of workers at the factory participated in fashion shows that featured children's clothing.[16] She has an older sister, Ines, who is an artist and her \"longtime confidant\",[17][18][19] and an older half-brother\u2014whom she reportedly has never met\u2014from her father's previous relationship.[20][21]\nKnavs grew up in a modest apartment in a housing block in Sevnica, in the Lower Sava Valley.[2][22] Her father was in the League of Communists of Slovenia, which espoused a policy of state atheism.[23] As was common, however, he had his daughters secretly baptized as Catholics. When the Trumps met Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2017, Melania brought her rosary and asked the Pope to bless it.[24][25]\nWhen Knavs was a teenager, she moved with her family to a two-story house in Sevnica.[26] As a high-school student, she lived in a high-rise apartment in Ljubljana. She attended the Secondary School of Design and Photography in Ljubljana[27] and studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana for one year before she dropped out.[28][29][30]\nShe began modeling at five years old and started doing commercial work at sixteen when she posed for the Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko.[31][32] When she began working as a model, she adapted the Slovene version of her last name \"Knavs\" to the German version \"Knauss\".[33]\nAt eighteen, she signed with a modeling agency in Milan, Italy.[34] In 1992, she was named runner-up in the Jana Magazine \"Look of the Year\" contest, held in Ljubljana, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract.[10][35]\nAfter attending the University of Ljubljana for one year,[36] she modeled for fashion houses in Paris and Milan, where in 1995 she met Metropolitan Models co-owner Paolo Zampolli, a friend of her future husband Donald Trump, who was on a scouting trip in Europe. Zampolli urged her to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her.[16]\nIn 1996, Knauss moved to Manhattan.[16][35][34][37] Zampolli arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian in Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square.[16]\nKnauss was featured in a sexually explicit photoshoot for the January 1996 issue of Max, a now-defunct French men's magazine, with another female model.[38] She also posed nude for the January 2000 edition of GQ magazine, appearing on the cover naked but for diamond jewelry, reclining on fur, aboard Trump's custom-fitted Boeing 727.[39] Asked about the photos in 2016, Donald Trump said: \"Melania was one of the most successful models, and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines. [The Max photo] was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.\"[40][41]\nIn 2010, she launched her own line of jewelry, Melania Timepieces, and Jewelry, for sale on QVC. She also marketed a Melania Skin Care Collection, sold in high-end department stores.[42] According to a financial filing in 2016, her businesses brought in between $15,000 and $50,000 in royalties that year.[43] In 2017, the two companies that manufactured her jewelry and skincare products under license said they had terminated their relationship with her.[44] On inauguration day her companies and products were listed in her official White House biography, but they were quickly removed.[45] A White House spokesperson said her companies are no longer active and \"the First Lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so.\"[44]\nShe speaks five languages: her native Slovenian, Serbian, English, French, and German.[46]\nKnauss came to the United States from Slovenia in 1996. She resided in the U.S. briefly on a visitor's visa and then obtained H-1B work visas. In 2000 she petitioned for a right to permanent residency under the EB-1 program, a program designed for people with \"extraordinary abilities.\" According to information from the Migration Policy Institute, only 2 percent of people in their field would be expected to qualify. The Washington Post reports that at that time Knauss's credentials included \"runway shows in Europe, a Camel cigarette billboard ad in Times Square and \u2014 in her biggest job at the time \u2014 a spot in the swimsuit edition of Sports Illustrated, which featured her on the beach in a string bikini, hugging a six-foot inflatable whale.\"[47]\nDuring the months that Melania campaigned with her husband prior to his successful bid for presidency, she defended his hard-line on immigration practices and laws by stating that her own path and achievement of citizenship had been legal, unlike those of the individuals Trump was campaigning against. However, investigative reporting done by the Associated Press revealed that she had been paid for 10 modeling jobs she had done before she had obtained her H-1B (work visa) and was still living in the U.S using her visitor visa. The Associated Press commented that \"Foreigners are not allowed to use a visitor visa to work for pay in the U.S. for American companies. Doing so would violate the terms of that visa and could prohibit a foreigner from later changing his or her immigration status in the U.S. or bar the foreigner from the United States again without special permission to come back.\"[6]\nMelania Trump obtained her citizenship in 2006. According to media reports she sponsored her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who went through the immigration process using \"chain migration\", a route that the president has repeatedly criticized.[48][49]\nIn September 1998, Knauss met real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party and the couple began dating[50] while Trump was in the process of divorcing his second wife, Marla Maples. The divorce was finalized in 1999.[51][52] Knauss continued her modeling career[16] with her American magazine cover shoots, including In Style Weddings,[53] New York magazine, Avenue,[54] Philadelphia Style,[55] Vanity Fair,[56] and Vogue.[57] \nIn 1999, the couple gained attention after a lewd interview with Shock jock Howard Stern on his show.[13][58]\nKnauss appeared with Trump while he campaigned for the 2000 Reform Party presidential nomination. When she was asked by The New York Times what her role would be if Donald Trump were to become president, she replied: \"I would be very traditional, like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy.\"[59]\nKnauss and Donald Trump became engaged in 2004. On January 22, 2005, they married in an Anglican service at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception in the ballroom at her husband's Mar-a-Lago estate.[60][61] The marriage was her first and his third. The event was attended by celebrities such as Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Rudy Giuliani, Heidi Klum, Star Jones, P. Diddy, Shaquille O'Neal, Barbara Walters, Conrad Black, Regis Philbin, Simon Cowell, Kelly Ripa, then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and former president Bill Clinton.[61][62] At the reception, Billy Joel serenaded the crowd with \"Just the Way You Are\" and supplied new lyrics to the tune of \"The Lady Is a Tramp\".[61] The Trumps' wedding ceremony and reception were widely covered by the media.[37] She wore a $200,000 dress made by John Galliano of the house of Christian Dior.[61]\nOn March 20, 2006, she gave birth to their son, Barron William Trump.[63] She chose his middle name, while her husband chose his first name.[64]\nIn November 2015, she was asked about her husband's presidential campaign and replied: \"I encouraged him because I know what he will do and what he can do for America. He loves the American people and he wants to help them.\"[65] She played a relatively small role in her husband's campaign, which is atypical of spouses of presidential candidates.[66][67][68]\nIn 2016, she told CNN her focus as first lady would be to help women and children. She also said she would combat cyberbullying, especially among children.[69]\nIn July 2016, her official website was redirected to trump.com. On Twitter, she stated that her site was outdated and did not \"accurately reflect [her] current business and professional interests\".[70]\nOn July 18, 2016, she gave a speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. The speech contained a paragraph that was nearly identical to a paragraph of Michelle Obama's speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.[71][72][73] When asked about the speech, Melania said she wrote the speech herself \"with as little help as possible.\"[74] Two days later, Trump staff writer Meredith McIver took responsibility and apologized for the \"confusion\".[75]\nIn February 2017, she sued Daily Mail and General Trust, the owner of British tabloid, the Daily Mail, seeking $150 million in damages over an August 2016 article that falsely alleged that she had worked for an escort service during her modeling days. The Mail retracted the article, apologized, and printed the retraction from the blogger they were quoting, who said: \"I had no legitimate factual basis to make these false statements and I fully retract them\".[76] The lawsuit stated the article had ruined her \"unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to establish \"multimillion dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which Plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world\".[77] Her claim raised potential ethical questions with its implication that she intended to profit from being first lady.[78]\nOn February 18, 2017, the lawsuit was amended, removing the language about her earning potential and focusing instead on emotional distress.[79] In April 2017, the parties settled the lawsuit and the Daily Mail issued a statement that said, \"We accept that these allegations about Mrs. Trump are not true and we retract and withdraw them.\" The Mail agreed to pay her $2.9 million.[80][81]\nFive days before the election, she told a crowd of supporters in Pennsylvania: \"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers. It is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied, or attacked. It is terrible when that happens on the playground. And it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the Internet.\"[82] Regarding the contrast of her platform with her husband's use of Twitter during his campaign, Melania said shortly after the election that she had rebuked him \"all the time\" but that \"he will do what he wants to do in the end\".[83]\nShe assumed the role of first lady of the United States on January 20, 2017.[84][85] She continued living in Manhattan at the Trump Tower with their son, Barron, until the end of his 2016\u20132017 school year at Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School.[86][87] They moved into the White House in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2017.[88] Her Secret Service code name is \"Muse\" (beginning with the same letter as Trump's code name, \"Mogul\", per Secret Service tradition).[89] Her staff of 13 (as of January 2018) is smaller than that of the two previous first ladies after one year of their husbands' administration.[90]\nShe is the second foreign-born woman to hold the title of first lady, after Louisa Adams, wife of John Quincy Adams, who was born in 1775 in London to a father from Maryland and an English mother.[91][92] She is also the first naturalized citizen (rather than birthright citizen) to hold the title, and the first whose native language is not English.[93]\nOn March 8, 2017, she hosted her first White House event, a luncheon for International Women's Day. She spoke to an audience of women about her life as a female immigrant, and about working towards gender equality both domestically and abroad, noting the role of education as a tool against gender inequality.[94][95][96]\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that during a three-month period where she lived in New York in 2017, she took Air Force jet flights between New York City, Florida and Washington at a cost of more than $675,000 to taxpayers.[97][98] In comparison, former first lady Michelle Obama's solo travel cost an average of about $350,000 a year.[97][98]\nOn March 13, 2018, Trump scheduled a March 20 meeting with policy executives from technology companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Snap, and Twitter, to address online harassment and Internet safety, with a particular focus on how those issues affect children.[99] Trump's office has avoided the use of the term \"cyberbullying,\"[99] and Trump has come under criticism for championing Internet civility while her husband's Internet behavior has been noted as uncivil.[99][100] Trump attended the roundtable event, focusing on how children are affected by modern technology. Trump said: \"I am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\" but \"that will not stop me from doing what I know is right.\"[101]\nMelania took an active role in planning the Trump administration's first state dinner on April 23, 2018, to honor French president Emmanuel Macron.[102] With Brigitte Macron, the French president's wife, Trump visited a Paul C\u00e9zanne exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington the day before.[103][104][105]\nIn October 2018, Trump took a four-country, solo tour of Africa, without her husband, focusing on conservation and children and families, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt.[106]\nOn November 13, 2018, Trump issued an \"extraordinary\" public statement calling for the firing of Deputy National Security Advisor Mira Ricardel. She had reportedly been privately pushing for Ricardel's ouster for weeks. The next day it was announced that Ricardel would \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"[107] It was described as unusual for a first lady to be publicly involved in White House personnel decisions.[108]\nDuring the El Paso shooting in Texas on August 3, 2019, a lone gunman killed 22 people and injured 24 others. Melania and President Trump visited the hospital where eight of the survivors were being cared for. The president and first lady met with the families of survivors, hospital staff and first responders, and posed with a baby who had been orphaned when both of his parents were killed. The White House had asked that the child be brought in and he was accompanied by his uncle.[109][110]\nDuring the 2020 State of the Union Address, President Trump awarded Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Free, who was sitting right beside Melania in the gallery, in which she presented the medal to him.[111][112]\nOn May 7, 2018, Trump formally started the Be Best public awareness campaign, which focused on well-being for youth and advocated against cyberbullying and drug use.[113] The campaign was accompanied by a booklet that was promoted as having been written \"By First Lady Melania Trump and the Federal Trade Commission [FTC]\", but it was nearly identical to a document prepared in 2014 by the FTC.[114] The similarities prompted accusations of plagiarism, to which her office responded by admonishing the press for reporting on the issue.[115] The fact-checking site Snopes found the charge of plagiarism \"Mostly False\" saying, \"Melania Trump did not claim she had written the pamphlet herself, and she contributed an introduction to a slightly revised version of the booklet. The FTC was always credited for the creation of the booklet and supported its inclusion in the first lady's 'Be Best' campaign.\"[116]\nOn June 17, 2018, Melania was referring to the Trump administration's \"Zero Tolerance\" immigration policy under which children were separated from their parents when she stated that she \"hates to see children separated from their families\" and wants there to be \"successful immigration reform.\"[117] On June 21, she made a hastily planned trip to Texas to get a firsthand look at the crisis affecting immigrant families at the U.S. border. She attended a roundtable with doctors, medical staff, social workers and other experts at Upbring New Hope Children's Shelter.[118]\nTrump became a fashion icon almost immediately after her husband's inauguration on January 20, 2017, with various media outlets reporting on her fashion choices. Vogue has compared Trump's wardrobe as first lady to that of Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan, noting that she closely works with designer Herv\u00e9 Pierre and prefers \"strongly tailored pieces\" in bold colors and almost exclusively wears high-end designers.[119][120]\nWhen the president and first lady visited Vatican City in May 2017, she identified as Catholic. She is the first Catholic to live in the White House since President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline and is the second Catholic first lady of the United States.[121][122] When she visited the Vatican, Pope Francis blessed her rosary beads, and she placed flowers at the feet of a statue of Mary at the Vatican's children's hospital.[123]\nHer husband describes himself as Presbyterian, and Melania and Donald Trump were married at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[124][125][126] Their son Barron was baptized there as well.[127]\nOn May 14, 2018, she underwent an embolization, which is a minimally invasive procedure that deliberately blocks a blood vessel[128] in order to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful and there were no reported complications.[129]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nKellyanne Elizabeth Conway (n\u00e9e Fitzpatrick; born January 20, 1967) is an American pollster, political consultant, and pundit who serves as counselor to the president in the administration of U.S. president Donald Trump. She was previously Trump's campaign manager, having been appointed in August 2016; Conway is the first woman to have run a successful U.S. presidential campaign.[1] She has previously held roles as campaign manager and strategist in the Republican Party, and was formerly president and CEO of The Polling Company, Inc./WomanTrend.[2] Conway, who lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and conducted private polls for Trump in late 2013 when he was considering running for governor of New York, initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primaries in 2016 and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee.[3][4][5][6] After Cruz withdrew from the race, Trump appointed Conway as a senior advisor and later campaign manager.[7][8] On December 22, 2016, Trump announced that Conway would join his administration as counselor to the president.[9] On November 29, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Conway would oversee White House efforts to combat the opioid overdose epidemic.[10][11] Since Trump's inauguration, Conway has been embroiled in a series of controversies: using the phrase \"alternative facts\", talking about a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that never occurred, and claiming that Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. Members of Congress from both parties called for an investigation of an apparent ethics violation after she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump.[12] In June 2019, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel recommended that Conway be fired for \"unprecedented\" multiple violations of the Hatch Act of 1939.[13] Kellyanne Elizabeth Fitzpatrick was born on January 20, 1967, in Atco, New Jersey, to Diane and John Fitzpatrick.[14][15] Conway's father had German, English, and Irish ancestry, while her mother is of Italian descent;[16] John Fitzpatrick owned a small trucking company, and Diane worked at a bank. Conway was abandoned by her father, and her parents divorced when she was three.[17][18] She was raised by her mother, grandmother and two unmarried aunts in the Atco section of Waterford Township, New Jersey, and graduated from St. Joseph High School in 1985, where she sang in the choir, played field hockey, worked on floats for parades, and was a cheerleader.[19] A 1992 New Jersey Organized Crime Commission report identified Conway's grandfather, Jimmy \"The Brute\" DiNatale, as a mob associate of the Philadelphia crime family; DiNatale did not reside with Conway's grandmother, Conway, and the rest of her family.[17] Conway's cousin, Mark DeMarco, has stated that while in high school, Conway ordered members of the football team to stop bullying him; according to DeMarco, the bullying stopped.[20] Her family is Roman Catholic.[14][21][22] Conway credits her experience working for eight summers on a blueberry farm in Hammonton, New Jersey, for teaching her a strong work ethic. \"The faster you went, the more money you'd make,\" she said. At age 16, she won the New Jersey Blueberry Princess pageant. At age 20, she won the World Champion Blueberry Packing competition: \"Everything I learned about life and business started on that farm.\"[22] Conway graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Trinity College, Washington, D.C. (now Trinity Washington University), where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.[23] She earned a Juris Doctor with honors from the George Washington University Law School in 1992.[24] After graduation, she served as a judicial clerk for Judge Richard A. Levie of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.[25] Conway entered the polling business when she was in law school, working as a research assistant for Wirthlin Group, a Republican polling firm.[24] After graduating, she initially considered working for a law firm, but chose to work for Luntz Research Companies instead.[26] While a student at Trinity College, she had met and become friends with Frank Luntz, the founder, on a year abroad at Oxford University.[26] In 1995, she founded her own firm, the Polling Company. Conway's company has consulted on consumer trends, often trends regarding women. Conway's clients have included Vaseline, American Express and Hasbro.[27] In the 1990s, Conway, along with other young conservative women Laura Ingraham, Barbara Olson, and Ann Coulter,[24] helped turn punditry into \"stylish stardom\" in both Washington and cable television[28][29] and credited with setting forth Washington D.C.'s \"sexual awakening.\"[30] In another review of the era in the capital, Conway (then known as Fitzpatrick) put it that her \"broad mind and small waist have not switched places\".[31] Conway, Ingraham, and Coulter were sometimes called \"pundettes\"[32] and appeared on Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect.[24] Conway worked for U.S. Representative Jack Kemp; Senator Fred Thompson;[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Vice President Dan Quayle;[33] Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; and Representative (now Vice President) Mike Pence.[27] She worked as the senior advisor to Gingrich during his unsuccessful 2012 United States presidential election campaign.[34] Another client in 2012 was U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin.[35] In addition to her political opinion research work, Conway has directed demographic and attitudinal survey projects for trade associations and private companies, including American Express, ABC News, Major League Baseball, and Ladies Home Journal.[25] Her firm The Polling Company also includes WomanTrend, a research and consulting division.[25] Conway has appeared as a commentator on polling and the political scene, having appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, NY1, and the Fox News Channel, in addition to various radio programs. She received the Washington Post's \"Crystal Ball\" award for accurately predicting the outcome of the 2004 election.[36] Conway has been criticized as a spin doctor of high prominence, particularly in her role as cable TV spokesperson for the Trump Administration.[37] She has been lauded as a \"Trump whisperer.\"[4] As part of their long-running feud with Donald Trump,[38] the MSNBC show Morning Joe publicly \"banned\" Conway in February 2017.[39] When the 2016 election campaigns got underway, Conway had been acquainted with Donald Trump for years, because she lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and sat on the condo board.[4] Yet she initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee known as Keep the Promise I, which was almost entirely funded by businessman Robert Mercer.[40][41] Conway's organization criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as \"extreme\" and \"not a conservative\".[5][6] On January 25, 2016, Conway criticized Trump as \"a man who seems to be offending his way to the nomination.\"[42] On January 26, Conway criticized Trump's use of eminent domain, saying \"Donald Trump has literally bulldozed over the little guy to get his way.\"[43] In mid-June 2016, Cruz suspended his campaign and Conway left.[44] On July 1, 2016, Trump announced that he had hired Conway for a senior advisory position on his presidential campaign.[45] Conway was expected to advise Trump on how to better appeal to female voters.[45] On August 19, following the resignation of Paul Manafort, Trump named Conway the campaign's third campaign manager.[27][46] She served in this capacity for 10 weeks, through the November 8 general election, and was the first woman to successfully run an American presidential campaign,[1] and the first woman to run a Republican general election presidential campaign.[46] Since October 2016, Conway has been satirized on Saturday Night Live, in which she is portrayed by Kate McKinnon.[47][48][49] In a January 2017 interview, Conway acknowledged the SNL parody by noting that, \"Kate McKinnon clearly sees the road to the future runs through me and not Hillary.\"[50][51] On November 10, 2016, Conway tweeted publicly that Trump had offered her a White House job.[52] \"I can have any job I want\", she said on November 28.[53] On November 24, Conway tweeted that she was \"Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state\" with a link to an article on Trump loyalists' discontent for the 2012 nominee. Conway told CNN she was only tweeting what she has shared with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in private.[54] On November 28, two top sources at the Trump transition team told media outlets that Trump \"was furious\" at Conway for media comments she made on Trump administration cabinet appointments.[55] The following day, however, Trump released a written statement stating that the campaign sources were wrong and that he had expressed disappointment at her critical comments on Romney.[56] CNBC reported on November 28 that senior officials in the Trump transition \"have reportedly been growing frustrated by Conway's failure to become a team player.\"[53] On December 1, Conway appeared with senior aides of the Trump campaign, at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, for a forum on the 2016 presidential race; the quadrennial post-presidential election forum has been held at the School of Government since 1972. Sitting across from Conway were senior Clinton campaign aides, including Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook. As tempers began to flare, the forum escalated into a \"shouting match\"; during one exchange, Clinton senior strategist Joel Benenson said \"The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump.\" Conway replied to Benenson while looking at the Trump aides: \"Hey, guys, we won. You don't have to respond. He was the better candidate. That's why he won.\"[57] In early December, Conway claimed that Hillary Clinton supporters were making death threats against her.[58] Consequently, Trump assigned Secret Service to protect her.[59][60][61] Conway gave up her Secret Service protection in September 2017 due to \"reduction in threats.\"[62][63][64] According to eyewitnesses, Conway allegedly punched a tuxedo-clad man at an exclusive inauguration ball just hours after Donald Trump was sworn in as president.[65][66] In an attempt to break up a scuffle, Conway stepped between two men, but they would not break up the fight, and Conway apparently punched one of them in the face with closed fists at least three times.[67] It was not immediately clear what triggered the fistfight and a Trump spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.[68] During a Meet the Press interview two days after Trump's presidential inauguration, Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts\" to defend statements made by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer regarding the inauguration's crowd size.[69][70][71] Conway's phrase reminded liberal-leaning commentators of \"Newspeak\", an obfuscatory language style that is a key element of the society portrayed in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984.[72] Soon after Conway's interview, sales of the book had increased by 9,500%, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.[73] A week later, the conservative daily magazine American Thinker argued that the \"tidal wave of derision hoisted upon President Trump's senior adviser\" had been rather shocking to observe because the derision had been \"so spectacularly off base\". The magazine asserted that the phrase \"alternative facts\" was in common use in law and that it was known to most lawyers, including Conway, with her George Washington University Law School degree, adding that, \"it seems eminently possible that Ms. Conway knew exactly what it was she was saying.\" After giving examples of legal[74] and non-legal uses of the phrase \"alternative facts\", the article contended that when Chuck Todd upbraided Kellyanne Conway with the claim that \"alternative facts are not facts; they're falsehoods\", he was not only wrong, but \"propagating an ignorance born out of lazy and shallow thinking\".[75] The Guardian noted that \"[a] search of several online legal dictionaries, however, did not yield any results for the term.\"[76] On February 2, 2017, Conway appeared in a television news show interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews. In order to justify President Trump's immigration ban, she referenced an event allegedly perpetrated by Iraqi terrorists she termed the \"Bowling Green massacre\". Such an event never took place.[77][78] Vox suggested Conway was referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky.[78] Conway stated the next day that she meant to say \"Bowling Green terrorists\", both of whom had pleaded guilty to carrying out and supporting attacks on American soldiers in Iraq.[79] There was never any suggestion that they had planned to carry out attacks in the United States.[80] On February 5, 2017, New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen argued that, given repeated misstatements of fact, Conway should cease being booked as a guest on television news shows. CNN opted not to book Conway as a guest that day because of what the network said were \"serious questions about her credibility.\"[81][82] The Hatch Act of 1939 states that federal government employees must not advocate their political beliefs while representing a public office. Violating such a law can result in such an employee being removed from public office, but not jailed.[83] On February 9, 2017, during an appearance on Fox & Friends, Conway discussed department store Nordstrom's decision to drop products supplied by Ivanka Trump's business. \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you\", said Conway; she elaborated \"It's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online\".[84][85] Within hours, two organizations filed formal ethics complaints against Conway for violating federal law prohibiting use of a federal position \"for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise\".[86] Public Citizen asked the Office of Governmental Ethics (OGE) to investigate, saying that Conway's remarks reflected \"an on-going careless regard of the conflicts of interest laws and regulations of some members of the Trump family and Trump Administration\". The group's president, Robert Weissman, declared, \"Since she said it was an advertisement, that both eliminates any question about whether outsiders are unfairly reading into what's being said, and two, it makes clear that wasn't an inadvertent remark\".[87] Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a similar complaint with the OGE and with the White House Counsel's Office;[88] the group's executive director, Noah Bookbinder, stated \"This seems to us to be about as clear-cut a violation as you can find\".[89] Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe told The New York Times that \"You couldn't think of a clearer example of violating the ban of using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual,\" adding \"She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president's family.\"[89] Chris Lu, deputy secretary of labor in the Obama administration, complained to Jason Chaffetz, chair of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, that Conway had violated federal ethics laws,[90] also saying on Twitter that, under Obama, \"If we did what @KellyannePolls did, we would've been fired\".[91] Richard Painter, chief ethics attorney for George W. Bush, declined to say whether he thought Conway's statements broke the law, but that such actions would not have been tolerated in the Bush administration. \"The events of the past week demonstrate that there is no intent on the part of the president, his family or the White House staff to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business\".[89] At the regularly scheduled afternoon press briefing, Sean Spicer told reporters that \"Kellyanne has been counseled, and that's all we are going to go with ... She's been counseled on the subject, and that's it.\"[92] In a direct rebuke to Spicer, Conway tweeted that Trump \"likes 'counselor' more than 'counseled.'\"[93][94] Conway's comments drew bipartisan Congressional condemnation. Chaffetz, a Republican, called them \"clearly over the line\" and \"unacceptable\". Cummings, a Democrat and the committee's ranking member, called them \"jaw-dropping\",[95] Both Chaffetz and Cummings wrote the United States Office of Government Ethics on February 9, 2017, requesting that Conway's behavior be investigated and that the office recommend \"suggested disciplinary action, if warranted\".[12] On November 24, 2017, Walter Shaub, the former director of the OGE, said that he filed an ethics complaint against Conway.[96] He argued that Conway violated the Hatch Act of 1939 when she criticized Doug Jones, a candidate in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama.[96] On March 6, 2018, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) \u2014 led by Trump appointee Henry Kerner \u2014 issued its final report, determining that Conway violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews in November and December 2017.[97][98] Conway continued to make frequent television appearances and comment on political topics. In May 2019, Conway declared: \"If you\u2019re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it's not going to work ... Let me know when the jail sentence starts\".[99] On June 13, 2019, the OSC formally recommended that Conway be removed from federal service, citing multiple Hatch Act violations by Conway since the preparation of its 2018 report, \"by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media\". The OSC noted her criticism from February to May 2019 of candidates such as Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Kirsten Gillibrand, and also called her violations \"egregious, notorious, and ongoing\". The OSC noted that this was the first time they \"had to issue multiple reports to the President concerning Hatch Act violations by the same individual\".[13][100][101] In an interview, Kerner characterized his agency's recommendation as unprecedented, adding, \"You know what else is unprecedented? Kellyanne Conway\u2019s behavior.\"[13] Due to Conway's status as a presidential appointee, the OSC was unable to take any steps to implement its recommendation, but it was submitted to President Trump for consideration.[102][103][104] The White House immediately rejected the finding and demanded that it be withdrawn by the OSC.[105] Trump said he thought the recommendation was \"very unfair, it's called freedom of speech.\"[106] On June 26, 2019, Conway did not appear at a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, leading that committee to issue a subpoena for her. At that hearing, Special Counsel Henry Kerner testified that Conway had been found guilty of 2 Hatch Act violations in 2018 and 11 in 2019. In comparison, during the eight years of the Obama administration, only 2 federal employees were found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, with 1 violation each.[107] On February 13, 2017, Conway claimed that former national security advisor Michael Flynn had the president's \"full confidence\". Hours later, Flynn resigned.[108] The following day, Conway claimed Flynn had offered to resign, but White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump had asked Flynn for his resignation.[108] It was then reported that Conway had allegedly leaked negative stories about Spicer to the press.[109] She came under widespread criticism because her comments about Flynn had been so inaccurate. On February 15, 2017, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin said Conway should be banned from future television appearances. \"In recent days, George Stephanopoulos and Matt Lauer blasted her directly, essentially calling her a fabulist. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment\", Rubin wrote.[110] Also on February 15 the MSNBC news show Morning Joe officially banned her from future appearances. The show's primary host Joe Scarborough said the decision to ban Conway from the show was based on her being \"out of the loop\" and \"in none of the key meetings\". He added \"She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance.\"[39] The show's co-host Mika Brzezinski said, \"I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect.\"[39] For the week following her Flynn comments she did not appear on any television shows, and it was reported that the White House had sidelined Conway.[108] Denying the report, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNNMoney that Conway was going to make many appearances during the week, and Conway told CNN journalist Dylan Byers that she would be appearing on Fox News that evening.[108] The week-long absence from television finally ended when she appeared on an episode of Hannity during the Conservative Political Action Conference.[111] Conway came under criticism when she was photographed sitting on an Oval Office couch with her legs folded beneath her \u2014 shoes pressed against the upholstery \u2014 during President Trump's meeting with leaders from historically black colleges and universities.[112][113] Some observers suggested the sitting position was a sign of disrespect and a lack of decorum.[114] Body language expert Patti Wood asserted that Conway's posture was not only rude, but \"rather sexual\", and a sign that she \"doesn't have to follow the rules\" because she was \"buddies with Trump.\"[115] Conway later addressed the controversy with Lou Dobbs, saying that she was asked to take photographs of the meeting from a certain angle and that she certainly meant \"no disrespect.\" She also blamed the media for the ensuing furor.[116][114] Conway views herself as a Generation X conservative.[117][118] Conway is pro-life, saying in 1996: \"We're pro-life. The fetus beat us. We grew up with sonograms. We know life when we see it.\"[118] She spoke at the 2017 March for Life, an annual rally protesting abortion and Roe v. Wade.[119] She does not consider herself a feminist \"in a classical sense\" because she believes the term is associated with being \"anti-male\" and \"pro-abortion\", but rather identifies as what she calls an \"individual feminist\".[120] Conway believes that many feminists fail to accept women who are pro-life and conservative, and has stated that such feminists \"'mainly care about what happens from the waist down... It's an insult. You know, it's [from] the waist up for me \u2014 my eyes, my ears, my head, my heart, my mouth certainly.'\"[20] She has also stated that \"nobody cared\" about her experience with sexual harassment and her Me Too moment due to her political views.[121] Conway is married to George T. Conway III,[122] who is of counsel at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and wrote the Supreme Court brief for Paula Jones during the Clinton impeachment in 1998.[123][124] The couple have four children: twins Claudia and George IV, Charlotte, and Vanessa.[124] They live in Alpine, New Jersey.[25][125][126] Prior to her marriage, she dated the late senator and 2008 presidential candidate Fred Thompson.[127][128][129] In September 2019, Conway's cousin Giovanna Coia, who is White House Press Assistant, married Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence, who works for Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign.[130][131][132] In March 2019, President Trump responded to criticism from Kellyanne's husband George by describing George as a \"stone cold LOSER & husband from hell\". Kellyanne defended her boss, Trump, by saying that George Conway is \"not a psychiatrist\" and that Trump should be expected to respond when George, \"a non-medical professional accuses him of having a mental disorder\".[133] One of the few White House staffers to have protection from the Secret Service due to various threats, Conway chose \"Blueberry\" as her Secret Service code name because of associations with the fruit from her youth in pageants and berry picking.[134] In a September 2018 interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Conway stated she was the victim of a sexual assault.[135][136] In 2005, Conway and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake co-authored What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class, and Religious Lines to Change the Way We Live (Free Press/Simon & Schuster, 2005; .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN\u00a00-7432-7382-6).",

She was previously Trump's campaign manager, having been appointed in August 2016; Conway is the first woman to have run a successful U.S. presidential campaign.[1] She has previously held roles as campaign manager and strategist in the Republican Party, and was formerly president and CEO of The Polling Company, Inc./WomanTrend.[2]\nConway, who lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and conducted private polls for Trump in late 2013 when he was considering running for governor of New York, initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primaries in 2016 and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee.[3][4][5][6] After Cruz withdrew from the race, Trump appointed Conway as a senior advisor and later campaign manager.[7][8] On December 22, 2016, Trump announced that Conway would join his administration as counselor to the president.[9] On November 29, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Conway would oversee White House efforts to combat the opioid overdose epidemic.[10][11]\nSince Trump's inauguration, Conway has been embroiled in a series of controversies: using the phrase \"alternative facts\", talking about a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that never occurred, and claiming that Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. Members of Congress from both parties called for an investigation of an apparent ethics violation after she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump.[12] In June 2019, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel recommended that Conway be fired for \"unprecedented\" multiple violations of the Hatch Act of 1939.[13]\nKellyanne Elizabeth Fitzpatrick was born on January 20, 1967, in Atco, New Jersey, to Diane and John Fitzpatrick.[14][15] Conway's father had German, English, and Irish ancestry, while her mother is of Italian descent;[16] John Fitzpatrick owned a small trucking company, and Diane worked at a bank. Conway was abandoned by her father, and her parents divorced when she was three.[17][18] She was raised by her mother, grandmother and two unmarried aunts in the Atco section of Waterford Township, New Jersey, and graduated from St. Joseph High School in 1985, where she sang in the choir, played field hockey, worked on floats for parades, and was a cheerleader.[19] A 1992 New Jersey Organized Crime Commission report identified Conway's grandfather, Jimmy \"The Brute\" DiNatale, as a mob associate of the Philadelphia crime family; DiNatale did not reside with Conway's grandmother, Conway, and the rest of her family.[17] Conway's cousin, Mark DeMarco, has stated that while in high school, Conway ordered members of the football team to stop bullying him; according to DeMarco, the bullying stopped.[20] Her family is Roman Catholic.[14][21][22]\nConway credits her experience working for eight summers on a blueberry farm in Hammonton, New Jersey, for teaching her a strong work ethic. \"The faster you went, the more money you'd make,\" she said. At age 16, she won the New Jersey Blueberry Princess pageant. At age 20, she won the World Champion Blueberry Packing competition: \"Everything I learned about life and business started on that farm.\"[22]\nConway graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Trinity College, Washington, D.C. (now Trinity Washington University), where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.[23] She earned a Juris Doctor with honors from the George Washington University Law School in 1992.[24] After graduation, she served as a judicial clerk for Judge Richard A. Levie of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.[25]\nConway entered the polling business when she was in law school, working as a research assistant for Wirthlin Group, a Republican polling firm.[24] After graduating, she initially considered working for a law firm, but chose to work for Luntz Research Companies instead.[26] While a student at Trinity College, she had met and become friends with Frank Luntz, the founder, on a year abroad at Oxford University.[26] In 1995, she founded her own firm, the Polling Company. Conway's company has consulted on consumer trends, often trends regarding women. Conway's clients have included Vaseline, American Express and Hasbro.[27]\nIn the 1990s, Conway, along with other young conservative women Laura Ingraham, Barbara Olson, and Ann Coulter,[24] helped turn punditry into \"stylish stardom\" in both Washington and cable television[28][29] and credited with setting forth Washington D.C.'s \"sexual awakening.\"[30] In another review of the era in the capital, Conway (then known as Fitzpatrick) put it that her \"broad mind and small waist have not switched places\".[31] Conway, Ingraham, and Coulter were sometimes called \"pundettes\"[32] and appeared on Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect.[24]\nConway worked for U.S. Representative Jack Kemp; Senator Fred Thompson;[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Vice President Dan Quayle;[33] Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; and Representative (now Vice President) Mike Pence.[27] She worked as the senior advisor to Gingrich during his unsuccessful 2012 United States presidential election campaign.[34] Another client in 2012 was U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin.[35]\nIn addition to her political opinion research work, Conway has directed demographic and attitudinal survey projects for trade associations and private companies, including American Express, ABC News, Major League Baseball, and Ladies Home Journal.[25] Her firm The Polling Company also includes WomanTrend, a research and consulting division.[25]\nConway has appeared as a commentator on polling and the political scene, having appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, NY1, and the Fox News Channel, in addition to various radio programs. She received the Washington Post's \"Crystal Ball\" award for accurately predicting the outcome of the 2004 election.[36]\nConway has been criticized as a spin doctor of high prominence, particularly in her role as cable TV spokesperson for the Trump Administration.[37] She has been lauded as a \"Trump whisperer.\"[4] As part of their long-running feud with Donald Trump,[38] the MSNBC show Morning Joe publicly \"banned\" Conway in February 2017.[39]\nWhen the 2016 election campaigns got underway, Conway had been acquainted with Donald Trump for years, because she lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and sat on the condo board.[4] Yet she initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee known as Keep the Promise I, which was almost entirely funded by businessman Robert Mercer.[40][41] Conway's organization criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as \"extreme\" and \"not a conservative\".[5][6]  On January 25, 2016, Conway criticized Trump as \"a man who seems to be offending his way to the nomination.\"[42] On January 26, Conway criticized Trump's use of eminent domain, saying \"Donald Trump has literally bulldozed over the little guy to get his way.\"[43]\nIn mid-June 2016, Cruz suspended his campaign and Conway left.[44]\nOn July 1, 2016, Trump announced that he had hired Conway for a senior advisory position on his presidential campaign.[45] Conway was expected to advise Trump on how to better appeal to female voters.[45] On August 19, following the resignation of Paul Manafort, Trump named Conway the campaign's third campaign manager.[27][46] She served in this capacity for 10 weeks, through the November 8 general election, and was the first woman to successfully run an American presidential campaign,[1] and the first woman to run a Republican general election presidential campaign.[46] Since October 2016, Conway has been satirized on Saturday Night Live, in which she is portrayed by Kate McKinnon.[47][48][49] In a January 2017 interview, Conway acknowledged the SNL parody by noting that, \"Kate McKinnon clearly sees the road to the future runs through me and not Hillary.\"[50][51]\nOn November 10, 2016, Conway tweeted publicly that Trump had offered her a White House job.[52] \"I can have any job I want\", she said on November 28.[53] On November 24, Conway tweeted that she was \"Receiving deluge of social media &amp; private comms re: Romney. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state\" with a link to an article on Trump loyalists' discontent for the 2012 nominee. Conway told CNN she was only tweeting what she has shared with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in private.[54]\nOn November 28, two top sources at the Trump transition team told media outlets that Trump \"was furious\" at Conway for media comments she made on Trump administration cabinet appointments.[55] The following day, however, Trump released a written statement stating that the campaign sources were wrong and that he had expressed disappointment at her critical comments on Romney.[56] CNBC reported on November 28 that senior officials in the Trump transition \"have reportedly been growing frustrated by Conway's failure to become a team player.\"[53]\nOn December 1, Conway appeared with senior aides of the Trump campaign, at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, for a forum on the 2016 presidential race; the quadrennial post-presidential election forum has been held at the School of Government since 1972. Sitting across from Conway were senior Clinton campaign aides, including Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook. As tempers began to flare, the forum escalated into a \"shouting match\"; during one exchange, Clinton senior strategist Joel Benenson said \"The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump.\" Conway replied to Benenson while looking at the Trump aides: \"Hey, guys, we won. You don't have to respond. He was the better candidate. That's why he won.\"[57]\nIn early December, Conway claimed that Hillary Clinton supporters were making death threats against her.[58] Consequently, Trump assigned Secret Service to protect her.[59][60][61] Conway gave up her Secret Service protection in September 2017 due to \"reduction in threats.\"[62][63][64]\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Conway allegedly punched a tuxedo-clad man at an exclusive inauguration ball just hours after Donald Trump was sworn in as president.[65][66] In an attempt to break up a scuffle, Conway stepped between two men, but they would not break up the fight, and Conway apparently punched one of them in the face with closed fists at least three times.[67]\nIt was not immediately clear what triggered the fistfight and a Trump spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.[68]\nDuring a Meet the Press interview two days after Trump's presidential inauguration, Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts\" to defend statements made by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer regarding the inauguration's crowd size.[69][70][71] Conway's phrase reminded liberal-leaning commentators of \"Newspeak\", an obfuscatory language style that is a key element of the society portrayed in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984.[72] Soon after Conway's interview, sales of the book had increased by 9,500%, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.[73]\nA week later, the conservative daily magazine American Thinker argued that the \"tidal wave of derision hoisted upon President Trump's senior adviser\" had been rather shocking to observe because the derision had been \"so spectacularly off base\". The magazine asserted that the phrase \"alternative facts\" was in common use in law and that it was known to most lawyers, including Conway, with her George Washington University Law School degree, adding that, \"it seems eminently possible that Ms. Conway knew exactly what it was she was saying.\" After giving examples of legal[74] and non-legal uses of the phrase \"alternative facts\", the article contended that when Chuck Todd upbraided Kellyanne Conway with the claim that \"alternative facts are not facts; they're falsehoods\", he was not only wrong, but \"propagating an ignorance born out of lazy and shallow thinking\".[75]\nThe Guardian noted that \"[a] search of several online legal dictionaries, however, did not yield any results for the term.\"[76]\nOn February 2, 2017, Conway appeared in a television news show interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews. In order to justify President Trump's immigration ban, she referenced an event allegedly perpetrated by Iraqi terrorists she termed the \"Bowling Green massacre\". Such an event never took place.[77][78] Vox suggested Conway was referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky.[78] Conway stated the next day that she meant to say \"Bowling Green terrorists\", both of whom had pleaded guilty to carrying out and supporting attacks on American soldiers in Iraq.[79] There was never any suggestion that they had planned to carry out attacks in the United States.[80]\nOn February 5, 2017, New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen argued that, given repeated misstatements of fact, Conway should cease being booked as a guest on television news shows. CNN opted not to book Conway as a guest that day because of what the network said were \"serious questions about her credibility.\"[81][82]\nThe Hatch Act of 1939 states that federal government employees must not advocate their political beliefs while representing a public office. Violating such a law can result in such an employee being removed from public office, but not jailed.[83]\nOn February 9, 2017, during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, Conway discussed department store Nordstrom's decision to drop products supplied by Ivanka Trump's business. \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff is what I would tell you\", said Conway; she elaborated \"It's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online\".[84][85] Within hours, two organizations filed formal ethics complaints against Conway for violating federal law prohibiting use of a federal position \"for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise\".[86] Public Citizen asked the Office of Governmental Ethics (OGE) to investigate, saying that Conway's remarks reflected \"an on-going careless regard of the conflicts of interest laws and regulations of some members of the Trump family and Trump Administration\". The group's president, Robert Weissman, declared, \"Since she said it was an advertisement, that both eliminates any question about whether outsiders are unfairly reading into what's being said, and two, it makes clear that wasn't an inadvertent remark\".[87] Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a similar complaint with the OGE and with the White House Counsel's Office;[88] the group's executive director, Noah Bookbinder, stated \"This seems to us to be about as clear-cut a violation as you can find\".[89]\nHarvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe told The New York Times that \"You couldn't think of a clearer example of violating the ban of using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual,\" adding \"She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president's family.\"[89] Chris Lu, deputy secretary of labor in the Obama administration, complained to Jason Chaffetz, chair of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, that Conway had violated federal ethics laws,[90] also saying on Twitter that, under Obama, \"If we did what @KellyannePolls did, we would've been fired\".[91] Richard Painter, chief ethics attorney for George W. Bush, declined to say whether he thought Conway's statements broke the law, but that such actions would not have been tolerated in the Bush administration. \"The events of the past week demonstrate that there is no intent on the part of the president, his family or the White House staff to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business\".[89] At the regularly scheduled afternoon press briefing, Sean Spicer told reporters that \"Kellyanne has been counseled, and that's all we are going to go with ... She's been counseled on the subject, and that's it.\"[92] In a direct rebuke to Spicer, Conway tweeted that Trump \"likes 'counselor' more than 'counseled.'\"[93][94]\nConway's comments drew bipartisan Congressional condemnation. Chaffetz, a Republican, called them \"clearly over the line\" and \"unacceptable\". Cummings, a Democrat and the committee's ranking member, called them \"jaw-dropping\",[95] Both Chaffetz and Cummings wrote the United States Office of Government Ethics on February 9, 2017, requesting that Conway's behavior be investigated and that the office recommend \"suggested disciplinary action, if warranted\".[12]\nOn November 24, 2017, Walter Shaub, the former director of the OGE, said that he filed an ethics complaint against Conway.[96] He argued that Conway violated the Hatch Act of 1939 when she criticized Doug Jones, a candidate in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama.[96] On March 6, 2018, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) \u2014 led by Trump appointee Henry Kerner \u2014 issued its final report, determining that Conway violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews in November and December 2017.[97][98]\nConway continued to make frequent television appearances and comment on political topics. In May 2019, Conway declared: \"If you\u2019re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it's not going to work ... Let me know when the jail sentence starts\".[99]\nOn June 13, 2019, the OSC formally recommended that Conway be removed from federal service, citing multiple Hatch Act violations by Conway since the preparation of its 2018 report, \"by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media\". The OSC noted her criticism from February to May 2019 of candidates such as Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Kirsten Gillibrand, and also called her violations \"egregious, notorious, and ongoing\". The OSC noted that this was the first time they \"had to issue multiple reports to the President concerning Hatch Act violations by the same individual\".[13][100][101] In an interview, Kerner characterized his agency's recommendation as unprecedented, adding, \"You know what else is unprecedented? Kellyanne Conway\u2019s behavior.\"[13]\nDue to Conway's status as a presidential appointee, the OSC was unable to take any steps to implement its recommendation, but it was submitted to President Trump for consideration.[102][103][104] The White House immediately rejected the finding and demanded that it be withdrawn by the OSC.[105] Trump said he thought the recommendation was \"very unfair, it's called freedom of speech.\"[106]\nOn June 26, 2019, Conway did not appear at a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, leading that committee to issue a subpoena for her. At that hearing, Special Counsel Henry Kerner testified that Conway had been found guilty of 2 Hatch Act violations in 2018 and 11 in 2019. In comparison, during the eight years of the Obama administration, only 2 federal employees were found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, with 1 violation each.[107]\nOn February 13, 2017, Conway claimed that former national security advisor Michael Flynn had the president's \"full confidence\". Hours later, Flynn resigned.[108] The following day, Conway claimed Flynn had offered to resign, but White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump had asked Flynn for his resignation.[108] It was then reported that Conway had allegedly leaked negative stories about Spicer to the press.[109]\nShe came under widespread criticism because her comments about Flynn had been so inaccurate. On February 15, 2017, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin said Conway should be banned from future television appearances. \"In recent days, George Stephanopoulos and Matt Lauer blasted her directly, essentially calling her a fabulist. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment\", Rubin wrote.[110] Also on February 15 the MSNBC news show Morning Joe officially banned her from future appearances. The show's primary host Joe Scarborough said the decision to ban Conway from the show was based on her being \"out of the loop\" and \"in none of the key meetings\". He added \"She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance.\"[39] The show's co-host Mika Brzezinski said, \"I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect.\"[39]\nFor the week following her Flynn comments she did not appear on any television shows, and it was reported that the White House had sidelined Conway.[108] Denying the report, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNNMoney that Conway was going to make many appearances during the week, and Conway told CNN journalist Dylan Byers that she would be appearing on Fox News that evening.[108] The week-long absence from television finally ended when she appeared on an episode of Hannity during the Conservative Political Action Conference.[111]\nConway came under criticism when she was photographed sitting on an Oval Office couch with her legs folded beneath her \u2014 shoes pressed against the upholstery \u2014 during President Trump's meeting with leaders from historically black colleges and universities.[112][113] Some observers suggested the sitting position was a sign of disrespect and a lack of decorum.[114] Body language expert Patti Wood asserted that Conway's posture was not only rude, but \"rather sexual\", and a sign that she \"doesn't have to follow the rules\" because she was \"buddies with Trump.\"[115] Conway later addressed the controversy with Lou Dobbs, saying that she was asked to take photographs of the meeting from a certain angle and that she certainly meant \"no disrespect.\" She also blamed the media for the ensuing furor.[116][114]\nConway views herself as a Generation X conservative.[117][118]\nConway is pro-life, saying in 1996: \"We're pro-life. The fetus beat us. We grew up with sonograms. We know life when we see it.\"[118] She spoke at the 2017 March for Life, an annual rally protesting abortion and Roe v. Wade.[119]\nShe does not consider herself a feminist \"in a classical sense\" because she believes the term is associated with being \"anti-male\" and \"pro-abortion\", but rather identifies as what she calls an \"individual feminist\".[120] Conway believes that many feminists fail to accept women who are pro-life and conservative, and has stated that such feminists \"'mainly care about what happens from the waist down... It's an insult. You know, it's [from] the waist up for me \u2014 my eyes, my ears, my head, my heart, my mouth certainly.'\"[20] She has also stated that \"nobody cared\" about her experience with sexual harassment and her Me Too moment due to her political views.[121]\nConway is married to George T. Conway III,[122] who is of counsel at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, and wrote the Supreme Court brief for Paula Jones during the Clinton impeachment in 1998.[123][124] The couple have four children: twins Claudia and George IV, Charlotte, and Vanessa.[124] They live in Alpine, New Jersey.[25][125][126] Prior to her marriage, she dated the late senator and 2008 presidential candidate Fred Thompson.[127][128][129]\nIn September 2019, Conway's cousin Giovanna Coia, who is White House Press Assistant, married Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence, who works for Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign.[130][131][132]\nIn March 2019, President Trump responded to criticism from Kellyanne's husband George by describing George as a \"stone cold LOSER &amp; husband from hell\". Kellyanne defended her boss, Trump, by saying that George Conway is \"not a psychiatrist\" and that Trump should be expected to respond when George, \"a non-medical professional accuses him of having a mental disorder\".[133]\nOne of the few White House staffers to have protection from the Secret Service due to various threats, Conway chose \"Blueberry\" as her Secret Service code name because of associations with the fruit from her youth in pageants and berry picking.[134]\nIn a September 2018 interview with Jake Tapper on CNN, Conway stated she was the victim of a sexual assault.[135][136]\nIn 2005, Conway and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake co-authored What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class, and Religious Lines to Change the Way We Live (Free Press/Simon &amp; Schuster, 2005; .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN\u00a00-7432-7382-6).\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJared Corey Kushner (born January 10, 1981) is an American investor, real-estate developer, and newspaper publisher who is currently senior advisor to his father-in-law, Donald Trump, the president of the United States. Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer Charles Kushner, the son of Jewish immigrants from the USSR, and is married to Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company Kushner Companies, which launched his business career. He later also bought Observer Media, publisher of the New York Observer. He is the co-founder and part owner of Cadre, an online real-estate investment platform. During the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, Kushner helped develop and run Trump's digital media strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor. Kushner was born in Livingston, New Jersey, to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and Charles Kushner, a real-estate developer.[2] His paternal grandparents, Reichel and Joseph Kushner, were Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from Navahrudak, now in Belarus.[3][4] Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's maternal grandfather.[5] Raised in a Modern Orthodox Jewish family,[6] Kushner graduated from the Frisch School, a Modern Orthodox yeshiva high school, in 1999. He was an honors student and a member of the debate, hockey, and, basketball teams.[7] Kushner enrolled at Harvard University in 1999. According to journalist Daniel Golden, Kushner was accepted due to his father's donations and history with the school.[8][9] He was elected into the Fly Club, supported the campus Chabad house,[10][11] and bought and sold real estate in Somerville, Massachusetts, as a vice president of Somerville Building Associates (a division of Kushner Companies), returning a profit of $20 million by its dissolution in 2005.[12][13][14] Kushner graduated from Harvard in 2003 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government.[15][16] Kushner graduated from New York University in 2007 with dual JD/MBA degrees. He interned at Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office, and at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP.[17] Following his father's conviction for fraud in 2005 and subsequent incarceration, Jared Kushner took over the management of his father's real estate company.[18] As of 2019[update], Kushner's net worth is estimated at about $800 million.[19] Kushner was a real-estate investor, and increased Kushner Companies' presence in the New York City real-estate market.[20] Kushner Companies purchased the office building at 666 Fifth Avenue in 2007, for a then-record price of $1.8 billion, most of it borrowed.[21] He assumed the role of CEO in 2008.[22] Following the property crash that year, the cash flow generated by the property was insufficient to cover its debt service, and the Kushners were forced to sell the retail footage to Stanley Chera[23] and bring in Vornado Realty Trust as a 50% equity partner in the ownership of the building.[24] By that time, Kushner Companies had lost more than $90 million on its investment.[25] He was the face of the deal but his father Charles Kushner pushed him to do the deal.[26] On August 18, 2014, Kushner acquired a three-building apartment portfolio in Middle River, Maryland, for $38 million with Aion Partners. In 2013\u20132014, he and his company acquired more than 11,000 units throughout New York, New Jersey, and the Baltimore area.[27] In May 2015, he purchased 50.1% of the Times Square Building from Africa Israel Investments Ltd. for $295 million.[28] In 2014, Kushner, with his brother Joshua and Ryan Williams, co-founded Cadre (now RealCadre LLC), an online real-estate investment platform. His business partners included Goldman Sachs and billionaire George Soros, a top Democratic Party donor.[29][30][31] In early 2015, Soros Fund Management financed the startup with a $250 million credit line.[29][32] Kushner did not identify these business relationships in his January 2017 government financial-disclosure form.[29][33] In 2006, Kushner purchased The New York Observer, a weekly New York City newspaper, for $10\u00a0million,[34] using money he says he earned during his college years by closing deals on residential buildings in Somerville, Massachusetts,[35] with family members providing the backing for his investments.[36] After purchasing the Observer, Kushner published it in tabloid format.[37] Since then, he has been credited with increasing the Observer's online presence and expanding the Observer Media Group.[38][39] With no substantial experience in journalism, Kushner could not establish a good relationship with the newspaper's veteran editor-in-chief, Peter W. Kaplan.[40] \"This guy doesn't know what he doesn't know\", Kaplan remarked about Kushner, to colleagues, at the time.[40] As a result of his differences with Kushner, Kaplan quit his position. Kaplan was followed by a series of short-lived successors until Kushner hired Elizabeth Spiers in 2011.[41] It has been alleged that Kushner used Observer as propaganda against rivals in real estate.[41][42] Spiers left the newspaper in 2012. In January 2013, Kushner hired a new editor-in-chief, Ken Kurson. Kurson had been a consultant to Republican political candidates in New Jersey.[41] According to Vanity Fair, under Kushner, the \"Observer has lost virtually all of its cultural currency among New York's elite, but the paper is now profitable and reporting traffic growth ... [it] boasts 6 million unique visitors per month, up from 1.3 million in January 2013\".[43] In April 2016, the New York Observer became one of only a handful of newspapers to officially endorse United States presidential candidate Donald Trump in the Republican primary, but the paper ended the campaign period by choosing not to back any presidential candidate at all.[44][45] Kushner stepped down from his newspaper role in January 2017 to pursue a role in President Donald Trump's administration. He was replaced by his brother-in-law, Joseph Meyer.[46] Jared Kushner had been a lifelong Democrat prior to his father-in-law Donald Trump entering politics.[47] He had donated over $10,000 to Democratic campaigns[48] starting at young age of 11. In 2008 he donated to the campaign for Hillary Clinton and his newspaper the New York Observer endorsed Barack Obama over John McCain in the US presidential election.[49] After expressing disappointment with Barack Obama, however, he endorsed Republican U.S. presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 via the New York Observer.[50] In 2014 he continued to donate to Democratic groups,[49] but he then continued his \"ideological conversion\" by joining his father-in-law Donald Trump's nascent US presidential campaign in the field of the Republican candidates in 2015.[55] Kushner had no prior involvement in campaign politics or in government before Trump's campaign.[56] From the outset of the presidential campaign of his father-in-law Donald Trump, Kushner was the architect of Trump's digital, online, and social media campaigns, enlisting talent from Silicon Valley to run a 100-person social-media team dubbed \"Project Alamo\".[57] Kushner, together with Paul Manafort and Brad Parscale, hired Steve Bannon's firm Cambridge Analytica to support the Trump campaign.[58] Kushner has also helped as a speechwriter, and was tasked with working to establish a plan for Trump's White House transition team.[59] He was for a time seen as Trump's de facto campaign manager, succeeding Corey Lewandowski, who was fired in part on Kushner's recommendation in June 2016.[60] He had been intimately involved with campaign strategy, coordinating Trump's visit in late August to Mexico, and he is believed to be responsible for the choice of Mike Pence as Trump's running mate.[57][61] Kushner's \"sprawling digital fundraising database and social media campaign\" has been described as \"the locus of his father-in-law's presidential bid\".[62] According to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt (who worked on technology for Hillary Clinton's campaign), Kushner's role in the 2016 election was its biggest surprise. Schmidt told Forbes, \"Best I can tell, he actually ran the campaign and did it with essentially no resources.\"[63] Federal Election Commission filings indicate the Trump campaign spent $343 million, about 59 percent as much as the Clinton campaign.[64] On July 5, 2016, Kushner wrote an open letter in the New York Observer addressing the controversy around a tweet from the Trump campaign containing allegedly anti-Semitic imagery. He was responding to his own paper's editorial by Dana Schwartz criticizing Kushner's involvement with the Trump campaign.[65] In the letter, Kushner wrote, \"In my opinion, accusations like 'racist' and 'anti-Semite' are being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless.\"[66] During the presidential transition, Kushner was said to be his father-in-law's \"confidant\",[67] and one of Donald Trump's closest advisors, even more so than Trump's four adult children.[68] Trump was reported to have requested the top-secret security clearance for him to attend the presidential daily intelligence briefings as his staff-level companion, along with General Mike Flynn, who already had the clearance prior to his resignation.[69] Kushner was reportedly an influential factor behind the firing of New Jersey governor Chris Christie as head of the transition team, as well as the dismissal from the Donald Trump transition team of anyone connected to Christie.[70][71] An anonymous source familiar with the transition told Politico, \"Jared doesn't like Christie... He's always held [the prosecution of his father] against Christie.\"[72] Kushner told Forbes that the reports that he was involved in Christie's dismissal were false: \"Six months ago, Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together... I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\"[73] On January 9, 2017, Kushner was named Senior Advisor to the President[74] (formally, \"Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor\"[75]). He consequently resigned as CEO of Kushner Companies, and as publisher of the Observer.[76] Kushner's appointment was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law.[77] On January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion stating, \"The President may appoint relatives to his immediate staff of advisors.\"[78][79] Kushner was sworn in on January 22, 2017.[80] Kushner operated on a temporary security clearance for more than a year,[81][82] with access to classified information, until he was granted permanent access in May 2018.[83] On February 27, 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly downgraded Kushner's interim security clearance to \"secret\" status, along with other White House staffers working with interim security clearances.[84][85][86] He worked in the White House based on an interim security clearance[87] until May 2018, when he passed a comprehensive background investigation.[88] The New York Times reported in February 2019 that in May 2018 Trump ordered Kelly to grant Kushner a top-secret clearance, which Kelly contemporaneously documented in an internal memo. Trump had asserted in January 2019 that he had no role in directing officials to grant Kushner the clearance.[89] Kushner's office is physically the closest to the Oval Office.[90] Trump put Kushner in charge of brokering peace in Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, as well as making deals with foreign countries, although in what way he is in charge is unclear.[91][92][93] On August 24, 2017, Kushner traveled to Israel to talk to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu[94] (with whom Kushner has longstanding personal links and family ties, causing Palestinians to distrust him[95][96]). He then traveled to Palestine to meet President Mahmoud Abbas in an attempt to restart a peace process in the Middle East.[94] Furthermore, after Donald Trump became President-elect, Kushner and his wife met with Japanese Prime Minister and other Japanese officials, while his wife was conducting a licensing deal between her namesake clothing brand and a Japanese government-owned company.[97] His wife sat in on a meeting between her father, then-president-elect Donald Trump, and Japan's prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.[98] In late March 2017, Jared Kushner was also given the new role of leading the \"White House Office of American Innovation\",[99][100] where Kushner reportedly has been focusing on improving governmental efforts with regard to Veterans Affairs, information-technology contracting, and the opioid crisis.[101] Kushner was involved in the sale of $100+ billion of arms to Saudi Arabia, and during a meeting with Saudi officials at the White House, he called Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson to ask for a lower price on a radar system to detect ballistic missiles.[102] Kushner's business activities in China have drawn scrutiny for mixing government with business.[103][104][105] Kushner's investments in real estate and financial services have also drawn controversy for conflicts of interest.[106][107] In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that he had failed to disclose all required financial information in his security clearance applications, including that he owes $1 billion in loans.[33][108] Abbe Lowell, the lawyer of Kushner, in a statement admitted that Kushner used private e-mail for official White House business. No classified or privileged information was used on this account. Kushner's father-in-law repeatedly criticized his opponent Hillary Clinton for her personal e-mail usage in her role as Secretary of State.[109] In an HBO/Axios interview released in June 2019, Kushner denied that President Trump was a racist. When asked whether birther conspiracy theories about President Obama (which Trump pushed extensively for a number of years) were racist, Kushner did not answer, saying instead twice, \"Look, I wasn\u2019t really involved in that.\"[110][111] In the interview, Kushner spoke about how great the United States was for accepting his grandparents as refugees, \"It's a great reminder of how great this country is.\"[111] In the same interview, he defended the Trump administration's decision to drastically reduce the number of refugees accepted by the United States (the lowest level in 40 years).[112] Kushner helped to spearhead creation of the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act (FIRST STEP ACT, H.R. 5682) and its endorsement by the House Judiciary Committee on May 9, 2018.[113][114][115] Kushner's contacts with Russian officials have come under scrutiny as part of the larger federal investigation into Russian interference in the election.[116] Kushner has said he had four meetings with Russians during the 2016 campaign and presidential transition, and that none of those Russian contacts were improper.[117] In June 2016, an agent of Emin Agalarov reportedly offered Donald Trump Jr., Kushner's brother-in-law, compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government if he met with a lawyer connected to the Kremlin.[118] A meeting took place on June 9, 2016, and included Kushner, Trump Jr., and Paul Manafort, who was then chairman of the presidential campaign, who met with Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower.[119] According to Rinat Akhmetshin, who was also present at the meeting, Veselnitskaya claimed to have evidence of \"violations of Russian law by a Democratic donor\", and that the \"Russian lawyer described her findings at the meeting and left a document about them with Trump Jr. and the others\".[120] The Democratic National Committee cyber attacks were revealed later that week.[118] Between April and November 2016, Kushner had two undisclosed phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak.[121] (In May 2017, Kushner's attorney Jamie Gorelick told Reuters that Kushner had participated in \"thousands of calls in this time period\" and did not recall any with Kislyak.[121]) In December 2016, Kushner met with Kislyak.[122] That month, U.S. intelligence officials who were monitoring Kislyak reportedly overheard him relaying to Moscow a request from Kushner to establish a \"secret and secure communications channel\" with the Kremlin using Russian diplomatic facilities. Kislyak reportedly was \"taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate \u2013 a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team\".[123][124] Also in December 2016, Kushner met with Sergey N. Gorkov, a trained Russian spy who then headed Vnesheconombank (VEB), a Russian state-owned bank.[122][125][126] Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Kushner met with Gorkov briefly as part of his role in the transition, and as a diplomatic conduit to the State Department.[127] However, VEB has stated that Gorkov met with Kushner on a private matter concerning his family's real estate corporation, Kushner Companies, even though VEB has been under international sanctions since July 2014.[128] In July 2017, Kushner appeared before both the House and Senate intelligence committees in closed session as part of their investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.[129] He also released a public statement.[130] In October 2017 the Senate Judiciary Committee requested numerous documents from Kushner. Kushner's attorneys gave the committee many documents on November 3, but the committee followed up on November 16 with a request for many additional documents it said had not been produced.[131] In early November 2017, Kushner was interviewed by investigators from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office. Reportedly the interview focused on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.[132] On December 1, Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI, as part of a plea bargain. Bloomberg reported that Kushner is most likely the \"senior member of the Trump transition team,\" mentioned in Flynn's plea documents, who is said to have ordered Flynn to contact Russia.[133] Mueller is investigating meetings between Trump associates including Kushner and George Nader, an emissary representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. In August 2016, Nader offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[134] In December 2016, Nader attended a New York meeting between the United Arab Emirates officials and Kushner, Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon.[135] Mueller is also investigating Kushner's possible ties to Qatar, Israel and China.[136] The transcript of Kushner's interview with FBI investigators was not publicly released in January 2020 as ordered by a federal judge, as the Justice Department stated it required a security review by an unnamed intelligence agency.[137] The transcript was released on February 3, redacted nearly in its entirety.[138][139] On January 18, 2017, Kushner requested Top Secret security clearance,[122] using \"Standard Form 86 (SF86): Questionnaire for National Security Positions\".[140][141] The request omitted dozens of pertinent contacts with foreign officials, including the meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov.[122] Failure to disclose pertinent contacts can cause security clearances to be declined or revoked, and an intentional failure to disclose can result in imprisonment.[142] Kushner's lawyers said that the omissions were \"an oversight\",[143] and that \"a member of [Kushner's] staff had prematurely hit the 'send' button\" before the form was completed.[140] By July 2017, Kushner had resubmitted his SF86, this time disclosing contacts with foreign nationals.[142] This was the first time that government officials were made aware of the June 2016 Trump campaign\u2013Russian meeting and Kushner's role in it.[142] On September 15, 2017, Carl Kline, the director of the personnel security office within the Executive Office of President Trump, recorded Kushner as having an interim Top Secret/SCI security clearance.[89] Kushner and his wife were among at least 48 officials granted interim clearance giving them access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI): detailed accounts of intelligence sources and methods.[144][145] In February 2018, all White House staff holding interim Top Secret/SCI security clearances, including Kushner, were downgraded to Secret clearances, and Trump said that he would not intervene to grant Kushner a permanent security clearance.[146] That day, White House sources said that part of the reason Kushner had not yet been granted permanent security clearance was that he was under investigation by Mueller.[147] On May 23, 2018, Kushner received permanent Top Secret security clearance.[148][149] In January 2019, Trump told the New York Times that he had not intervened to grant Kushner's security clearances.[89][150] On February 8, 2019, Kushner's wife Ivanka also denied that Trump had intervened to grant her or Kushner's security clearances.[150][151][152] However, on February 28, 2019, CNN (citing three anonymous sources) and The New York Times (citing four anonymous sources) reported that Trump had intervened to order the granting of those clearances.[89][150][153] Reportedly, this is the first time a U.S. President has intervened in such a way.[147] Kushner has a younger brother, Joshua, and two sisters, Dara and Nicole.[154] He married Ivanka Trump in a Jewish ceremony on October 25, 2009. They had met in 2005 through mutual friends.[155][156][157] Kushner and his wife (who converted to Judaism in 2009[158]) are Modern Orthodox Jews, keep a kosher home, and observe the Jewish Shabbat.[159][160][161] They have three children, a daughter born in July 2011[162] and two sons born in October 2013[163] and March 2016.[164] In 2017, federal disclosures suggested Kushner and his wife had assets worth at least $240 million, and as much as $740 million.[106][165] They also have an art collection, estimated to be worth millions that was not mentioned in the financial disclosures initially,[166] and enjoy visiting art studios.[167] The United States Office of Government Ethics has said that the updated disclosures comply with the regulations and laws.[168] When asked about his father-in-law President Donald Trump, Kushner told CNN's Van Jones: \"He's a black swan. He's been a black swan all his life.\"[169][ambiguous]",

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer Charles Kushner, the son of Jewish immigrants from the USSR, and is married to Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company Kushner Companies, which launched his business career. He later also bought Observer Media, publisher of the New York Observer. He is the co-founder and part owner of Cadre, an online real-estate investment platform.\nDuring the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, Kushner helped develop and run Trump's digital media strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor.\nKushner was born in Livingston, New Jersey, to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and Charles Kushner, a real-estate developer.[2] His paternal grandparents, Reichel and Joseph Kushner, were Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from Navahrudak, now in Belarus.[3][4] Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's maternal grandfather.[5]\nRaised in a Modern Orthodox Jewish family,[6] Kushner graduated from the Frisch School, a Modern Orthodox yeshiva high school, in 1999. He was an honors student and a member of the debate, hockey, and, basketball teams.[7]\nKushner enrolled at Harvard University in 1999. According to journalist Daniel Golden, Kushner was accepted due to his father's donations and history with the school.[8][9] He was elected into the Fly Club, supported the campus Chabad house,[10][11] and bought and sold real estate in Somerville, Massachusetts, as a vice president of Somerville Building Associates (a division of Kushner Companies), returning a profit of $20 million by its dissolution in 2005.[12][13][14] Kushner graduated from Harvard in 2003 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government.[15][16]\nKushner graduated from New York University in 2007 with dual JD/MBA degrees. He interned at Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office, and at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP.[17]\nFollowing his father's conviction for fraud in 2005 and subsequent incarceration, Jared Kushner took over the management of his father's real estate company.[18] As of 2019[update], Kushner's net worth is estimated at about $800 million.[19]\nKushner was a real-estate investor, and increased Kushner Companies' presence in the New York City real-estate market.[20]\nKushner Companies purchased the office building at 666 Fifth Avenue in 2007, for a then-record price of $1.8 billion, most of it borrowed.[21] He assumed the role of CEO in 2008.[22] Following the property crash that year, the cash flow generated by the property was insufficient to cover its debt service, and the Kushners were forced to sell the retail footage to Stanley Chera[23] and bring in Vornado Realty Trust as a 50% equity partner in the ownership of the building.[24] By that time, Kushner Companies had lost more than $90 million on its investment.[25] He was the face of the deal but his father Charles Kushner pushed him to do the deal.[26]\nOn August 18, 2014, Kushner acquired a three-building apartment portfolio in Middle River, Maryland, for $38 million with Aion Partners. In 2013\u20132014, he and his company acquired more than 11,000 units throughout New York, New Jersey, and the Baltimore area.[27] In May 2015, he purchased 50.1% of the Times Square Building from Africa Israel Investments Ltd. for $295 million.[28]\nIn 2014, Kushner, with his brother Joshua and Ryan Williams, co-founded Cadre (now RealCadre LLC), an online real-estate investment platform. His business partners included Goldman Sachs and billionaire George Soros, a top Democratic Party donor.[29][30][31] In early 2015, Soros Fund Management financed the startup with a $250 million credit line.[29][32] Kushner did not identify these business relationships in his January 2017 government financial-disclosure form.[29][33]\nIn 2006, Kushner purchased The New York Observer, a weekly New York City newspaper, for $10\u00a0million,[34] using money he says he earned during his college years by closing deals on residential buildings in Somerville, Massachusetts,[35] with family members providing the backing for his investments.[36]\nAfter purchasing the Observer, Kushner published it in tabloid format.[37] Since then, he has been credited with increasing the Observer's online presence and expanding the Observer Media Group.[38][39] With no substantial experience in journalism, Kushner could not establish a good relationship with the newspaper's veteran editor-in-chief, Peter W. Kaplan.[40] \"This guy doesn't know what he doesn't know\", Kaplan remarked about Kushner, to colleagues, at the time.[40] As a result of his differences with Kushner, Kaplan quit his position. Kaplan was followed by a series of short-lived successors until Kushner hired Elizabeth Spiers in 2011.[41] It has been alleged that Kushner used Observer as propaganda against rivals in real estate.[41][42] Spiers left the newspaper in 2012. In January 2013, Kushner hired a new editor-in-chief, Ken Kurson. Kurson had been a consultant to Republican political candidates in New Jersey.[41]\nAccording to Vanity Fair, under Kushner, the \"Observer has lost virtually all of its cultural currency among New York's elite, but the paper is now profitable and reporting traffic growth ... [it] boasts 6 million unique visitors per month, up from 1.3 million in January 2013\".[43] In April 2016, the New York Observer became one of only a handful of newspapers to officially endorse United States presidential candidate Donald Trump in the Republican primary, but the paper ended the campaign period by choosing not to back any presidential candidate at all.[44][45]\nKushner stepped down from his newspaper role in January 2017 to pursue a role in President Donald Trump's administration. He was replaced by his brother-in-law, Joseph Meyer.[46]\nJared Kushner had been a lifelong Democrat prior to his father-in-law Donald Trump entering politics.[47] He had donated over $10,000 to Democratic campaigns[48] starting at young age of 11. In 2008 he donated to the campaign for Hillary Clinton and his newspaper the New York Observer endorsed Barack Obama over John McCain in the US presidential election.[49] After expressing disappointment with Barack Obama, however, he endorsed Republican U.S. presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 via the New York Observer.[50] In 2014 he continued to donate to Democratic groups,[49] but he then continued his \"ideological conversion\" by joining his father-in-law Donald Trump's nascent US presidential campaign in the field of the Republican candidates in 2015.[55] Kushner had no prior involvement in campaign politics or in government before Trump's campaign.[56]\nFrom the outset of the presidential campaign of his father-in-law Donald Trump, Kushner was the architect of Trump's digital, online, and social media campaigns, enlisting talent from Silicon Valley to run a 100-person social-media team dubbed \"Project Alamo\".[57] Kushner, together with Paul Manafort and Brad Parscale, hired Steve Bannon's firm Cambridge Analytica to support the Trump campaign.[58] Kushner has also helped as a speechwriter, and was tasked with working to establish a plan for Trump's White House transition team.[59] He was for a time seen as Trump's de facto campaign manager, succeeding Corey Lewandowski, who was fired in part on Kushner's recommendation in June 2016.[60] He had been intimately involved with campaign strategy, coordinating Trump's visit in late August to Mexico, and he is believed to be responsible for the choice of Mike Pence as Trump's running mate.[57][61] Kushner's \"sprawling digital fundraising database and social media campaign\" has been described as \"the locus of his father-in-law's presidential bid\".[62]\nAccording to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt (who worked on technology for Hillary Clinton's campaign), Kushner's role in the 2016 election was its biggest surprise. Schmidt told Forbes, \"Best I can tell, he actually ran the campaign and did it with essentially no resources.\"[63] Federal Election Commission filings indicate the Trump campaign spent $343 million, about 59 percent as much as the Clinton campaign.[64]\nOn July 5, 2016, Kushner wrote an open letter in the New York Observer addressing the controversy around a tweet from the Trump campaign containing allegedly anti-Semitic imagery. He was responding to his own paper's editorial by Dana Schwartz criticizing Kushner's involvement with the Trump campaign.[65] In the letter, Kushner wrote, \"In my opinion, accusations like 'racist' and 'anti-Semite' are being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless.\"[66]\nDuring the presidential transition, Kushner was said to be his father-in-law's \"confidant\",[67] and one of Donald Trump's closest advisors, even more so than Trump's four adult children.[68] Trump was reported to have requested the top-secret security clearance for him to attend the presidential daily intelligence briefings as his staff-level companion, along with General Mike Flynn, who already had the clearance prior to his resignation.[69]\nKushner was reportedly an influential factor behind the firing of New Jersey governor Chris Christie as head of the transition team, as well as the dismissal from the Donald Trump transition team of anyone connected to Christie.[70][71] An anonymous source familiar with the transition told Politico, \"Jared doesn't like Christie... He's always held [the prosecution of his father] against Christie.\"[72] Kushner told Forbes that the reports that he was involved in Christie's dismissal were false: \"Six months ago, Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together... I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\"[73]\nOn January 9, 2017, Kushner was named Senior Advisor to the President[74] (formally, \"Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor\"[75]). He consequently resigned as CEO of Kushner Companies, and as publisher of the Observer.[76] Kushner's appointment was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law.[77] On January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion stating, \"The President may appoint relatives to his immediate staff of advisors.\"[78][79] Kushner was sworn in on January 22, 2017.[80] Kushner operated on a temporary security clearance for more than a year,[81][82] with access to classified information, until he was granted permanent access in May 2018.[83] On February 27, 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly downgraded Kushner's interim security clearance to \"secret\" status, along with other White House staffers working with interim security clearances.[84][85][86] He worked in the White House based on an interim security clearance[87] until May 2018, when he passed a comprehensive background investigation.[88] The New York Times reported in February 2019 that in May 2018 Trump ordered Kelly to grant Kushner a top-secret clearance, which Kelly contemporaneously documented in an internal memo. Trump had asserted in January 2019 that he had no role in directing officials to grant Kushner the clearance.[89] Kushner's office is physically the closest to the Oval Office.[90]\nTrump put Kushner in charge of brokering peace in Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, as well as making deals with foreign countries, although in what way he is in charge is unclear.[91][92][93] On August 24, 2017, Kushner traveled to Israel to talk to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu[94] (with whom Kushner has longstanding personal links and family ties, causing Palestinians to distrust him[95][96]). He then traveled to Palestine to meet President Mahmoud Abbas in an attempt to restart a peace process in the Middle East.[94]\nFurthermore, after Donald Trump became President-elect, Kushner and his wife met with Japanese Prime Minister and other Japanese officials, while his wife was conducting a licensing deal between her namesake clothing brand and a Japanese government-owned company.[97] His wife sat in on a meeting between her father, then-president-elect Donald Trump, and Japan's prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.[98]\nIn late March 2017, Jared Kushner was also given the new role of leading the \"White House Office of American Innovation\",[99][100] where Kushner reportedly has been focusing on improving governmental efforts with regard to Veterans Affairs, information-technology contracting, and the opioid crisis.[101] Kushner was involved in the sale of $100+ billion of arms to Saudi Arabia, and during a meeting with Saudi officials at the White House, he called Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson to ask for a lower price on a radar system to detect ballistic missiles.[102]\nKushner's business activities in China have drawn scrutiny for mixing government with business.[103][104][105]  Kushner's investments in real estate and financial services have also drawn controversy for conflicts of interest.[106][107] In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that he had failed to disclose all required financial information in his security clearance applications, including that he owes $1 billion in loans.[33][108]\nAbbe Lowell, the lawyer of Kushner, in a statement admitted that Kushner used private e-mail for official White House business. No classified or privileged information was used on this account. Kushner's father-in-law repeatedly criticized his opponent Hillary Clinton for her personal e-mail usage in her role as Secretary of State.[109]\n\nIn an HBO/Axios interview released in June 2019, Kushner denied that President Trump was a racist. When asked whether birther conspiracy theories about President Obama (which Trump pushed extensively for a number of years) were racist, Kushner did not answer, saying instead twice, \"Look, I wasn\u2019t really involved in that.\"[110][111] In the interview, Kushner spoke about how great the United States was for accepting his grandparents as refugees, \"It's a great reminder of how great this country is.\"[111] In the same interview, he defended the Trump administration's decision to drastically reduce the number of refugees accepted by the United States (the lowest level in 40 years).[112] Kushner helped to spearhead creation of the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act (FIRST STEP ACT, H.R. 5682) and its endorsement by the House Judiciary Committee on May 9, 2018.[113][114][115]\nKushner's contacts with Russian officials have come under scrutiny as part of the larger federal investigation into Russian interference in the election.[116] Kushner has said he had four meetings with Russians during the 2016 campaign and presidential transition, and that none of those Russian contacts were improper.[117]\nIn June 2016, an agent of Emin Agalarov reportedly offered Donald Trump Jr., Kushner's brother-in-law, compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government if he met with a lawyer connected to the Kremlin.[118] A meeting took place on June 9, 2016, and included Kushner, Trump Jr., and Paul Manafort, who was then chairman of the presidential campaign, who met with Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower.[119] According to Rinat Akhmetshin, who was also present at the meeting, Veselnitskaya claimed to have evidence of \"violations of Russian law by a Democratic donor\", and that the \"Russian lawyer described her findings at the meeting and left a document about them with Trump Jr. and the others\".[120] The Democratic National Committee cyber attacks were revealed later that week.[118]\nBetween April and November 2016, Kushner had two undisclosed phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak.[121] (In May 2017, Kushner's attorney Jamie Gorelick told Reuters that Kushner had participated in \"thousands of calls in this time period\" and did not recall any with Kislyak.[121]) In December 2016, Kushner met with Kislyak.[122] That month, U.S. intelligence officials who were monitoring Kislyak reportedly overheard him relaying to Moscow a request from Kushner to establish a \"secret and secure communications channel\" with the Kremlin using Russian diplomatic facilities. Kislyak reportedly was \"taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate \u2013 a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team\".[123][124]\nAlso in December 2016, Kushner met with Sergey N. Gorkov, a trained Russian spy who then headed Vnesheconombank (VEB), a Russian state-owned bank.[122][125][126] Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Kushner met with Gorkov briefly as part of his role in the transition, and as a diplomatic conduit to the State Department.[127] However, VEB has stated that Gorkov met with Kushner on a private matter concerning his family's real estate corporation, Kushner Companies, even though VEB has been under international sanctions since July 2014.[128]\nIn July 2017, Kushner appeared before both the House and Senate intelligence committees in closed session as part of their investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.[129] He also released a public statement.[130] In October 2017 the Senate Judiciary Committee requested numerous documents from Kushner. Kushner's attorneys gave the committee many documents on November 3, but the committee followed up on November 16 with a request for many additional documents it said had not been produced.[131]\nIn early November 2017, Kushner was interviewed by investigators from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office. Reportedly the interview focused on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.[132] On December 1, Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI, as part of a plea bargain. Bloomberg reported that Kushner is most likely the \"senior member of the Trump transition team,\" mentioned in Flynn's plea documents, who is said to have ordered Flynn to contact Russia.[133]\nMueller is investigating meetings between Trump associates including  Kushner and George Nader, an emissary representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. In August 2016,  Nader offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[134] In December 2016, Nader attended a New York meeting between the United Arab Emirates officials and Kushner, Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon.[135] Mueller is also investigating Kushner's possible ties to Qatar, Israel and China.[136]\nThe transcript of Kushner's interview with FBI investigators was not publicly released in January 2020 as ordered by a federal judge, as the Justice Department stated it required a security review by an unnamed intelligence agency.[137] The transcript was released on February 3, redacted nearly in its entirety.[138][139]\nOn January 18, 2017, Kushner requested Top Secret security clearance,[122] using \"Standard Form 86 (SF86): Questionnaire for National Security Positions\".[140][141]\nThe request omitted dozens of pertinent contacts with foreign officials, including the meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov.[122] Failure to disclose pertinent contacts can cause security clearances to be declined or revoked, and an intentional failure to disclose can result in imprisonment.[142] Kushner's lawyers said that the omissions were \"an oversight\",[143] and that \"a member of [Kushner's] staff had prematurely hit the 'send' button\" before the form was completed.[140]\nBy July 2017, Kushner had resubmitted his SF86, this time disclosing contacts with foreign nationals.[142] This was the first time that government officials were made aware of the June 2016 Trump campaign\u2013Russian meeting and Kushner's role in it.[142]\nOn September 15, 2017, Carl Kline, the director of the personnel security office within the Executive Office of President Trump, recorded Kushner as having an interim Top Secret/SCI security clearance.[89] Kushner and his wife were among at least 48 officials granted interim clearance giving them access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI): detailed accounts of intelligence sources and methods.[144][145]\nIn February 2018, all White House staff holding interim Top Secret/SCI security clearances, including Kushner, were downgraded to Secret clearances, and Trump said that he would not intervene to grant Kushner a permanent security clearance.[146] That day, White House sources said that part of the reason Kushner had not yet been granted permanent security clearance was that he was under investigation by Mueller.[147]\nOn May 23, 2018, Kushner received permanent Top Secret security clearance.[148][149]\nIn January 2019, Trump told the New York Times that he had not intervened to grant Kushner's security clearances.[89][150] On February 8, 2019, Kushner's wife Ivanka also denied that Trump had intervened to grant her or Kushner's security clearances.[150][151][152] However, on February 28, 2019, CNN (citing three anonymous sources) and The New York Times (citing four anonymous sources) reported that Trump had intervened to order the granting of those clearances.[89][150][153] Reportedly, this is the first time a U.S. President has intervened in such a way.[147]\nKushner has a younger brother, Joshua, and two sisters, Dara and Nicole.[154] He married Ivanka Trump in a Jewish ceremony on October 25, 2009. They had met in 2005 through mutual friends.[155][156][157] Kushner and his wife (who converted to Judaism in 2009[158]) are Modern Orthodox Jews, keep a kosher home, and observe the Jewish Shabbat.[159][160][161] They have three children, a daughter born in July 2011[162] and two sons born in October 2013[163] and March 2016.[164] In 2017, federal disclosures suggested Kushner and his wife had assets worth at least $240 million, and as much as $740 million.[106][165] They also have an art collection, estimated to be worth millions that was not mentioned in the financial disclosures initially,[166] and enjoy visiting art studios.[167] The United States Office of Government Ethics has said that the updated disclosures comply with the regulations and laws.[168]  When asked about his father-in-law President Donald Trump, Kushner told CNN's Van Jones: \"He's a black swan. He's been a black swan all his life.\"[169][ambiguous]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJames Brien Comey Jr. (/\u02c8ko\u028ami/; born December 14, 1960) is an American lawyer who was the 7th Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from 2013 until his dismissal in May 2017.[3] Comey had been a registered Republican for most of his adult life; in 2016, he described himself as unaffiliated.[4] Comey was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from January 2002 to December 2003, and the United States Deputy Attorney General from December 2003 to August 2005 in the administration of President George W. Bush. In August 2005, Comey left the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and became a senior vice president of Lockheed Martin as general counsel while based in Bethesda, Maryland.[5] In 2010, he became general counsel at Bridgewater Associates, based in Westport, Connecticut. In early 2013, he left Bridgewater to become a Senior Research Scholar and Hertog Fellow on National Security Law at Columbia Law School. He served on the board of directors of HSBC Holdings until July 2013.[6] In September 2013, President Barack Obama appointed Comey to the position of Director of the FBI.[7] In that capacity, he was responsible for overseeing the FBI's investigation of the Hillary Clinton email controversy. His role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was highly controversial.[8] Many Clinton supporters claim his decisions not long before the 2016 election might have cost her the presidency,[9] particularly his decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails less than two weeks before the election.[10][11][12] Comey also received heavy criticism from Republicans after it was revealed that he had begun drafting an exoneration letter for Clinton before the investigation was complete.[13] On June 14, 2018, DOJ Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz released his report on the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, which criticized Comey's actions during the 2016 election.[14] President Donald Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017.[15][16][17] Statements from Trump and the White House suggested that Comey had been fired to ease the \"pressure\" Trump was under due to the Russia investigation.[18][19][20] Later that month, Comey arranged for a friend to leak to the press a memo he had written after a February 14, 2017 private meeting with the president. It said Trump had asked him to end the FBI's investigation into Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor. The dismissal, various memos detailing meetings with Trump, and Comey's subsequent Congressional testimony in June that same year were interpreted by some commentators as evidence of obstruction of justice by the president and became part of the Mueller investigation.[21] Inspector General Horowitz found that Comey violated FBI policy regarding the memos, but the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Comey.[22] The New York Times and The Washington Post reported on November 22, 2019 that a forthcoming Horowitz report did not find Comey engaged in politically biased actions against Trump.[23][24] Comey was born on December 14, 1960, in Yonkers, New York, to parents Joan Marie Comey (n\u00e9e Herald)[25] and J. Brien Comey.[26] His grandfather, William J. Comey, was an officer and later commissioner of the Yonkers Police Department.[27] The family moved to Allendale, New Jersey, in the early 1970s.[28][29] His father worked in corporate real estate and his mother was a computer consultant and homemaker.[30] Comey is of Irish heritage.[31] He attended Northern Highlands Regional High School in Allendale;[32] in 1977 he and his brother were victims of a home invasion by a criminal called \"The Ramsey Rapist\".[33] Comey graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1982, majoring in chemistry and religion. His senior thesis analyzed the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and the televangelist Jerry Falwell, emphasizing their common belief in public action.[34] He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Chicago Law School in 1985.[35] After law school, Comey was a law clerk for United States District Judge John M. Walker Jr. in Manhattan. Then, he was an associate for Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in their New York office. He joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where he worked from 1987 to 1993. While there, he was Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division and helped prosecute the Gambino crime family.[36] From 1996 to 2001, Comey was Managing Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the Richmond Division of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.[12] In 1996, Comey acted as deputy special counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee.[37] He also was the lead prosecutor in the case concerning the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia.[38] While in Richmond, Comey was an Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of Richmond School of Law.[35] Comey was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, from January 2002 to the time of his confirmation as Deputy Attorney General on December 11, 2003.[35] Among his first tasks was to take over the investigation into President Bill Clinton's controversial pardon of Marc Rich.[37] In November 2002, he led the prosecution of three men involved in one of the largest identity fraud cases in American history.[39] The fraud had lasted two years and resulted in thousands of people across the country collectively losing over $3\u00a0million.[39] He also led the indictment of Adelphia Communications founder John Rigas for bank fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud. Rigas was convicted of the charges in 2004 and in 2005, was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. Adelphia Corporation was forced to file for bankruptcy after it acknowledged that it took $3.3\u00a0billion in false loans. It was \"one of the most elaborate and extensive corporate frauds in United States history\".[40][41][42][43] In February 2003, Comey was the lead prosecutor of Martha Stewart, who was indicted on the charges of securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and lying to an FBI agent.[12] She sold 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems, thereby avoiding a loss of $45,673. The next day, the Food and Drug Administration refused to accept the company's application for Erbitux.[44] In March 2003, he led the indictment of ImClone CEO Samuel Waksal, who pleaded guilty for avoiding paying $1.2\u00a0million in sales taxes on $15\u00a0million worth of contemporary paintings. The works were by Mark Rothko, Richard Serra, Roy Lichtenstein, and Willem de Kooning.[45] In April 2003, he led the indictment of Frank Quattrone, who allegedly urged subordinates in 2000 to destroy evidence sought by investigators looking into his investment banking practices at Credit Suisse First Boston.[46] In November 2003, he led the prosecutions in \"Operation Wooden Nickel\", which resulted in complaints and indictments against 47 people involved in foreign exchange trading scams.[47] Comey appointed Patrick Fitzgerald to be the Special Counsel to head the grand jury investigation into the Plame affair after Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself.[48] In early January 2006, The New York Times, as part of its investigation into the Bush administration's warrantless domestic surveillance program, reported on an incident in which Comey and other Justice Department officials refused to certify the legality of central aspects of the National Security Administration (NSA) program.[49] The DOJ had issued a finding that the domestic wiretapping under the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) was unconstitutional if such were done without a court warrant. Under White House procedures, Justice Department approval was required in order for the program to be renewed.[50] In early March 2004, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert S. Mueller III and Comey had prepared their resignations if the White House overruled the DOJ's finding that the program was unconstitutional.[51] On March 10, 2004, while the issue was still pending, United States Attorney General John Ashcroft was recovering in the intensive care unit at the George Washington University Hospital after gall bladder surgery. His wife was with him. He had recused himself from any Justice Department decisions while recovering, designating Comey as Acting Attorney General. In his hospital room he was visited by White House officials Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card, who pressured him to sign papers reauthorizing the domestic surveillance program. Alarmed by the situation, his wife called for Comey to join them, and he summoned FBI Director Mueller and two other DOJ officials, Jack Goldsmith and Patrick Philbin.[52] None of the four would agree to reauthorize the program, and Ashcroft refused to take any action while he was recused.[53][50] In Goldsmith's 2007 memoir, he said Comey had come to the hospital to support Ashcroft in withstanding pressure from the White House.[54] Comey later confirmed these events took place in testimony to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee on May 16, 2007.[55][56][57][58][59][60] FBI director Mueller's notes on the March 10, 2004, incident, which were released to a House Judiciary committee, confirms that he \"Saw (the) AG, John Ashcroft in the room (who was) feeble, barely articulate, clearly stressed.\"[61] Comey and Mueller cancelled their plans to resign after meeting on March 12, 2004, directly with President Bush, who directed that requisite changes be made to the surveillance program.[62] When Comey was Deputy Attorney General in 2005, he endorsed a memorandum that approved the use of 13 so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" that included waterboarding[49] and sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours (7\u00a01\u20442 days), which would be used by the CIA when interrogating suspects.[63][64] Comey objected to a second memorandum, drafted by Daniel Levin and signed by Steven G. Bradbury, which stated that these techniques could be used in combination.[63] Comey was one of the few members of the Bush administration who had tried to prevent or limit the use of torture.[65][66][67] During his 2013 confirmation hearing, Comey stated that in his personal opinion, waterboarding was torture,[68] the United Nations Convention against Torture was \"very vague\" and difficult to interpret as banning the practice.[54] Even though he believed the practice was legal at the time,[63] he strongly disagreed with the techniques and as a matter of policy, he opposed implementing them.[64][69] His objections were ultimately overruled by the National Security Council.[70] In the fall of 2005, Comey announced that he was leaving the Department of Justice.[71] In August 2005, it was announced that Comey would enter the private sector, becoming the General Counsel and Senior Vice President for Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Department of Defense's largest contractor.[72] Comey's tenure took effect on October 1, 2005,[73] serving in that capacity until June 2, 2010, when he announced he would leave Lockheed Martin to join the senior management committee at Bridgewater Associates, a Connecticut-based investment management firm.[74] Comey received a three million dollar payout from Bridgewater, his net worth estimated at 14 million dollars.[75][75] On February 1, 2013, after leaving Bridgewater, he was appointed by Columbia University Law School as a Senior Research Scholar and Hertog Fellow on National Security Law.[76] He was also appointed to the board of directors of the London-based financial institution HSBC Holdings,[77] to improve the company's compliance program after its $1.9\u00a0billion settlement with the Justice Department for failing to comply with basic due diligence requirements for money laundering regarding Mexican drug cartels and terrorism financing.[78][79] Since 2012, he has also served on the Defense Legal Policy Board.[80] In May 2007, Comey testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the House Judiciary subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law on the U.S. Attorney dismissal controversy.[71] His testimony contradicted that of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who had said the firings had been due to poor performance on the part of some of the dismissed prosecutors. Comey stressed that the Justice Department had to be perceived as nonpartisan and nonpolitical to function.[81] The Department of Justice, in my view, is run by political appointees of the President. The U.S. attorneys are political appointees of the President. But once they take those jobs and run this institution, it's very important in my view for that institution to be another in American life, that\u2014because my people had to stand up before juries of all stripes, talk to sheriffs of all stripes, judges of all stripes. They had to be seen as the good guys, and not as either this administration or that administration.[81] Politico reported in May 2009, White House officials pushed for Comey's inclusion on the short list of names to replace Associate Justice David Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court.[82] Politico later reported liberal activists were upset about the possibility of Comey's name being included. John Brittain of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law stated, \"[Comey] came in with the Bushies. What makes you think he'd be just an inch or two more to the center than [John] Roberts? I'd be greatly disappointed.\"[83] In 2013, Comey was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[84] The May 2013 reports became official the following month when President Barack Obama revealed that he would nominate Comey to be the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, replacing outgoing director Robert Mueller.[85][86] Comey was reportedly chosen over another finalist, Lisa Monaco, who had overseen national security issues at the Justice Department during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012.[87][88] On July 29, 2013, the Senate confirmed Comey to a full ten-year term as FBI Director. He was confirmed by a vote of 93\u20131. Two senators voted present.[89] He was sworn in as FBI director on September 4, 2013.[90] Comey was dismissed by President Donald Trump on May 9, 2017.[15] In February 2015, Comey delivered a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., regarding the relationship between police and the African American community.[91][92] He said that, \"At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo \u2013 a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups,\" mentioning as an example his own Irish ancestors, who he said had, in the early 20th century, often been regarded by law enforcement as drunks and criminals. He added, \"The Irish had some tough times, but little compares to the experience on our soil of black Americans,\" going on to highlight current societal issues such as lack of opportunities for employment and education which can lead young black men to crime.[91] Comey stated:Police officers on patrol in our nation's cities often work in environments where a hugely disproportionate percentage of street crime is committed by young men of color. Something happens to people of good will working in that environment. After years of police work, officers often can't help be influenced by the cynicism they feel. A mental shortcut becomes almost irresistible.[91]In October 2015, Comey gave a speech in which he raised concerns that body worn video results in less effective policing; this opinion contradicted the President's public position.[93] Days later, President Obama met with Comey in the Oval Office to address the issue.[94] In an October 23 speech at the University of Chicago Law School, Comey said:I remember being asked why we were doing so much prosecuting in black neighborhoods and locking up so many black men. After all, Richmond was surrounded by areas with largely white populations. Surely there were drug dealers in the suburbs. My answer was simple: We are there in those neighborhoods because that's where people are dying. These are the guys we lock up because they are the predators choking off the life of a community. We did this work because we believed that all lives matter, especially the most vulnerable.[95]In April 2015, Comey spoke at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, arguing in favor of more Holocaust education.[96] After The Washington Post printed a version of his speech, Anne Applebaum wrote that his reference to \"the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary\" was inaccurately saying that Poles were as responsible for the Holocaust as Germans.[97] His speech was also criticized by Polish authorities, and Stephen D. Mull, United States Ambassador to Poland, was called to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[98] Applebaum wrote that Comey, \"in a speech that was reprinted in The Post arguing for more Holocaust education, demonstrated just how badly he needs it himself\".[99] Ambassador Mull issued an apology for Comey's remarks.[100] When asked about his remarks, Comey said, \"I regret linking Germany and Poland ... The Polish state bears no responsibility for the horrors imposed by the Nazis. I wish I had not used any other country names because my point was a universal one about human nature.\"[101] In June 2015, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people.[102] Later, Comey put the number at 18 million.[103] The Washington Post has reported that the attack originated in China, citing unnamed government officials.[104] Comey said: \"It is a very big deal from a national security perspective and from a counterintelligence perspective. It's a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for, or works for the United States government.\"[105] On July 10, 2015, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State.[8] On June 29, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton met aboard her plane on the tarmac of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, leading to calls for her recusal. Lynch then announced that she would \"fully\" accept the recommendation of the FBI regarding the probe.[8] On July 2, FBI agents completed their investigation by interviewing Hillary Clinton at FBI headquarters, following which Comey and his associates decided there was no basis for criminal indictments in the case.[8] On July 5, 2016, Comey announced the FBI's recommendation that the United States Department of Justice file no criminal charges relating to the Hillary Clinton email controversy.[106] During a 15-minute press conference in the J. Edgar Hoover Building, Comey called Secretary Clinton's and her top aides' behavior \"extremely careless\", but concluded that \"no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\". It was believed to be the first time the FBI disclosed its prosecutorial recommendation to the Department of Justice publicly.[106] On July 7, 2016, Comey was questioned by a Republican-led House committee during a hearing regarding the FBI's recommendation.[107][108] On October 26, 2016, two weeks before the presidential election, Comey learned that FBI agents investigating an unrelated case involving former Congressman Anthony Weiner had discovered emails on Weiner's computer between his wife, Huma Abedin, and Hillary Clinton. Claiming he believed it would take months to review Weiner's emails, Comey decided he had to inform Congress that the investigation was being reopened due to new information.[8] Justice Department lawyers warned him that giving out public information about an investigation was inconsistent with department policy, but he considered the policy to be \"guidance\" rather than an ironclad rule.[109] He decided that to not reveal the new information would be misleading to Congress and the public.[110] On October 28, Comey sent a letter to members of Congress advising them that the FBI was reviewing more emails. Members of Congress revealed the information to the public within minutes.[111] Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as the Clinton and Trump campaigns, called on Comey to provide additional details. The Clinton campaign and numerous former officials and other commentators criticized his decision to announce the reopened investigation.[112][113][114][115][116] Law professor Richard Painter filed complaints with the United States Office of Special Counsel and the United States Office of Government Ethics over Comey's letter to Congress.[117] The investigators received additional resources so they could complete their review of the new emails before Election Day,[8] and on November 6, 2016, Comey wrote in a second letter to Congress that \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July\".[118] Comey was broadly criticized for his actions from both the right and the left.[119][120][121][122] According to the Clinton campaign, the letters effectively stopped the campaign's momentum by hurting Clinton's chances with voters who were receptive to Trump's claims of a \"rigged system\".[123] Polling authority Nate Silver commented on Twitter that Comey had a \"large, measurable impact on the race.\"[124][125][10] Other analysts, such as Democratic strategist David Axelrod, said that Comey's public actions were just one of several cumulative factors that cost Clinton the election.[126][127] On May 2, 2017, Hillary Clinton told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\"[128] On May 3, 2017, Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that it \"makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election,\" but that \"honestly, it wouldn't change the decision.\"[129][130] On January 12, 2017, the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General announced a formal investigation into whether the FBI followed proper procedures in its investigation of Clinton or whether \"improper considerations\" were made by FBI personnel.[131] On July 27, 2017, the House Judiciary Committee decided to request documents related to Comey, including the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton, Comey's conduct during the 2016 election, and his release of his memo to the press.[132][133] The committee's Republicans also wrote a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to appoint a second special prosecutor to investigate these issues.[134] In September 2017, two Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), alleged that Comey planned to exonerate Hillary Clinton in her email scandal long before the agency had completed its investigation.[135] The story was confirmed by the FBI in October, which released a Comey memo dated May 2. Comey interviewed Clinton as part of his investigation on July 2. Former FBI official Ron Hosko reacted saying, \"You tend to reach final conclusions as the investigation is logically ended. Not months before.\" Donald Trump called it \"disgraceful.\" In contrast, former Department of Justice spokesman Matthew Miller wrote on Twitter, \"The decision is never 'made' until the end, even when there's a 99% chance it is only going to go one way.\"[13] Comey's original draft of the exoneration stated that Clinton had committed \"gross negligence,\" which is a crime. However, the language was later changed to \"extreme carelessness.\"[136] In December, it was revealed that the change had been made by Peter Strzok, an FBI official who would later join Mueller's probe and be dismissed after exchanging private messages with an FBI lawyer that could be seen as favoring Clinton politically.[137] On June 14, 2018, Inspector General Michael Horowitz issued his report criticizing Comey's handling of the Clinton email probe as \"insubordinate\".[138] Specifically, he stated that Comey made \"a serious error in judgment\", \"usurped the authority of the Attorney General,\" \"chose to deviate\" from established procedures, and engaged \"in his own subjective, ad hoc decision making\" by publicly announcing that he wouldn't recommend any charges in the Clinton email investigation in July 2016 and later by sending a letter to Congress about reopening the case.[139] The report found no evidence of political bias, although other high-ranking FBI officials showed \"willingness to take official action\" to negatively impact the Trump campaign.[14] On July 5, 2016, the day of Comey's press conference, the FBI acquired the Donald Trump-Russia dossier by Christopher Steele.[8] In late July, the FBI opened an investigation into the Trump campaign.[8] Comey asked President Obama for permission to write an op-ed, which would warn the public that the Russians were interfering in the election. The President denied the request.[8] CIA Director John O. Brennan then gave an unusual private briefing on the Russians to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid; Reid then publicly referred to the briefing.[8] Comey, however, refused to confirm\u2014even in classified Congressional briefings\u2014that the Trump Campaign was under investigation.[8] In early October, meetings were held in the White House Situation Room; National Security Advisor Susan Rice argued that the information should be released, while Comey argued that disclosure was no longer needed.[8] In January 2017, Comey first met Trump when he briefed the President-elect on the Steele dossier.[140] On January 27, 2017, Trump and Comey dined alone at the White House.[140] According to Trump, Comey requested the dinner so as to ask to keep his job and, when asked, told Trump that he was not under investigation. Trump has stated that he did not ask Comey to pledge his loyalty. However, according to Comey's associates, Trump requested the dinner, asked Comey to pledge his loyalty, twice, to which Comey replied, twice, that he would always be honest, until Trump asked him if he would promise \"honest loyalty\", which Comey did.[140] On February 14, the day after President Trump fired Michael T. Flynn, Comey met with the President during a terrorism threat briefing in the Oval Office.[141] At the end of the meeting Trump asked the other security chiefs to leave, then told Comey to consider imprisoning reporters over leaks and that \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\"[141] Comey, as is usual, immediately documented the meeting in a memo and shared it with FBI officials.[141] In his Congressional testimony, Comey clarified that he took Trump's comment to be \"an order\" to drop the Flynn investigation, but \"that he did not consider this an order to drop the Russia investigation as a whole.\"[142] On March 4, Comey asked the Justice Department for permission, which was not given, to publicly refute Trump's claim that his phones had been wiretapped by then-President Obama.[143] On March 20, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Comey confirmed that the FBI has been investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether any crimes were committed.[144] During the hearing, the White House Twitter account posted \"The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process,\" which Comey, when he was read the tweet by Congressman Jim Himes, directly refuted.[145] Comey also refuted the President's Trump Tower wiretapping allegations, testifying \"I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI.\"[146] U.S. Representative Chris Stewart (R-UT) asked Comey in the hearing: \"Mr. Clapper then went on to say that to his knowledge there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. We did not conclude any evidence in our report and when I say 'our report,' that is the NSA, FBI, and CIA with my office, the director of national intelligence said anything \u2013 any reflection of collusion between the members of Trump campaign and the Russians, there was no evidence of that in our report. Was Mr. Clapper wrong when he said that?\" Comey responded: \"I think he's right about characterizing the report which you all have read.\"[147] Press Secretary Sean Spicer and a White House tweet then highlighted this testimony as proof that Clapper was \"right\" there was no evidence of collusion, causing Clapper to release a statement clarifying he had been referring to the evidence as gathered in January and that more investigation is needed.[145] On May 3, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said that Russia is the \"greatest threat of any nation on Earth ... One of the biggest lessons learned is that Russia will do this again. Because of 2016 election, they know it worked.\"[148] He also said that Russia should pay a price for interfering.[149] In early May, a few days before he was fired, Comey reportedly asked the Justice Department for a significant increase in funding and personnel for the Russia probe.[16] On May 11, 2017, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he was unaware of the request and stated, \"I believe we have the adequate resources to do it and I know that we have resourced that investigation adequately.\"[150][151] Comey had been scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on May 11, but after he was dismissed on May 9, committee chair Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) said that Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe would appear instead.[152] Comey spoke before the Committee on June 8.[153][154] His prepared opening statements were pre-released by the Intelligence Committee on their website one day before the official hearings.[155][156][157] In his July 2013 FBI confirmation hearing, Comey said that the oversight mechanisms of the U.S. government have sufficient privacy protections.[158] In a November 2014 New York Times Magazine article, Yale historian Beverly Gage reported that Comey keeps on his desk a copy of the FBI request to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. \"as a reminder of the bureau's capacity to do wrong\".[159] In 2016, Comey and his agency were criticized for their request to Apple Inc. to install a \"back door\" for U.S. surveillance agencies to use. Former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden stated: \"Jim would like a back door available to American law enforcement in all devices globally. And, frankly, I think on balance that actually harms American safety and security, even though it might make Jim's job a bit easier in some specific circumstances.\"[160] Comey, speaking at a cybersecurity conference in 2017, told the audience, \"There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America; there is no place outside of judicial reach.\"[161] President Trump formally dismissed Comey on May 9, 2017, less than 4 years into his 10-year term as Director of the FBI. Comey first learned of his termination from television news reports that flashed on screen while he was delivering a speech to agents at the Los Angeles Field Office.[162] Sources said he was surprised and caught off guard by the termination. Comey immediately departed for Washington, D.C., and was forced to cancel his scheduled speech that night at an FBI recruitment event.[163] Trump reportedly called Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the next day, demanding to know why Comey had been allowed to fly back to Washington on an FBI jet after he had been fired.[164] On May 10, Comey sent a letter to FBI staff in which he said, \"I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.\"[165] In the absence of a Senate-confirmed FBI director, McCabe automatically became Acting Director.[166] The White House initially stated the firing was on the recommendation of United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to both of whom Comey reported.[167] Rosenstein had sent a memorandum to Sessions, forwarded to Trump, in which Rosenstein listed objections to Comey's conduct in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.[168] It allowed the Trump administration to attribute Comey's firing to Rosenstein's recommendation about the Clinton email controversy. It was later revealed that on May 8, Trump had requested Sessions and Rosenstein to detail in writing a case against Comey.[169][170] Rosenstein's memo was forwarded to Trump on May 9 and was then construed as a recommendation to dismiss Comey, which Trump immediately did. In Trump's termination letter to Comey, he attributed the firing to the respective letters from Sessions and Rosenstein.[171][172] On May 10, Trump told reporters he had fired Comey because Comey \"wasn't doing a good job.\"[173] White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders added that the FBI rank and file had lost faith in Comey and that she had \"heard from countless members of the FBI ... grateful and thankful for the president's decision.\"[174] By May 11, however, in a direct contradiction of the earlier statements by the White House, Vice President Mike Pence, and the contents of the dismissal letter itself, President Trump stated to Lester Holt in an NBC News interview that Comey's dismissal was in fact \"my decision\" and \"I was going to fire [Comey] regardless of recommendation [by Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein].\"[175][176] Trump later said of the dismissal \"when I decided to just do it [fire Comey], I said to myself, I said 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'\"[177] In the same televised interview, Trump labelled Comey \"a showboat\" and \"grandstander\". On May 19, the New York Times published excerpts of an official White House document summarizing Trump's private meeting, the day after the firing, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the Russian Ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, in the Oval Office. Trump told Kislyak and Lavrov that he \"just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job.\" Trump added: \"I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off\", further adding \"I'm not under investigation.\"[20][178][179][180] According to reports, Trump had been openly talking to aides about finding a reason to fire Comey for at least a week before both the dismissal and the request of memoranda from Sessions and Rosenstein the day prior. Trump was angry and frustrated when, in the week prior to his dismissal, Comey revealed in Senate testimony the breadth of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia's effort to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He felt Comey was giving too much attention to the Russia probe and not enough to internal leaks to the press from within the government.[172][181] Shortly before Comey was fired, he had requested additional money and resources to further expand the probe into Russian interference into the Presidential election.[16] Trump had long questioned Comey's loyalty to him personally and Comey's judgment to act accordingly.[171] Moreover, Trump was angry that Comey would not support his claim that President Barack Obama had his campaign offices wiretapped.[181][182] On May 16, 2017, it was first reported that Comey had prepared a detailed set of notes following every meeting and telephone call he had with President Trump.[183][184] On May 12, Trump tweeted \"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\",[185] which the media, political and legal analysts, as well as opposition politicians, interpreted as a threat to Comey.[186] On June 8, when asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee about the existence of tapes, Comey replied \"Lordy, I hope there are tapes!\" He added that he would have no problem with the public release of any recordings.[187] On June 22, after the House Judiciary committee threatened the White House with a potential subpoena for the alleged tapes, Trump issued a tweet stating \"I have no idea [...] whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.\"[188] Hours later, when asked to clarify the non-denial denial wording of Trump's tweet regarding the tapes, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Trump's tweet was \"extremely clear\" and that she did \"not have anything to add.\"[189] Questions raised for clarification on Trump's tweet centered principally around whether Trump ever had knowledge of said tapes having ever existed and whether he is simply no longer privy to the knowledge of whether said tapes still exist; whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump having made said tapes or recordings; and whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump currently having or previously having had in their possession said tapes or recordings. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), stated that Trump's tweet \"raises as many questions as it answers,\" and that in any event, the tweet did not comply with the June 23 deadline, and that Schiff would move forward with subpoenas for the tapes, adding that \"[r]egardless of whether the President intends his tweets to be an official reply to the House Intelligence Committee, the White House must respond in writing to our committee as to whether any tapes or recordings exist.\"[190] On October 4, 2019, allegations of a possible White House recording system resurfaced after House Democrats, who have controlled US House of Representative since the 2018 election, issued a subpoena for White House documents, including any possible audio tapes,[191] following the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal, setting the stage for a legal battle which could go as far as the US Supreme Court.[192] Comey's termination was immediately controversial. It was compared to the Saturday Night massacre, President Richard Nixon's termination of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had been investigating the Watergate scandal,[193][194] and to the firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates in January 2017. Many members of Congress expressed concern over the firing and argued that it would put the integrity of the investigation into jeopardy.[195] Critics accused Trump of obstruction of justice.[196] In the dismissal letter, Trump stated that Comey had told him \"on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation.\"[197] Fact checkers reported that while they had no way of knowing what Comey may have told Trump privately, no such assertion was on the public record at that time of Comey directly stating that Trump was not personally under investigation.[198] However, in later Congressional testimony, Comey confirmed that on three occasions he volunteered to Trump that the latter was not personally under FBI investigation.[199][200] According to Comey associates interviewed by news organizations, Trump had asked Comey in January to pledge loyalty to him, to which Comey demurred, instead offering him \"honesty\".[140][201] Comey indicated he was willing to testify about his dismissal but only in an open hearing.[202] He declined an invitation from the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify before a closed-door session.[202] On May 11, Acting Director McCabe testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that \"Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does\" and that \"the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey\". This contradicted White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said she had heard from \"countless\" FBI agents in support of the firing.[203] On May 16, The New York Times revealed the existence of a memo Comey had written after a February 14 meeting with Trump. It said that Trump had asked him to drop the FBI's investigation into Mike Flynn, who had been fired as National Security Advisor the day before.[204] Comey later explained that he had arranged, through a friend, for the memo to be shared with the press in hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.[205] On June 8, 2017, Comey gave public testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee about his firing. When asked why thought he had been fired, he said he had been confused by the shifting explanations for it but that \"I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation.\"[206] He said that he had made contemporaneous notes about several of his conversations with the president because \"I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting so I felt the need to document it.\"[206] He said he had not done so with the two previous presidents he had served.[citation needed] On April 19, 2018, the Justice Department released 15 pages of documents to Congress which comprise partially declassified memos that Comey made after his meetings with Trump. The memos were released by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd in both a classified and unclassified versions. The unclassified version was obtained by Mary Clare Jalonick of the Associated Press on April 19 and published the next day.[207][208] In June 2018, DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had received a referral from the FBI regarding Comey's release of his Trump meeting memos to Daniel Richman, parts of which were classified \"confidential\" after the fact.[209] The DOJ decided in July 2019 to not prosecute Comey, with Fox News quoting one official saying, \"Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn't a close call. They all thought this could not be prosecuted.\"[210] In a second report released August 29, 2019, IG Horowitz found that Comey violated agency policies when he retained a set of memos he wrote documenting meetings with President Donald Trump early in 2017, and caused one of them to be leaked to the press.[22][211] Though Comey is said by the report to have set a \"dangerous example\" for FBI employees in an attempt to \"achieve a personally desired outcome,\" the Inspector General has found \"no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media\", and the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Comey.[22] Macmillan Publishers' Flatiron Books announced in August 2017 that it had acquired the rights to Comey's first book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership, in which he discusses ethics, leadership, and his experience in government.[212] Several publishers had submitted bids in an auction conducted by literary agency Javelin.[213][214][215] The release date was moved up from May 1, 2018 to April 17, 2018, due to scrutiny faced by the FBI during the Special Counsel investigation.[216] A month before the book was released, presale orders made it the top seller on Amazon.[217] The boom was attributed to a series of Twitter attacks on Comey by Trump, in which Trump claimed that Comey \"knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\"[218] In response, Comey tweeted, \"Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"[217] Comey's autobiography was well-received, with The New York Times calling it \"very persuasive\" and describing the book as \"absorbing\" in its book review,[219] stating \"Comey's memoir offers visceral details on a president untethered to truth.\"[220] Comey confirmed that the Twitter account @projectexile7 (later changed to @formerbu), which uses \"Reinhold Niebuhr\" as its display name, is operated by him.[221] Additionally, Comey has written the foreword for a forthcoming biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt entitled A Christian and a Democrat: A Religious Biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt published by William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.[222] In the summer of 2017, Comey gave the convocation speech and a series of lectures at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. During the fall of 2018, Comey will return to his alma mater, the College of William & Mary, to teach a course on ethical leadership. He will be an executive professor in education, a nontenured position at the College. Comey will join assistant professor Drew Stelljes to teach the course during the 2018\u20132019 academic year.[223] In February 2019, in the midst of controversy surrounding a blackface picture in new Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook, and a national debate about the Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, Comey published an op ed in the Washington Post, suggesting that Virginia should get rid of the Confederate statues in Richmond: \"Expressing bipartisan horror at blackface photos is essential, but removing the statues would show all of America that Virginia really has changed.\"[224] On May 1, 2019, in an opinion published by The New York Times, as Attorney General William Barr was scheduled to be questioned in congressional hearings, Comey asserted that \"[a]ccomplished people lacking inner strength can't resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from. It takes character like Mr. Mattis's to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.\"[225] He concluded with, \"Of course, to stay, you must be seen as on his team, so you make further compromises. You use his language, praise his leadership, tout his commitment to values. And then you are lost. He has eaten your soul.\"[226] Comey was a registered Republican for most of his life. He donated to Senator John McCain's campaign in the 2008 presidential election and to Governor Mitt Romney's campaign in the 2012 presidential election.[227] He disclosed during Congressional testimony on July 7, 2016, that he was no longer registered with any party.[1] In an interview with ABC News on April 18, 2018, Comey said that the \"Republican Party [had] left [him] and many others,\" and that \"these people don't represent anything [he believes] in.\"[2] On July 18, 2018, Comey urged voters to vote for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections through Twitter. He wrote, \"This Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the Founders' design that 'Ambition must ... counteract ambition.' All who believe in this country's values must vote for Democrats this fall. Policy differences don't matter right now. History has its eyes on us.\"[228] He was donating to and canvassing votes for Democratic candidate Jennifer Wexton in those elections.[229] Comey is of Irish descent and was raised in a Roman Catholic household[28][230] but now belongs to the United Methodist Church, where he has taught Sunday school.[231] He is 6\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (2.03\u00a0m) tall.[232] Comey and his wife, Patrice Failor, are the parents of five children,[231] and a son who died in infancy. He has said that he learned to make something good happen after a tragedy.[233][234] They have also been foster parents.[235] Their oldest daughter, Maurene, graduated from Harvard Law School in 2013 and the following year received a clerkship in U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.[236] In 2015 she became Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and while still serving in this role was named a lead prosecutor in the office's case against Jeffery Epstein.[236]",

In early 2013, he left Bridgewater to become a Senior Research Scholar and Hertog Fellow on National Security Law at Columbia Law School. He served on the board of directors of HSBC Holdings until July 2013.[6]\nIn September 2013, President Barack Obama appointed Comey to the position of Director of the FBI.[7] In that capacity, he was responsible for overseeing the FBI's investigation of the Hillary Clinton email controversy. His role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was highly controversial.[8] Many Clinton supporters claim his decisions not long before the 2016 election might have cost her the presidency,[9] particularly his decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails less than two weeks before the election.[10][11][12] Comey also received heavy criticism from Republicans after it was revealed that he had begun drafting an exoneration letter for Clinton before the investigation was complete.[13] On June 14, 2018, DOJ Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz released his report on the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, which criticized Comey's actions during the 2016 election.[14]\nPresident Donald Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017.[15][16][17] Statements from Trump and the White House suggested that Comey had been fired to ease the \"pressure\" Trump was under due to the Russia investigation.[18][19][20] Later that month, Comey arranged for a friend to leak to the press a memo he had written after a February 14, 2017 private meeting with the president. It said Trump had asked him to end the FBI's investigation into Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor. The dismissal, various memos detailing meetings with Trump, and Comey's subsequent Congressional testimony in June that same year were interpreted by some commentators as evidence of obstruction of justice by the president and became part of the Mueller investigation.[21] Inspector General Horowitz found that Comey violated FBI policy regarding the memos, but the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Comey.[22] The New York Times and The Washington Post reported on November 22, 2019 that a forthcoming Horowitz report did not find Comey engaged in politically biased actions against Trump.[23][24]\nComey was born on December 14, 1960, in Yonkers, New York, to parents Joan Marie Comey (n\u00e9e Herald)[25] and J. Brien Comey.[26] His grandfather, William J. Comey, was an officer and later commissioner of the Yonkers Police Department.[27] The family moved to Allendale, New Jersey, in the early 1970s.[28][29] His father worked in corporate real estate and his mother was a computer consultant and homemaker.[30] Comey is of Irish heritage.[31] He attended Northern Highlands Regional High School in Allendale;[32] in 1977 he and his brother were victims of a home invasion by a criminal called \"The Ramsey Rapist\".[33] Comey graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1982, majoring in chemistry and religion. His senior thesis analyzed the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and the televangelist Jerry Falwell, emphasizing their common belief in public action.[34] He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Chicago Law School in 1985.[35]\nAfter law school, Comey was a law clerk for United States District Judge John M. Walker Jr. in Manhattan. Then, he was an associate for Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher in their New York office. He joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where he worked from 1987 to 1993. While there, he was Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division and helped prosecute the Gambino crime family.[36]\nFrom 1996 to 2001, Comey was Managing Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the Richmond Division of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.[12] In 1996, Comey acted as deputy special counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee.[37] He also was the lead prosecutor in the case concerning the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia.[38] While in Richmond, Comey was an Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of Richmond School of Law.[35]\nComey was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, from January 2002 to the time of his confirmation as Deputy Attorney General on December 11, 2003.[35] Among his first tasks was to take over the investigation into President Bill Clinton's controversial pardon of Marc Rich.[37] In November 2002, he led the prosecution of three men involved in one of the largest identity fraud cases in American history.[39] The fraud had lasted two years and resulted in thousands of people across the country collectively losing over $3\u00a0million.[39] He also led the indictment of Adelphia Communications founder John Rigas for bank fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud. Rigas was convicted of the charges in 2004 and in 2005, was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. Adelphia Corporation was forced to file for bankruptcy after it acknowledged that it took $3.3\u00a0billion in false loans. It was \"one of the most elaborate and extensive corporate frauds in United States history\".[40][41][42][43]\nIn February 2003, Comey was the lead prosecutor of Martha Stewart, who was indicted on the charges of securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and lying to an FBI agent.[12] She sold 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems, thereby avoiding a loss of $45,673. The next day, the Food and Drug Administration refused to accept the company's application for Erbitux.[44] In March 2003, he led the indictment of ImClone CEO Samuel Waksal, who pleaded guilty for avoiding paying $1.2\u00a0million in sales taxes on $15\u00a0million worth of contemporary paintings. The works were by Mark Rothko, Richard Serra, Roy Lichtenstein, and Willem de Kooning.[45] In April 2003, he led the indictment of Frank Quattrone, who allegedly urged subordinates in 2000 to destroy evidence sought by investigators looking into his investment banking practices at Credit Suisse First Boston.[46] In November 2003, he led the prosecutions in \"Operation Wooden Nickel\", which resulted in complaints and indictments against 47 people involved in foreign exchange trading scams.[47]\nComey appointed Patrick Fitzgerald to be the Special Counsel to head the grand jury investigation into the Plame affair after Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself.[48]\nIn early January 2006, The New York Times, as part of its investigation into the Bush administration's warrantless domestic surveillance program, reported on an incident in which Comey and other Justice Department officials refused to certify the legality of central aspects of the National Security Administration (NSA) program.[49] The DOJ had issued a finding that the domestic wiretapping under the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) was unconstitutional if such were done without a court warrant. Under White House procedures, Justice Department approval was required in order for the program to be renewed.[50] In early March 2004, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert S. Mueller III and Comey had prepared their resignations if the White House overruled the DOJ's finding that the program was unconstitutional.[51]\nOn March 10, 2004, while the issue was still pending, United States Attorney General John Ashcroft was recovering in the intensive care unit at the George Washington University Hospital after gall bladder surgery. His wife was with him. He had recused himself from any Justice Department decisions while recovering, designating Comey as Acting Attorney General. In his hospital room he was visited by White House officials Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card, who pressured him to sign papers reauthorizing the domestic surveillance program. Alarmed by the situation, his wife called for Comey to join them, and he summoned FBI Director Mueller and two other DOJ officials, Jack Goldsmith and Patrick Philbin.[52] None of the four would agree to reauthorize the program, and Ashcroft refused to take any action while he was recused.[53][50] In Goldsmith's 2007 memoir, he said Comey had come to the hospital to support Ashcroft in withstanding pressure from the White House.[54] Comey later confirmed these events took place in testimony to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee on May 16, 2007.[55][56][57][58][59][60] FBI director Mueller's notes on the March 10, 2004, incident, which were released to a House Judiciary committee, confirms that he \"Saw (the) AG, John Ashcroft in the room (who was) feeble, barely articulate, clearly stressed.\"[61]\nComey and Mueller cancelled their plans to resign after meeting on March 12, 2004, directly with President Bush, who directed that requisite changes be made to the surveillance program.[62]\nWhen Comey was Deputy Attorney General in 2005, he endorsed a memorandum that approved the use of 13 so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" that included waterboarding[49] and sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours (7\u00a01\u20442 days), which would be used by the CIA when interrogating suspects.[63][64] Comey objected to a second memorandum, drafted by Daniel Levin and signed by Steven G. Bradbury, which stated that these techniques could be used in combination.[63] Comey was one of the few members of the Bush administration who had tried to prevent or limit the use of torture.[65][66][67]\nDuring his 2013 confirmation hearing, Comey stated that in his personal opinion, waterboarding was torture,[68] the United Nations Convention against Torture was \"very vague\" and difficult to interpret as banning the practice.[54] Even though he believed the practice was legal at the time,[63] he strongly disagreed with the techniques and as a matter of policy, he opposed implementing them.[64][69] His objections were ultimately overruled by the National Security Council.[70]\nIn the fall of 2005, Comey announced that he was leaving the Department of Justice.[71] In August 2005, it was announced that Comey would enter the private sector, becoming the General Counsel and Senior Vice President for Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Department of Defense's largest contractor.[72] Comey's tenure took effect on October 1, 2005,[73] serving in that capacity until June 2, 2010, when he announced he would leave Lockheed Martin to join the senior management committee at Bridgewater Associates, a Connecticut-based investment management firm.[74] Comey received a three million dollar payout from Bridgewater, his net worth estimated at 14 million dollars.[75][75]\nOn February 1, 2013, after leaving Bridgewater, he was appointed by Columbia University Law School as a Senior Research Scholar and Hertog Fellow on National Security Law.[76] He was also appointed to the board of directors of the London-based financial institution HSBC Holdings,[77] to improve the company's compliance program after its $1.9\u00a0billion settlement with the Justice Department for failing to comply with basic due diligence requirements for money laundering regarding Mexican drug cartels and terrorism financing.[78][79] Since 2012, he has also served on the Defense Legal Policy Board.[80]\nIn May 2007, Comey testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the House Judiciary subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law on the U.S. Attorney dismissal controversy.[71] His testimony contradicted that of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who had said the firings had been due to poor performance on the part of some of the dismissed prosecutors. Comey stressed that the Justice Department had to be perceived as nonpartisan and nonpolitical to function.[81]\nThe Department of Justice, in my view, is run by political appointees of the President. The U.S. attorneys are political appointees of the President. But once they take those jobs and run this institution, it's very important in my view for that institution to be another in American life, that\u2014because my people had to stand up before juries of all stripes, talk to sheriffs of all stripes, judges of all stripes. They had to be seen as the good guys, and not as either this administration or that administration.[81]\nPolitico reported in May 2009, White House officials pushed for Comey's inclusion on the short list of names to replace Associate Justice David Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court.[82] Politico later reported liberal activists were upset about the possibility of Comey's name being included. John Brittain of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law stated, \"[Comey] came in with the Bushies. What makes you think he'd be just an inch or two more to the center than [John] Roberts? I'd be greatly disappointed.\"[83]\nIn 2013, Comey was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[84]\nThe May 2013 reports became official the following month when President Barack Obama revealed that he would nominate Comey to be the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, replacing outgoing director Robert Mueller.[85][86] Comey was reportedly chosen over another finalist, Lisa Monaco, who had overseen national security issues at the Justice Department during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012.[87][88]\nOn July 29, 2013, the Senate confirmed Comey to a full ten-year term as FBI Director. He was confirmed by a vote of 93\u20131. Two senators voted present.[89] He was sworn in as FBI director on September 4, 2013.[90] Comey was dismissed by President Donald Trump on May 9, 2017.[15]\n\nIn February 2015, Comey delivered a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., regarding the relationship between police and the African American community.[91][92] He said that, \"At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo \u2013 a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups,\" mentioning as an example his own Irish ancestors, who he said had, in the early 20th century, often been regarded by law enforcement as drunks and criminals. He added, \"The Irish had some tough times, but little compares to the experience on our soil of black Americans,\" going on to highlight current societal issues such as lack of opportunities for employment and education which can lead young black men to crime.[91] Comey stated:Police officers on patrol in our nation's cities often work in environments where a hugely disproportionate percentage of street crime is committed by young men of color. Something happens to people of good will working in that environment. After years of police work, officers often can't help be influenced by the cynicism they feel. A mental shortcut becomes almost irresistible.[91]In October 2015, Comey gave a speech in which he raised concerns that body worn video results in less effective policing; this opinion contradicted the President's public position.[93] Days later, President Obama met with Comey in the Oval Office to address the issue.[94]\n\nIn an October 23 speech at the University of Chicago Law School, Comey said:I remember being asked why we were doing so much prosecuting in black neighborhoods and locking up so many black men. After all, Richmond was surrounded by areas with largely white populations. Surely there were drug dealers in the suburbs. My answer was simple: We are there in those neighborhoods because that's where people are dying. These are the guys we lock up because they are the predators choking off the life of a community. We did this work because we believed that all lives matter, especially the most vulnerable.[95]In April 2015, Comey spoke at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, arguing in favor of more Holocaust education.[96] After The Washington Post printed a version of his speech, Anne Applebaum wrote that his reference to \"the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary\" was inaccurately saying that Poles were as responsible for the Holocaust as Germans.[97] His speech was also criticized by Polish authorities, and Stephen D. Mull, United States Ambassador to Poland, was called to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[98] Applebaum wrote that Comey, \"in a speech that was reprinted in The Post arguing for more Holocaust education, demonstrated just how badly he needs it himself\".[99]\nAmbassador Mull issued an apology for Comey's remarks.[100] When asked about his remarks, Comey said, \"I regret linking Germany and Poland ... The Polish state bears no responsibility for the horrors imposed by the Nazis. I wish I had not used any other country names because my point was a universal one about human nature.\"[101]\nIn June 2015, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people.[102] Later, Comey put the number at 18 million.[103] The Washington Post has reported that the attack originated in China, citing unnamed government officials.[104] Comey said: \"It is a very big deal from a national security perspective and from a counterintelligence perspective. It's a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for, or works for the United States government.\"[105]\nOn July 10, 2015, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State.[8] On June 29, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton met aboard her plane on the tarmac of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, leading to calls for her recusal. Lynch then announced that she would \"fully\" accept the recommendation of the FBI regarding the probe.[8] On July 2, FBI agents completed their investigation by interviewing Hillary Clinton at FBI headquarters, following which Comey and his associates decided there was no basis for criminal indictments in the case.[8]\nOn July 5, 2016, Comey announced the FBI's recommendation that the United States Department of Justice file no criminal charges relating to the Hillary Clinton email controversy.[106] During a 15-minute press conference in the J. Edgar Hoover Building, Comey called Secretary Clinton's and her top aides' behavior \"extremely careless\", but concluded that \"no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\". It was believed to be the first time the FBI disclosed its prosecutorial recommendation to the Department of Justice publicly.[106] On July 7, 2016, Comey was questioned by a Republican-led House committee during a hearing regarding the FBI's recommendation.[107][108]\nOn October 26, 2016, two weeks before the presidential election, Comey learned that FBI agents investigating an unrelated case involving former Congressman Anthony Weiner had discovered emails on Weiner's computer between his wife, Huma Abedin, and Hillary Clinton. Claiming he believed it would take months to review Weiner's emails, Comey decided he had to inform Congress that the investigation was being reopened due to new information.[8] Justice Department lawyers warned him that giving out public information about an investigation was inconsistent with department policy, but he considered the policy to be \"guidance\" rather than an ironclad rule.[109] He decided that to not reveal the new information would be misleading to Congress and the public.[110] On October 28, Comey sent a letter to members of Congress advising them that the FBI was reviewing more emails. Members of Congress revealed the information to the public within minutes.[111] Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as the Clinton and Trump campaigns, called on Comey to provide additional details.\nThe Clinton campaign and numerous former officials and other commentators criticized his decision to announce the reopened investigation.[112][113][114][115][116] Law professor Richard Painter filed complaints with the United States Office of Special Counsel and the United States Office of Government Ethics over Comey's letter to Congress.[117]\nThe investigators received additional resources so they could complete their review of the new emails before Election Day,[8] and on November 6, 2016, Comey wrote in a second letter to Congress that \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July\".[118]\nComey was broadly criticized for his actions from both the right and the left.[119][120][121][122] According to the Clinton campaign, the letters effectively stopped the campaign's momentum by hurting Clinton's chances with voters who were receptive to Trump's claims of a \"rigged system\".[123] Polling authority Nate Silver commented on Twitter that Comey had a \"large, measurable impact on the race.\"[124][125][10] Other analysts, such as Democratic strategist David Axelrod, said that Comey's public actions were just one of several cumulative factors that cost Clinton the election.[126][127] On May 2, 2017, Hillary Clinton told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\"[128] On May 3, 2017, Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that it \"makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election,\" but that \"honestly, it wouldn't change the decision.\"[129][130]\nOn January 12, 2017, the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General announced a formal investigation into whether the FBI followed proper procedures in its investigation of Clinton or whether \"improper considerations\" were made by FBI personnel.[131]\nOn July 27, 2017, the House Judiciary Committee decided to request documents related to Comey, including the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton, Comey's conduct during the 2016 election, and his release of his memo to the press.[132][133] The committee's Republicans also wrote a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to appoint a second special prosecutor to investigate these issues.[134]\nIn September 2017, two Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), alleged that Comey planned to exonerate Hillary Clinton in her email scandal long before the agency had completed its investigation.[135] The story was confirmed by the FBI in October, which released a Comey memo dated May 2. Comey interviewed Clinton as part of his investigation on July 2. Former FBI official Ron Hosko reacted saying, \"You tend to reach final conclusions as the investigation is logically ended. Not months before.\" Donald Trump called it \"disgraceful.\" In contrast, former Department of Justice spokesman Matthew Miller wrote on Twitter, \"The decision is never 'made' until the end, even when there's a 99% chance it is only going to go one way.\"[13]\nComey's original draft of the exoneration stated that Clinton had committed \"gross negligence,\" which is a crime. However, the language was later changed to \"extreme carelessness.\"[136] In December, it was revealed that the change had been made by Peter Strzok, an FBI official who would later join Mueller's probe and be dismissed after exchanging private messages with an FBI lawyer that could be seen as favoring Clinton politically.[137]\nOn June 14, 2018, Inspector General Michael Horowitz issued his report criticizing Comey's handling of the Clinton email probe as \"insubordinate\".[138] Specifically, he stated that Comey made \"a serious error in judgment\", \"usurped the authority of the Attorney General,\" \"chose to deviate\" from established procedures, and engaged \"in his own subjective, ad hoc decision making\" by publicly announcing that he wouldn't recommend any charges in the Clinton email investigation in July 2016 and later by sending a letter to Congress about reopening the case.[139] The report found no evidence of political bias, although other high-ranking FBI officials showed \"willingness to take official action\" to negatively impact the Trump campaign.[14]\nOn July 5, 2016, the day of Comey's press conference, the FBI acquired the Donald Trump-Russia dossier by Christopher Steele.[8] In late July, the FBI opened an investigation into the Trump campaign.[8] Comey asked President Obama for permission to write an op-ed, which would warn the public that the Russians were interfering in the election. The President denied the request.[8] CIA Director John O. Brennan then gave an unusual private briefing on the Russians to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid; Reid then publicly referred to the briefing.[8] Comey, however, refused to confirm\u2014even in classified Congressional briefings\u2014that the Trump Campaign was under investigation.[8] In early October, meetings were held in the White House Situation Room; National Security Advisor Susan Rice argued that the information should be released, while Comey argued that disclosure was no longer needed.[8]\nIn January 2017, Comey first met Trump when he briefed the President-elect on the Steele dossier.[140] On January 27, 2017, Trump and Comey dined alone at the White House.[140] According to Trump, Comey requested the dinner so as to ask to keep his job and, when asked, told Trump that he was not under investigation. Trump has stated that he did not ask Comey to pledge his loyalty. However, according to Comey's associates, Trump requested the dinner, asked Comey to pledge his loyalty, twice, to which Comey replied, twice, that he would always be honest, until Trump asked him if he would promise \"honest loyalty\", which Comey did.[140]\nOn February 14, the day after President Trump fired Michael T. Flynn, Comey met with the President during a terrorism threat briefing in the Oval Office.[141] At the end of the meeting Trump asked the other security chiefs to leave, then told Comey to consider imprisoning reporters over leaks and that \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\"[141] Comey, as is usual, immediately documented the meeting in a memo and shared it with FBI officials.[141] In his Congressional testimony, Comey clarified that he took Trump's comment to be \"an order\" to drop the Flynn investigation, but \"that he did not consider this an order to drop the Russia investigation as a whole.\"[142]\nOn March 4, Comey asked the Justice Department for permission, which was not given, to publicly refute Trump's claim that his phones had been wiretapped by then-President Obama.[143]\nOn March 20, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Comey confirmed that the FBI has been investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether any crimes were committed.[144] During the hearing, the White House Twitter account posted \"The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process,\" which Comey, when he was read the tweet by Congressman Jim Himes, directly refuted.[145] Comey also refuted the President's Trump Tower wiretapping allegations, testifying \"I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI.\"[146]\nU.S. Representative Chris Stewart (R-UT) asked Comey in the hearing: \"Mr. Clapper then went on to say that to his knowledge there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. We did not conclude any evidence in our report and when I say 'our report,' that is the NSA, FBI, and CIA with my office, the director of national intelligence said anything \u2013 any reflection of collusion between the members of Trump campaign and the Russians, there was no evidence of that in our report. Was Mr. Clapper wrong when he said that?\" Comey responded: \"I think he's right about characterizing the report which you all have read.\"[147] Press Secretary Sean Spicer and a White House tweet then highlighted this testimony as proof that Clapper was \"right\" there was no evidence of collusion, causing Clapper to release a statement clarifying he had been referring to the evidence as gathered in January and that more investigation is needed.[145]\nOn May 3, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said that Russia is the \"greatest threat of any nation on Earth ... One of the biggest lessons learned is that Russia will do this again. Because of 2016 election, they know it worked.\"[148] He also said that Russia should pay a price for interfering.[149]\nIn early May, a few days before he was fired, Comey reportedly asked the Justice Department for a significant increase in funding and personnel for the Russia probe.[16] On May 11, 2017, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he was unaware of the request and stated, \"I believe we have the adequate resources to do it and I know that we have resourced that investigation adequately.\"[150][151]\nComey had been scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on May 11, but after he was dismissed on May 9, committee chair Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) said that Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe would appear instead.[152] Comey spoke before the Committee on June 8.[153][154] His prepared opening statements were pre-released by the Intelligence Committee on their website one day before the official hearings.[155][156][157]\nIn his July 2013 FBI confirmation hearing, Comey said that the oversight mechanisms of the U.S. government have sufficient privacy protections.[158] In a November 2014 New York Times Magazine article, Yale historian Beverly Gage reported that Comey keeps on his desk a copy of the FBI request to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. \"as a reminder of the bureau's capacity to do wrong\".[159]\nIn 2016, Comey and his agency were criticized for their request to Apple Inc. to install a \"back door\" for U.S. surveillance agencies to use. Former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden stated: \"Jim would like a back door available to American law enforcement in all devices globally. And, frankly, I think on balance that actually harms American safety and security, even though it might make Jim's job a bit easier in some specific circumstances.\"[160] Comey, speaking at a cybersecurity conference in 2017, told the audience, \"There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America; there is no place outside of judicial reach.\"[161]\nPresident Trump formally dismissed Comey on May 9, 2017, less than 4 years into his 10-year term as Director of the FBI. Comey first learned of his termination from television news reports that flashed on screen while he was delivering a speech to agents at the Los Angeles Field Office.[162] Sources said he was surprised and caught off guard by the termination. Comey immediately departed for Washington, D.C., and was forced to cancel his scheduled speech that night at an FBI recruitment event.[163] Trump reportedly called Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the next day, demanding to know why Comey had been allowed to fly back to Washington on an FBI jet after he had been fired.[164]\nOn May 10, Comey sent a letter to FBI staff in which he said, \"I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.\"[165] In the absence of a Senate-confirmed FBI director, McCabe automatically became Acting Director.[166]\nThe White House initially stated the firing was on the recommendation of United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to both of whom Comey reported.[167] Rosenstein had sent a memorandum to Sessions, forwarded to Trump, in which Rosenstein listed objections to Comey's conduct in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.[168] It allowed the Trump administration to attribute Comey's firing to Rosenstein's recommendation about the Clinton email controversy. It was later revealed that on May 8, Trump had requested Sessions and Rosenstein to detail in writing a case against Comey.[169][170] Rosenstein's memo was forwarded to Trump on May 9 and was then construed as a recommendation to dismiss Comey, which Trump immediately did. In Trump's termination letter to Comey, he attributed the firing to the respective letters from Sessions and Rosenstein.[171][172] On May 10, Trump told reporters he had fired Comey because Comey \"wasn't doing a good job.\"[173] White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders added that the FBI rank and file had lost faith in Comey and that she had \"heard from countless members of the FBI ... grateful and thankful for the president's decision.\"[174]\nBy May 11, however, in a direct contradiction of the earlier statements by the White House, Vice President Mike Pence, and the contents of the dismissal letter itself, President Trump stated to Lester Holt in an NBC News interview that Comey's dismissal was in fact \"my decision\" and \"I was going to fire [Comey] regardless of recommendation [by Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein].\"[175][176] Trump later said of the dismissal \"when I decided to just do it [fire Comey], I said to myself, I said 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'\"[177] In the same televised interview, Trump labelled Comey \"a showboat\" and \"grandstander\".\nOn May 19, the New York Times published excerpts of an official White House document summarizing Trump's private meeting, the day after the firing, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the Russian Ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, in the Oval Office. Trump told Kislyak and Lavrov that he \"just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job.\" Trump added: \"I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off\", further adding \"I'm not under investigation.\"[20][178][179][180]\nAccording to reports, Trump had been openly talking to aides about finding a reason to fire Comey for at least a week before both the dismissal and the request of memoranda from Sessions and Rosenstein the day prior. Trump was angry and frustrated when, in the week prior to his dismissal, Comey revealed in Senate testimony the breadth of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia's effort to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He felt Comey was giving too much attention to the Russia probe and not enough to internal leaks to the press from within the government.[172][181] Shortly before Comey was fired, he had requested additional money and resources to further expand the probe into Russian interference into the Presidential election.[16] Trump had long questioned Comey's loyalty to him personally and Comey's judgment to act accordingly.[171] Moreover, Trump was angry that Comey would not support his claim that President Barack Obama had his campaign offices wiretapped.[181][182]\nOn May 16, 2017, it was first reported that Comey had prepared a detailed set of notes following every meeting and telephone call he had with President Trump.[183][184]\nOn May 12, Trump tweeted \"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\",[185] which the media, political and legal analysts, as well as opposition politicians, interpreted as a threat to Comey.[186] On June 8, when asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee about the existence of tapes, Comey replied \"Lordy, I hope there are tapes!\" He added that he would have no problem with the public release of any recordings.[187]\nOn June 22, after the House Judiciary committee threatened the White House with a potential subpoena for the alleged tapes, Trump issued a tweet stating \"I have no idea [...] whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.\"[188] Hours later, when asked to clarify the non-denial denial wording of Trump's tweet regarding the tapes, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Trump's tweet was \"extremely clear\" and that she did \"not have anything to add.\"[189] Questions raised for clarification on Trump's tweet centered principally around whether Trump ever had knowledge of said tapes having ever existed and whether he is simply no longer privy to the knowledge of whether said tapes still exist; whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump having made said tapes or recordings; and whether Trump currently has or ever had knowledge of a person or persons other than Trump currently having or previously having had in their possession said tapes or recordings. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), stated that Trump's tweet \"raises as many questions as it answers,\" and that in any event, the tweet did not comply with the June 23 deadline, and that Schiff would move forward with subpoenas for the tapes, adding that \"[r]egardless of whether the President intends his tweets to be an official reply to the House Intelligence Committee, the White House must respond in writing to our committee as to whether any tapes or recordings exist.\"[190]\nOn October 4, 2019, allegations of a possible White House recording system resurfaced after House Democrats, who have controlled US House of Representative since the 2018 election, issued a subpoena for White House documents, including any possible audio tapes,[191] following the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal, setting the stage for a legal battle which could go as far as the US Supreme Court.[192]\nComey's termination was immediately controversial. It was compared to the Saturday Night massacre, President Richard Nixon's termination of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had been investigating the Watergate scandal,[193][194] and to the firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates in January 2017. Many members of Congress expressed concern over the firing and argued that it would put the integrity of the investigation into jeopardy.[195] Critics accused Trump of obstruction of justice.[196]\nIn the dismissal letter, Trump stated that Comey had told him \"on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation.\"[197] Fact checkers reported that while they had no way of knowing what Comey may have told Trump privately, no such assertion was on the public record at that time of Comey directly stating that Trump was not personally under investigation.[198] However, in later Congressional testimony, Comey confirmed that on three occasions he volunteered to Trump that the latter was not personally under FBI investigation.[199][200]\nAccording to Comey associates interviewed by news organizations, Trump had asked Comey in January to pledge loyalty to him, to which Comey demurred, instead offering him \"honesty\".[140][201] Comey indicated he was willing to testify about his dismissal but only in an open hearing.[202] He declined an invitation from the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify before a closed-door session.[202]\nOn May 11, Acting Director McCabe testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that \"Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does\" and that \"the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey\". This contradicted White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said she had heard from \"countless\" FBI agents in support of the firing.[203]\nOn May 16, The New York Times revealed the existence of a memo Comey had written after a February 14 meeting with Trump. It said that Trump had asked him to drop the FBI's investigation into Mike Flynn, who had been fired as National Security Advisor the day before.[204] Comey later explained that he had arranged, through a friend, for the memo to be shared with the press in hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.[205]\nOn June 8, 2017, Comey gave public testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee about his firing. When asked why thought he had been fired, he said he had been confused by the shifting explanations for it but that \"I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation.\"[206] He said that he had made contemporaneous notes about several of his conversations with the president because \"I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting so I felt the need to document it.\"[206] He said he had not done so with the two previous presidents he had served.[citation needed]\nOn April 19, 2018, the Justice Department released 15 pages of documents to Congress which comprise partially declassified memos that Comey made after his meetings with Trump. The memos were released by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd in both a classified and unclassified versions. The unclassified version was obtained by Mary Clare Jalonick of the Associated Press on April 19 and published the next day.[207][208]\nIn June 2018, DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had received a referral from the FBI regarding Comey's release of his Trump meeting memos to Daniel Richman, parts of which were classified \"confidential\" after the fact.[209] The DOJ decided in July 2019 to not prosecute Comey, with Fox News quoting one official saying, \"Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn't a close call. They all thought this could not be prosecuted.\"[210]\nIn a second report released August 29, 2019, IG Horowitz found that Comey violated agency policies when he retained a set of memos he wrote documenting meetings with President Donald Trump early in 2017, and caused one of them to be leaked to the press.[22][211] Though Comey is said by the report to have set a \"dangerous example\" for FBI employees in an attempt to \"achieve a personally desired outcome,\" the Inspector General has found \"no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media\", and the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Comey.[22]\nMacmillan Publishers' Flatiron Books announced in August 2017 that it had acquired the rights to Comey's first book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership, in which he discusses ethics, leadership, and his experience in government.[212] Several publishers had submitted bids in an auction conducted by literary agency Javelin.[213][214][215] The release date was moved up from May 1, 2018 to April 17, 2018, due to scrutiny faced by the FBI during the Special Counsel investigation.[216] A month before the book was released, presale orders made it the top seller on Amazon.[217] The boom was attributed to a series of Twitter attacks on Comey by Trump, in which Trump claimed that Comey \"knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\"[218] In response, Comey tweeted, \"Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"[217] Comey's autobiography was well-received, with The New York Times calling it \"very persuasive\" and describing the book as \"absorbing\" in its book review,[219] stating \"Comey's memoir offers visceral details on a president untethered to truth.\"[220] Comey confirmed that the Twitter account @projectexile7 (later changed to @formerbu), which uses \"Reinhold Niebuhr\" as its display name, is operated by him.[221] Additionally, Comey has written the foreword for a forthcoming biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt entitled A Christian and a Democrat: A Religious Biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt published by William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.[222]\nIn the summer of 2017, Comey gave the convocation speech and a series of lectures at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. During the fall of 2018, Comey will return to his alma mater, the College of William &amp; Mary, to teach a course on ethical leadership. He will be an executive professor in education, a nontenured position at the College. Comey will join assistant professor Drew Stelljes to teach the course during the 2018\u20132019 academic year.[223]\nIn February 2019, in the midst of controversy surrounding a blackface picture in new Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook, and a national debate about the Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, Comey published an op ed in the Washington Post, suggesting that Virginia should get rid of the Confederate statues in Richmond: \"Expressing bipartisan horror at blackface photos is essential, but removing the statues would show all of America that Virginia really has changed.\"[224]\nOn May 1, 2019, in an opinion published by The New York Times, as Attorney General William Barr was scheduled to be questioned in congressional hearings, Comey asserted that \"[a]ccomplished people lacking inner strength can't resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from. It takes character like Mr. Mattis's to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.\"[225] He concluded with, \"Of course, to stay, you must be seen as on his team, so you make further compromises. You use his language, praise his leadership, tout his commitment to values. And then you are lost. He has eaten your soul.\"[226]\nComey was a registered Republican for most of his life. He donated to Senator John McCain's campaign in the 2008 presidential election and to Governor Mitt Romney's campaign in the 2012 presidential election.[227] He disclosed during Congressional testimony on July 7, 2016, that he was no longer registered with any party.[1] In an interview with ABC News on April 18, 2018, Comey said that the \"Republican Party [had] left [him] and many others,\" and that \"these people don't represent anything [he believes] in.\"[2] On July 18, 2018, Comey urged voters to vote for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections through Twitter. He wrote, \"This Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the Founders' design that 'Ambition must ... counteract ambition.' All who believe in this country's values must vote for Democrats this fall. Policy differences don't matter right now. History has its eyes on us.\"[228] He was donating to and canvassing votes for Democratic candidate Jennifer Wexton in those elections.[229]\nComey is of Irish descent and was raised in a Roman Catholic household[28][230] but now belongs to the United Methodist Church, where he has taught Sunday school.[231] He is 6\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (2.03\u00a0m) tall.[232]\nComey and his wife, Patrice Failor, are the parents of five children,[231] and a son who died in infancy. He has said that he learned to make something good happen after a tragedy.[233][234] They have also been foster parents.[235]\nTheir oldest daughter, Maurene, graduated from Harvard Law School in 2013 and the following year received a clerkship in U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.[236]  In 2015 she became Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and while still serving in this role was named a lead prosecutor in the office's case against Jeffery Epstein.[236]\n</body></html>"
