                "text": "no title\n\nLawrence Edward Page[3] (born March 26, 1973) is an American computer scientist and Internet entrepreneur. He is best known for being one of the co-founders of Google along with Sergey Brin.[1][4] Page was the chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc. (Google's parent company) until stepping down on December 3, 2019. After stepping aside as Google CEO in August 2001, in favor of Eric Schmidt, he re-assumed the role in April 2011. He announced his intention to step aside a second time in July 2015, to become CEO of Alphabet, under which Google's assets would be reorganized. Under Page, Alphabet seeked to deliver major advancements in a variety of industries.[5] On December 4, 2019, Page stepped down from his CEO position from Alphabet. Both Page and Sergey Brin will remain controlling shareholders of Alphabet.[6] As of January 2020, Page is the 8th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $66.3 billion.[1] Forbes placed him 10th in the list \"Billionaires 2019\".[7] Page is the co-inventor of PageRank, a well-known search ranking algorithm for Google, which he wrote with Brin.[15] Page received the Marconi Prize in 2004 with Brin.[16] Page was born on March 26, 1973,[17] in Lansing, Michigan.[18][19] His mother is Jewish;[20] his maternal grandfather later made aliyah to Israel.[19] However, he does not declare to follow any formal religion.[20][21] His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan, when the field was being established, and BBC reporter Will Smale has described him as a \"pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence\".[22] He was a computer science professor at Michigan State University and Page's mother, Gloria, was an instructor in computer programming at Lyman Briggs College of Michigan State University.[23][22][24] During an interview, Page recalled his childhood. Noting that his house \"was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and Popular Science magazines all over the place\", an environment in which he immersed himself.[25] Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: \"I remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines\" .[26] According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents \"fostered creativity and invention\". Page also played the flute and studied music composition while growing up. He attended the renowned music summer camp \u2014 Interlochen Arts Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. \"In some sense, I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me\". In an interview Page said that \"In music, you're very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing\" and that \"If you think about it from a music point of view, if you're a percussionist, you hit something, it's got to happen in milliseconds, fractions of a second\".[8][27] Page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to \"play with the stuff lying around\"\u2014first-generation personal computers\u2014that had been left by his mother and father.[23] He became the \"first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor\".[28] His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking \"everything in his house apart to see how it worked\". He said that \"from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology and business. Probably from when I was 12, I knew I was going to start a company eventually.\"[28] Page attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from East Lansing High School in 1991. He attended Interlochen Center for the Arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school. Page holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University.[29] While at the University of Michigan, Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges\u2014Page reverse-engineered the ink cartridge, and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it.[23] Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu fraternity,[30] and was a member of the 1993 \"Maize & Blue\" University of Michigan Solar Car team.[31] As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a personal rapid transit system, which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger.[8] He also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.[27] After enrolling in a computer science PhD program at Stanford University, Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph. His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received.[32] He also considered doing research on telepresence and self-driving cars during this time.[33][34][35][36] Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page. The role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research.[36] Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub.\"[36] Together, the pair authored a research paper titled \"The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\" , which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.[23][34] John Battelle, co-founder of Wired magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that the: ... entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation\u2014after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it \"the Web would become a more valuable place.\"[36]Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project: At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler. The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. \"I talked to lots of research groups\" around the school, Brin recalls, \"and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry.\"[36]To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones.[36] The algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another.[37] Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the now nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.[36] After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.[38] Page and Brin used the former's basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.[36] By early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows: Some Rough Statistics (from August 29, 1996) Total indexable HTML URLs: 75.2306 Million Total content downloaded: 207.022 gigabytes ... BackRub is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux. The primary database is kept on a Sun Ultra series II with 28GB of disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help. Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks. BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: \"We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages.\"[40] Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: \"Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real.\"[38] Page and Brin's vision has been compared to that of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:[41] In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts \u2013 originally replicated by hand \u2013 to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance ... Google has done a similar job.The comparison was also noted by the authors of The Google Story: \"Not since Gutenberg ... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.\"[42] Also, not long after the two \"cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web\" such as digitizing books and expanding health information.[38] Mark Malseed wrote in a 2003 feature story:Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Brin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in Menlo Park. ... [soon after], Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a $100,000 check to \"Google, Inc.\" The only problem was, \"Google, Inc.\" did not yet exist\u2014the company hadn't yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money.[43]In 1998,[44] Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc.[45] with the initial domain name of \"Googol\", derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros\u2014representing the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. Following inception, Page appointed himself as CEO, while Brin, named Google's co-founder, served as Google's president.[8] Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014:While Google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes\u2014Sergey and Larry, Larry and Sergey\u2014the truth is that Google is a creation of Larry Page, helped along by Sergey Brin.[8]The pair's mission was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\"[46] With a US$1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, Page experimented with smaller servers so Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses the company rented for their servers. This eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Google's competitors at the time.[8] By June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited NEC Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that \"there are more than 1 billion web pages online today\", with Google \"providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs.\"[47] During his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001. Page's plan involved all of Google's engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to him\u2014Page explained that he didn't like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge.[8] Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference: Even though Page's new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction more broadly. Eventually, the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across Silicon Valley.[48] Page also believed that the faster Google's search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. He fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers\u2014from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers\u2014to think about lag times. He also pushed for keeping Google's home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster.[27] Before Silicon Valley's two most prominent investors, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital, agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million in Google, they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a \"world-class management team.\" Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including Steve Jobs and Intel's Andrew Grove. Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as Chairman of Google in March 2001, left his full-time position as the CEO of Novell to take the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Page moved aside to assume the President of Products role.[8] Under Schmidt's leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its initial public offering (IPO) on August 20, 2004. He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system. Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.[8] Page led the acquisition of Android for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt's knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder Andy Rubin. By September 2008, T-Mobile launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2% of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world's most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.[8] Following a January 2011 announcement,[49] Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman.[50] By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees.[51] After Schmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, he jokingly tweeted on Twitter: \"Adult-supervision no longer needed.\" Quartz organizational management reporter, Max Nisen, described the decade prior to Page's second appointment as Google's CEO as his \"lost decade.\" While Page continued to exert a significant influence at Google during this time, overseeing product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.[8][48] As Google's new CEO, Page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication, and unity among the teams. Page also formed what the media called the \"L-Team\", a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week.[52] Additionally, he reorganized the company's senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google's most important product divisions, including YouTube, AdWords, and Google Search.[8] In accordance with a more cohesive team environment, Page declared a new \"zero tolerance for fighting\" policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role, as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of Page's collaborative rejuvenation process, Google's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul.[48][53] At least 70 of Google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified.[54][55] Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, \"Project Kennedy\", based on Page's use of the term \"moonshots\" to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 Wired interview.[53][56] An initiative named \"Kanna\" previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company's history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the Android user experience when \"Kennedy\" started, explained in 2013 that \"Google passionately cares about design.\" Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to his question of what a \"cohesive vision\" of Google might look like.[53] The eventual results of \"Kennedy\" which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by The Verge technology publication as focused upon \"refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity.\" The final products were aligned with Page's aim for a consistent suite of products that can \"move fast\", and \"Kennedy\" was called a \"design revolution\" by Duarte. Page's \"UXA\" (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the \"Kennedy\" project, tasked with \"designing and developing a true UI framework that transforms Google's application software into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users.\" Unspoken of in public, the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that \"Kennedy\" became an \"institution.\"[53] When acquiring products and companies for Google, Page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question \"Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?\". This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.[57][58][59] With Facebook's influence rapidly expanding during the start of Page's second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with Google's own social network, Google+, in mid-2011. After several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by Vic Gundotra, Google's then senior vice president of social.[60] In August 2011, Page announced that Google would spend $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility.[61] The purchase was primarily motivated by Google's need to secure patents to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including Apple Inc.[8] Page wrote on Google's official blog on August 15, 2011 that \"companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The United States Department of Justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to 'protect competition and innovation in the open source software community' ... Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies\".[62][63] In 2014, Page sold Motorola Mobility for $2.9 billion to Personal Computer maker, Lenovo which represented a loss in value of $9.5 billion over two years.[64] Page also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the Chromebook in May 2012. The hardware product was a laptop that ran on a Google operating system, Chrome OS.[65] In January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with Wired, in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page's \"10X\" mentality\u2014Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitors\u2014in the introductory blurb. Astro Teller, the head of Google X, explained to Levy that 10X is \"just core to who he [Page] is\", while Page's \"focus is on where the next 10X will come from.\"[56] In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of \"crazy\" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: \"If you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things.\"[56] Page also stated he was \"very happy\" with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet in relation to the SOPA bill and an International Telecommunication Union proposal that had been recently introduced:... I do think the Internet's under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they're a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms. But they've also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users' freedoms at their own peril.[56]At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in San Francisco, Page delivered a keynote address and said \"We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity ... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist\" and that he was \"sad the Web isn't advancing as fast as it should be\", citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero-sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause.[66] In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with Microsoft, whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google but did not allow for backward compatibility\u2014he referred to Microsoft's practice as \"milking off\". During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in Burning Man, which Brin had previously praised\u2014it was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.[8][67][68] In September 2013, Page launched the independent Calico initiative, a R&D project in the field of biotechnology. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of Genentech, to be the new division's CEO. Page's official statement read: \"Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives.\"[69] Page participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The presentation was scripted by Page's chief PR executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google's CMO Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.[8] Page responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a \"bad rap\", which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing \"50 or 20 years ago\". He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. Page mentioned Elon Musk and SpaceX:He [Musk] wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. That's a worthy goal. We have a lot of employees at Google who've become pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world and make it better ... I'd like for us to help out more than we are.[70]Page also mentioned Nikola Tesla with regard to invention and commercialization:Invention is not enough. [Nikola] Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. [You have to] combine both things ... invention and innovation focus, plus ... a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people.[71]Page announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making. In a memo, Page said that Google's core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner, while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects, including Google X initiatives; access and energy, including Google Fiber; smart-home automation through Nest Labs; and biotechnology innovations under Calico.[72] Page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial \"chief product officer\".[55] Subsequent to the announcement, the executives in charge of Google's core products reported to then Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai, who reported directly to Page.[72][73][74][75] In a November 2014 interview, Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his \"deep knowledge\" of Google's products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members. In relation to his then role as the company's CEO, Page said: \"I think my job as CEO\u2014I feel like it's always to be pushing people ahead.\"[55] On August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc with Page becoming CEO of Alphabet Inc and Sundar Pichai assuming the position of CEO of Google Inc. In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:[76]Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. ... Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related.As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha\u2011bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!Page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google \"cleaner and more accountable.\" He also wrote that there was a desire to improve \"the transparency and oversight of what we're doing\" and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.[76][77][78] Page has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013. The Bloomberg Businessweek termed the reorganization into Alphabet as a clever retirement plan allowing Page to retain control over Google, at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over it. Executives at Alphabet describe Page as a \"futurist\" , highly detached from day-to-day business dealings and more focused on moon-shot projects. While some managers of Alphabet companies speak of Page as intensely involved, others say that his rare office check-ins are \"akin to a royal visit\" .[79] On December 3, 2019, Larry Page announced that he will step down from the position of Alphabet CEO and would be replaced by Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai will also continue as Google CEO. Page and Google co-founder and Alphabet president Sergey Brin announced the change in a joint blog post, \"With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it\u2019s the natural time to simplify our management structure. We\u2019ve never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there\u2019s a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President.\"[80] Page is an investor in Tesla Motors.[81] He has invested in renewable energy technology, and with the help of Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, promotes the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric cars[82][83][84][85] and other alternative energy investments.[86] He is also a strategic backer in the Opener startup which is developing aerial vehicles for consumer travel.[87] Page is also interested in the socio-economic effects of advanced intelligent systems and how advanced digital technologies can be used to create abundance (as described in Peter Diamandis' book), provide for people's needs, shorten the workweek, and mitigate the potential detrimental effects of technological unemployment.[88][89] Page also helped to set up Singularity University, a transhumanist think-tank.[90] Google is one of the institution's corporate founders[91] and still funds scholarships at Singularity University.[92] In 2007, Page married Lucinda Southworth on Necker Island, the Caribbean island owned by Richard Branson.[93] Southworth is a research scientist and the sister of actress and model Carrie Southworth.[94] Page and Southworth have two children, born in 2009 and 2011.[95][96] On February 18, 2005, Page bought a 9,000 square feet (840\u00a0m2) Spanish Colonial Revival architecture house in Palo Alto, California designed by American artistic polymath Pedro Joseph de Lemos, a former curator of the Stanford Art Museum and founder of the Carmel Art Institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of US$7.95 million. A two-story stucco archway spans the driveway and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California Arts and Crafts movement style built to resemble de Lemos's family's castle in Spain. The hacienda was constructed between 1931 and 1941 by de Lemos.[97][98][99][100][101] It is also on the National Register of Historic Places.[102]In 2009 Page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in Palo Alto to make room for a large ecohouse. The existing buildings were \"deconstructed\" and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to \"minimize the impact on the environment.\" Page worked with an arborist to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. Page also applied for Green Point Certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-VOC (volatile organic compound) materials and for a roof garden with solar panels. The house's exterior features zinc cladding and plenty of windows, including a wall of sliding-glass doors in the rear. It includes eco-friendly elements such as permeable paving in the parking court and a pervious path through the trees on the property. The 6,000-square-foot (560m\u00b2) house also observes other green home design features such as organic architecture building materials and low volatile organic compound paint.[103][104][105][106] In 2011, Page bought the $45-million 193-foot (59m) superyacht 'Senses'. 'Senses' has extensive ocean exploration capabilities, the superyacht was created to explore the world's oceans in comfort and it carries a comprehensive inventory of equipment for that purpose.[107] 'Senses' was built by Fr. Schweers Shipyard in (Germany) at their Berne shipyard. 'Senses' features a displacement steel hull and a steel/aluminium superstructure, with teak decks. 'Senses' is equipped with an ultra-modern stabilization system which reduces the free surface effect and results in a smoother cruising experience underway.[108] Page announced on his Google+ profile in May 2013 that his right vocal cord is paralyzed from a cold that he contracted the previous summer, while his left cord was paralyzed in 1999.[109] Page explained that he has been suffering from a vocal cord issue for 14 years, and, as of his May 2013 post, doctors were unable to identify the exact cause. The Google+ post also revealed that Page had donated a considerable sum of money to a vocal-cord nerve-function research program at the Voice Health Institute in Boston, US. The program, at Massachusetts General Hospital, is led by Steven Zeitels, the Eugene B. Casey Professor of Laryngeal Surgery. An anonymous source stated that the donation exceeded $20 million.[110] In October 2013, Business Insider reported that Page's paralyzed vocal cords are caused by an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and prevented him from undertaking Google quarterly earnings conference calls for an indefinite period.[111] In November 2014, Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Fund, reportedly holding assets in excess of a billion dollars at the end of 2013, gave $15 million to aid the effort against the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. Page wrote on his Google+ page that \"My wife and I just donated $15 million ... Our hearts go out to everyone affected.\" [112][113][114][115]",

He is best known for being one of the co-founders of Google along with Sergey Brin.[1][4]\nPage was the chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc. (Google's parent company) until stepping down on December 3, 2019. After stepping aside as Google CEO in August 2001, in favor of Eric Schmidt, he re-assumed the role in April 2011. He announced his intention to step aside a second time in July 2015, to become CEO of Alphabet, under which Google's assets would be reorganized. Under Page, Alphabet seeked to deliver major advancements in a variety of industries.[5] On December 4, 2019, Page stepped down from his CEO position from Alphabet. Both Page and Sergey Brin will remain controlling shareholders of Alphabet.[6]\nAs of January 2020, Page is the 8th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $66.3 billion.[1] Forbes placed him 10th in the list \"Billionaires 2019\".[7]\nPage is the co-inventor of PageRank, a well-known search ranking algorithm for Google, which he wrote with Brin.[15] Page received the Marconi Prize in 2004 with Brin.[16]\nPage was born on March 26, 1973,[17] in Lansing, Michigan.[18][19] His mother is Jewish;[20] his maternal grandfather later made aliyah to Israel.[19] However, he does not declare to follow any formal religion.[20][21] His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan, when the field was being established, and BBC reporter Will Smale has described him as a \"pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence\".[22] He was a computer science professor at Michigan State University and Page's mother, Gloria, was an instructor in computer programming at Lyman Briggs College of Michigan State University.[23][22][24]\nDuring an interview, Page recalled his childhood. Noting that his house \"was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and Popular Science magazines all over the place\", an environment in which he immersed himself.[25] Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: \"I remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines\" .[26] According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents \"fostered creativity and invention\". Page also played the flute and studied music composition while growing up. He attended the renowned music summer camp \u2014  Interlochen Arts Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. \"In some sense, I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me\". In an interview Page said that \"In music, you're very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing\" and that \"If you think about it from a music point of view, if you're a percussionist, you hit something, it's got to happen in milliseconds, fractions of a second\".[8][27]\nPage was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to \"play with the stuff lying around\"\u2014first-generation personal computers\u2014that had been left by his mother and father.[23] He became the \"first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor\".[28] His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking \"everything in his house apart to see how it worked\". He said that \"from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology and business. Probably from when I was 12, I knew I was going to start a company eventually.\"[28]\nPage attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from East Lansing High School in 1991. He attended Interlochen Center for the Arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school. Page holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University.[29] While at the University of Michigan, Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges\u2014Page reverse-engineered the ink cartridge, and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it.[23] Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu fraternity,[30] and was a member of the 1993 \"Maize &amp; Blue\" University of Michigan Solar Car team.[31] As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a personal rapid transit system, which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger.[8] He also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.[27]\nAfter enrolling in a computer science PhD program at Stanford University, Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph. His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received.[32] He also considered doing research on telepresence and self-driving cars during this time.[33][34][35][36]\nPage focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page. The role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research.[36] Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub.\"[36] Together, the pair authored a research paper titled \"The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\" , which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.[23][34]\nJohn Battelle, co-founder of Wired magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that the:\n... entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation\u2014after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it \"the Web would become a more valuable place.\"[36]Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:\nAt the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler. The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. \"I talked to lots of research groups\" around the school, Brin recalls, \"and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry.\"[36]To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones.[36] The algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another.[37]\nCombining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the now nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.[36] After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.[38]\nPage and Brin used the former's basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.[36]\nBy early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows:\nSome Rough Statistics (from August 29, 1996)\nTotal indexable HTML URLs: 75.2306 Million\nTotal content downloaded: 207.022 gigabytes\n...\nBackRub is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux. The primary database is kept on a Sun Ultra series II with 28GB of disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help. Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks.\nBackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: \"We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages.\"[40] Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: \"Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real.\"[38]\nPage and Brin's vision has been compared to that of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:[41]\nIn 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts \u2013 originally replicated by hand \u2013 to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance ... Google has done a similar job.The comparison was also noted by the authors of The Google Story: \"Not since Gutenberg ... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.\"[42] Also, not long after the two \"cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web\" such as digitizing books and expanding health information.[38]\n\nMark Malseed wrote in a 2003 feature story:Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Brin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in Menlo Park. ... [soon after], Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a $100,000 check to \"Google, Inc.\" The only problem was, \"Google, Inc.\" did not yet exist\u2014the company hadn't yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money.[43]In 1998,[44] Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc.[45] with the initial domain name of \"Googol\", derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros\u2014representing the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. Following inception, Page appointed himself as CEO, while Brin, named Google's co-founder, served as Google's president.[8] Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014:While Google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes\u2014Sergey and Larry, Larry and Sergey\u2014the truth is that Google is a creation of Larry Page, helped along by Sergey Brin.[8]The pair's mission was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\"[46] With a US$1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, Page experimented with smaller servers so Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses the company rented for their servers. This eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Google's competitors at the time.[8]\nBy June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited NEC Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that \"there are more than 1 billion web pages online today\", with Google \"providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs.\"[47]\nDuring his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001. Page's plan involved all of Google's engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to him\u2014Page explained that he didn't like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge.[8] Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:\nEven though Page's new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction more broadly. Eventually, the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across Silicon Valley.[48]\nPage also believed that the faster Google's search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. He fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers\u2014from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers\u2014to think about lag times. He also pushed for keeping Google's home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster.[27]\nBefore Silicon Valley's two most prominent investors, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Sequoia Capital, agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million in Google, they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a \"world-class management team.\" Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including Steve Jobs and Intel's Andrew Grove. Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as Chairman of Google in March 2001, left his full-time position as the CEO of Novell to take the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Page moved aside to assume the President of Products role.[8]\nUnder Schmidt's leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its initial public offering (IPO) on August 20, 2004. He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system. Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.[8]\nPage led the acquisition of Android for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt's knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder Andy Rubin. By September 2008, T-Mobile launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2% of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world's most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.[8]\nFollowing a January 2011 announcement,[49] Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman.[50] By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees.[51]\nAfter Schmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, he jokingly tweeted on Twitter: \"Adult-supervision no longer needed.\" Quartz organizational management reporter, Max Nisen, described the decade prior to Page's second appointment as Google's CEO as his \"lost decade.\" While Page continued to exert a significant influence at Google during this time, overseeing product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.[8][48]\nAs Google's new CEO, Page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication, and unity among the teams. Page also formed what the media called the \"L-Team\", a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week.[52] Additionally, he reorganized the company's senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google's most important product divisions, including YouTube, AdWords, and Google Search.[8]\nIn accordance with a more cohesive team environment, Page declared a new \"zero tolerance for fighting\" policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role, as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of Page's collaborative rejuvenation process, Google's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul.[48][53]\nAt least 70 of Google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified.[54][55] Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, \"Project Kennedy\", based on Page's use of the term \"moonshots\" to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 Wired interview.[53][56] An initiative named \"Kanna\" previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company's history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the Android user experience when \"Kennedy\" started, explained in 2013 that \"Google passionately cares about design.\" Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to his question of what a \"cohesive vision\" of Google might look like.[53]\nThe eventual results of \"Kennedy\" which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by The Verge technology publication as focused upon \"refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity.\"  The final products were aligned with Page's aim for a consistent suite of products that can \"move fast\",  and \"Kennedy\" was called a \"design revolution\" by Duarte. Page's \"UXA\" (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the \"Kennedy\" project, tasked with \"designing and developing a true UI framework that transforms Google's application software into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users.\" Unspoken of in public, the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that \"Kennedy\" became an \"institution.\"[53]\nWhen acquiring products and companies for Google, Page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question \"Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?\". This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.[57][58][59]\nWith Facebook's influence rapidly expanding during the start of Page's second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with Google's own social network, Google+, in mid-2011. After several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by Vic Gundotra, Google's then senior vice president of social.[60]\nIn August 2011, Page announced that Google would spend $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility.[61] The purchase was primarily motivated by Google's need to secure patents to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including Apple Inc.[8] Page wrote on Google's official blog on August 15, 2011 that \"companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The United States Department of Justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to 'protect competition and innovation in the open source software community' ... Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies\".[62][63] In 2014, Page sold Motorola Mobility for $2.9 billion to Personal Computer maker, Lenovo which represented a loss in value of $9.5 billion over two years.[64]\nPage also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the Chromebook in May 2012. The hardware product was a laptop that ran on a Google operating system, Chrome OS.[65]\n\nIn January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with Wired, in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page's \"10X\" mentality\u2014Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitors\u2014in the introductory blurb. Astro Teller, the head of Google X, explained to Levy that 10X is \"just core to who he [Page] is\", while Page's \"focus is on where the next 10X will come from.\"[56] In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of \"crazy\" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: \"If you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things.\"[56] Page also stated he was \"very happy\" with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet in relation to the SOPA bill and an International Telecommunication Union proposal that had been recently introduced:... I do think the Internet's under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they're a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms. But they've also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users' freedoms at their own peril.[56]At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in San Francisco, Page delivered a keynote address and said \"We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity ... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist\" and that he was \"sad the Web isn't advancing as fast as it should be\", citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero-sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause.[66] In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with Microsoft, whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google but did not allow for backward compatibility\u2014he referred to Microsoft's practice as \"milking off\". During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in Burning Man, which Brin had previously praised\u2014it was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.[8][67][68]\nIn September 2013, Page launched the independent Calico initiative, a R&amp;D project in the field of biotechnology. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of Genentech, to be the new division's CEO. Page's official statement read: \"Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives.\"[69]\nPage participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The presentation was scripted by Page's chief PR executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google's CMO Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.[8]\n\nPage responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a \"bad rap\", which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing \"50 or 20 years ago\". He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. Page mentioned Elon Musk and SpaceX:He [Musk] wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. That's a worthy goal. We have a lot of employees at Google who've become pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world and make it better ... I'd like for us to help out more than we are.[70]Page also mentioned Nikola Tesla with regard to invention and commercialization:Invention is not enough. [Nikola] Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. [You have to] combine both things ... invention and innovation focus, plus ... a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people.[71]Page announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making. In a memo, Page said that Google's core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner, while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects, including Google X initiatives; access and energy, including Google Fiber; smart-home automation through Nest Labs; and biotechnology innovations under Calico.[72] Page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial \"chief product officer\".[55] Subsequent to the announcement, the executives in charge of Google's core products reported to then Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai, who reported directly to Page.[72][73][74][75]\nIn a November 2014 interview, Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his \"deep knowledge\" of Google's products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members. In relation to his then role as the company's CEO, Page said: \"I think my job as CEO\u2014I feel like it's always to be pushing people ahead.\"[55]\n\nOn August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc with Page becoming CEO of Alphabet Inc and Sundar Pichai assuming the position of CEO of Google Inc. In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:[76]Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. ... Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related.As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha\u2011bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!Page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google \"cleaner and more accountable.\"  He also wrote that there was a desire to improve \"the transparency and oversight of what we're doing\" and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.[76][77][78]\nPage has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013. The Bloomberg Businessweek termed the reorganization into Alphabet as a clever retirement plan allowing Page to retain control over Google, at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over it. Executives at Alphabet describe Page as a \"futurist\" , highly detached from day-to-day business dealings and more focused on moon-shot projects. While some managers of Alphabet companies speak of Page as intensely involved, others say that his rare office check-ins are \"akin to a royal visit\" .[79]\nOn December 3, 2019, Larry Page announced that he will step down from the position of Alphabet CEO and would be replaced by Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai will also continue as Google CEO. Page and Google co-founder and Alphabet president Sergey Brin announced the change in a joint blog post, \"With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it\u2019s the natural time to simplify our management structure. We\u2019ve never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there\u2019s a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President.\"[80]\nPage is an investor in Tesla Motors.[81] He has invested in renewable energy technology, and with the help of Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, promotes the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric cars[82][83][84][85] and other alternative energy investments.[86] He is also a strategic backer in the Opener startup which is developing aerial vehicles for consumer travel.[87]\nPage is also interested in the socio-economic effects of advanced intelligent systems and how advanced digital technologies can be used to create abundance (as described in Peter Diamandis' book), provide for people's needs, shorten the workweek, and mitigate the potential detrimental effects of technological unemployment.[88][89]\nPage also helped to set up Singularity University, a transhumanist think-tank.[90] \nGoogle is one of the institution's corporate founders[91] and still funds scholarships at Singularity University.[92]\nIn 2007, Page married Lucinda Southworth on Necker Island, the Caribbean island owned by Richard Branson.[93] Southworth is a research scientist and the sister of actress and model Carrie Southworth.[94] Page and Southworth have two children, born in 2009 and 2011.[95][96]\n\nOn February 18, 2005, Page bought a 9,000 square feet (840\u00a0m2) Spanish Colonial Revival architecture house in Palo Alto, California designed by American artistic polymath Pedro Joseph de Lemos, a former curator of the Stanford Art Museum and founder of the Carmel Art Institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of US$7.95 million. A two-story stucco archway spans the driveway and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California Arts and Crafts movement style built to resemble de Lemos's family's castle in Spain. The hacienda was constructed between 1931 and 1941 by de Lemos.[97][98][99][100][101] It is also on the National Register of Historic Places.[102]In 2009 Page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in Palo Alto to make room for a large ecohouse. The existing buildings were \"deconstructed\"  and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to \"minimize the impact on the environment.\"  Page worked with an arborist to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. Page also applied for Green Point Certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-VOC (volatile organic compound) materials and for a roof garden with solar panels. The house's exterior features zinc cladding and plenty of windows, including a wall of sliding-glass doors in the rear. It includes eco-friendly elements such as permeable paving in the parking court and a pervious path through the trees on the property. The 6,000-square-foot (560m\u00b2) house also observes other green home design features such as organic architecture building materials and low volatile organic compound paint.[103][104][105][106]\nIn 2011, Page bought the $45-million 193-foot (59m) superyacht 'Senses'. 'Senses' has extensive ocean exploration capabilities, the superyacht was created to explore the world's oceans in comfort and it carries a comprehensive inventory of equipment for that purpose.[107] 'Senses' was built by Fr. Schweers Shipyard in (Germany) at their Berne shipyard. 'Senses' features a displacement steel hull and a steel/aluminium superstructure, with teak decks. 'Senses' is equipped with an ultra-modern stabilization system which reduces the free surface effect and results in a smoother cruising experience underway.[108]\nPage announced on his Google+ profile in May 2013 that his right vocal cord is paralyzed from a cold that he contracted the previous summer, while his left cord was paralyzed in 1999.[109] Page explained that he has been suffering from a vocal cord issue for 14 years, and, as of his May 2013 post, doctors were unable to identify the exact cause. The Google+ post also revealed that Page had donated a considerable sum of money to a vocal-cord nerve-function research program at the Voice Health Institute in Boston, US. The program, at Massachusetts General Hospital, is led by Steven Zeitels, the Eugene B. Casey Professor of Laryngeal Surgery. An anonymous source stated that the donation exceeded $20 million.[110]\nIn October 2013, Business Insider reported that Page's paralyzed vocal cords are caused by an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and prevented him from undertaking Google quarterly earnings conference calls for an indefinite period.[111]\nIn November 2014, Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Fund, reportedly holding assets in excess of a billion dollars at the end of 2013, gave $15 million to aid the effort against the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. Page wrote on his Google+ page that \"My wife and I just donated $15 million ... Our hearts go out to everyone affected.\" [112][113][114][115]\n</body></html>"

He rose to become the company's Product Chief, then Google's CEO in 2015, as part of the restructuring process that made Alphabet Inc. into Google's parent company.[8][9] In December 2019, he additionally became CEO of Alphabet Inc.[10][11] Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.[12][13] His mother Lakshmi was a stenographer and his father, Regunatha Pichai was an electrical engineer at GEC, the British conglomerate. His father also had a manufacturing plant that produced electrical components.[14][15] Pichai grew up in a two-room apartment in Ashok Nagar, Chennai.[14] Pichai completed schooling in Jawahar Vidyalaya, a Central Board of Secondary Education school in Ashok Nagar, Chennai and completed the Class XII from Vana Vani school in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.[16][17] He earned his degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in metallurgical engineering and is a distinguished alumnus from that institution.[18] He holds an M.S. from Stanford University in material sciences and engineering, and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[19] where he was named a Siebel Scholar and a Palmer Scholar, respectively.[20][21] Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company.[22] Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome[23] and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps.[24][25] On November 19, 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of Chrome OS; the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012.[26] On May 20, 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.[27] On March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversees. Android was formerly managed by Andy Rubin.[28] He was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to July 30, 2013.[29][30][31] Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015[8] after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On October 24, 2015 he stepped into the new position at the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family.[9][31][32] Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to Satya Nadella.[33][34] In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google employee who wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing the company's diversity policies and arguing that \"distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and ... these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership\".[35][36][37][38] While noting that the manifesto raised a number of issues that are open to debate, Pichai said in a memo to Google employees that \"to suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK\".[39] In December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China, where he stated that \"a lot of work Google does is to help Chinese companies. There are many small and medium-sized businesses in China who take advantage of Google to get their products to many other countries outside of China.\"[40][41] On December 11, 2018, Pichai testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on a wide range of Google-related issues such as the alleged, potential political bias on Google\u2019s platforms, the company's alleged plans for a \"censored search app\" in China, and its privacy practices.[42] Pichai, in response, stated that Google employees cannot influence search results. He also stated that Google users can opt out of having their data collected and that \"there are no current plans for a censored search engine\" in China.[43] Wired's Issie Lapowsky characterized Pichai's appearance before the committee as one \"major missed opportunity,\" since, as she wrote, its members \"staked out opposite sides of a partisan battle,\" and presented to the public \"a foreboding reminder of Congress's continued technological ignorance.\"[44] He is married to Anjali Pichai, n\u00e9e Wiki, a chemical engineer from Kota, Rajasthan. They met as classmates at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.[45] The couple have two children.[46] Pichai's interests include football and cricket.[47][48]",

He rose to become the company's Product Chief, then Google's CEO in 2015, as part of the restructuring process that made Alphabet Inc. into Google's parent company.[8][9] In December 2019, he additionally became CEO of Alphabet Inc.[10][11]\nPichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.[12][13] His mother Lakshmi was a stenographer and his father, Regunatha Pichai was an electrical engineer at GEC, the British conglomerate. His father also had a manufacturing plant that produced electrical components.[14][15] Pichai grew up in a two-room apartment in Ashok Nagar, Chennai.[14]\nPichai completed schooling in Jawahar Vidyalaya, a Central Board of Secondary Education school in Ashok Nagar, Chennai and completed the Class XII from Vana Vani school in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.[16][17] He earned his degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in metallurgical engineering and is a distinguished alumnus from that institution.[18] He holds an M.S. from Stanford University in material sciences and engineering, and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[19] where he was named a Siebel Scholar and a Palmer Scholar, respectively.[20][21]\nPichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey &amp; Company.[22] Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome[23] and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps.[24][25] On November 19, 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of Chrome OS; the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012.[26] On May 20, 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.[27]\nOn March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversees. Android was formerly managed by Andy Rubin.[28] He was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to July 30, 2013.[29][30][31] Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015[8] after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On October 24, 2015 he stepped into the new position at the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family.[9][31][32]\nPichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to Satya Nadella.[33][34]\nIn August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google employee who wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing the company's diversity policies and arguing that \"distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and ... these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership\".[35][36][37][38] While noting that the manifesto raised a number of issues that are open to debate, Pichai said in a memo to Google employees that \"to suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK\".[39]\nIn December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China, where he stated that \"a lot of work Google does is to help Chinese companies. There are many small and medium-sized businesses in China who take advantage of Google to get their products to many other countries outside of China.\"[40][41]\nOn December 11, 2018, Pichai testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on a wide range of Google-related issues such as the alleged, potential political bias on Google\u2019s platforms, the company's alleged plans for a \"censored search app\" in China, and its privacy practices.[42] Pichai, in response, stated that Google employees cannot influence search results. He also stated that Google users can opt out of having their data collected and that \"there are no current plans for a censored search engine\" in China.[43] Wired's Issie Lapowsky characterized Pichai's appearance before the committee as one \"major missed opportunity,\" since, as she wrote, its members \"staked out opposite sides of a partisan battle,\" and presented to the public \"a foreboding reminder of Congress's continued technological ignorance.\"[44]\nHe is married to Anjali Pichai, n\u00e9e Wiki, a chemical engineer from Kota, Rajasthan. They met as classmates at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.[45] The couple have two children.[46] Pichai's interests include football and cricket.[47][48]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nMartin Shkreli (/\u02c8\u0283kr\u025bli/; born March 17, 1983) is an American businessman, former hedge fund manager, and convicted felon.[7][8] He was the co-founder of the hedge funds Elea Capital, MSMB Capital Management, and MSMB Healthcare;[9] co-founder and former chief executive officer (CEO) of the biotechnology firm Retrophin; and founder and former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Shkreli is the former CEO of start-up software company G\u00f6del Systems, which he founded in August 2016.[10] In September 2015, Shkreli received widespread criticism when Turing obtained the manufacturing license for the antiparasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price by a factor of 56 (from US$13.5 to $750 per pill), leading him to be referred to by the media as \"the most hated man in America\" and \"Pharma Bro\".[11][12][13] Shkreli was charged in federal court, then convicted on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud.[3] In 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and up to $7.4 million in fines.[14] Shkreli was born in Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, New York City, on March 17, 1983.[1] His parents are Albanian and Croatian who emigrated from Montenegro and worked as janitors.[15] He, his two sisters, and his brother grew up in a working-class community in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.[7][16][17] By most accounts, Shkreli was raised Catholic and attended Sunday school as a child.[18] Shkreli attended Hunter College High School. He dropped out before his senior year but received the credits necessary for his diploma through a program that placed him in an internship at Wall Street hedge fund Cramer, Berkowitz and Company when he was 17.[16][19] Sources differ on whether Shkreli graduated from Hunter[17] or whether he received sufficient credits there but actually graduated from City-As-School High School.[20] In March 2015, Hunter College High School announced that Shkreli had donated $1,000,000 which was the largest donation in the school's history.[21] Shkreli received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Baruch College in 2004. Shkreli told Vanity Fair that he developed an interest in chemistry when a family member suffered from treatment-resistant depression.[22] During Shkreli's time at Cramer, Berkowitz and Company, he recommended short-selling the stock of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company testing a weight-loss drug. When its price dropped in accordance with Shkreli's prediction, Cramer's hedge fund profited. Shkreli's prediction drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigated Shkreli's knowledge about the stock but was unable to prove wrongdoing on his part.[23] After four years as an associate at Cramer Berkowitz, Shkreli worked as a financial analyst for Intrepid Capital Management and UBS Wealth Management.[24] He then started his first hedge fund, Elea Capital Management, in 2006.[19][25] In 2007, Lehman Brothers sued Elea in New York state court for failing to cover a 'put option transaction' in which Shkreli bet the wrong way on a broad market decline. When stocks rose, Shkreli didn't have the funds to make the bank whole. In October 2007, Lehman Brothers won a $2.3 million default judgment against Shkreli and Elea, but Lehman collapsed before it could collect on the ruling.[23] In September 2009, Shkreli started his own business. He launched MSMB Capital Management,[15][26] which took its name from the initials of the two founding portfolio managers, Shkreli and his childhood friend, Marek Biestek.[19][23] Shkreli and Biestek shorted biotech companies, then described flaws in the companies on stock trading chat rooms.[22] On February 1, 2011, in a naked short sale on an account it held with Merrill Lynch, MSMB Capital sold short 32 million shares of Orexigen Therapeutics stock at about $2.50 per share the day after its price plunged from $9.09, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve the drug Contrave.[27][28] The stock price rebounded; MSMB could not cover the position, although it had told Merrill Lynch that it could.[29] Merrill Lynch lost $7 million on the trade and MSMB Capital was virtually wiped out. Retrophin's 2015 SEC Complaint contended Shkreli had created MSMB Healthcare and Retrophin \"so that he could continue trading after MSMB Capital became insolvent and to create an asset that he might be able to use to placate his MSMB Capital investors.\"[30] In 2011, Shkreli filed requests with the FDA to reject a new cancer diagnostic device from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals and an inhalable insulin therapy from MannKind Corporation while publicly short-selling both companies' stocks, the values of which dropped after Shkreli's interventions. The companies had difficulty launching the products as a result, although the FDA ultimately approved both.[23][31][32] In 2011, MSMB made an unsolicited cash bid for AMAG Pharmaceuticals, US$378,000,000.[33] Matthew Herper of Forbes wrote that the attempted hostile takeover was \"done for the specific purpose of firing the company's management and stopping a proposed merger with Allos Therapeutics. When the merger plans stopped, so did Shkreli.\"[34] Shkreli founded Retrophin (a portmanteau of \"recombinant dystrophin\") in 2011 under the MSMB umbrella, and ran it as a portfolio company with an emphasis on biotechnology, to create treatments for rare diseases.[23][35][36][37] Retrophin's board decided to replace Shkreli in September 2014, and he resigned from the company the following month.[30] He was replaced by Stephen Aselage.[38] During Shkreli's tenure as CEO, the company's employees used alias Twitter accounts to make gangster rap jokes and encourage short selling of other biotech stocks.[39] After Shkreli's departure, Retrophin filed a US$65 million lawsuit against him in August 2015, claiming that he had breached his duty of loyalty to the biopharmaceutical company in a long-running dispute over his use of company funds[30][36][40] and \"committed stock-trading irregularities and other violations of securities rules\".[41] The lawsuit alleged that Shkreli had threatened and harassed a former MSMB employee and his family.[42] Shkreli and some of his business associates have been under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York since January 2015. Shkreli invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying during civil depositions.[43][44] Shkreli's name is on two patents held by Retrophin for drugs to treat PKAN.[22][45] Critics argued that Shkreli was intelligent but too immature and unfocused for the job of CEO.[46] In July 2017, at Shkreli's criminal trial, Aselage testified: \"He's [Shkreli's] a brilliant intellect, visionary.\"[47] In May 2014, Shkreli had difficulty accessing public markets for capital, but received a $4 million series A funding round and a PIPE deal valued at $10 million underwritten by Roth Capital Partners.[48] After obtaining the financing, Shkreli was able to acquire rights to market tiopronin (brand name, Thiola), a drug used to treat the rare disease cystinuria and Chenodal and subsequently raise the price of each drug substantially, with Thiola subsequently being marked up about 20 fold, from $1.50 to $30 per pill (patients must take 10 to 15 pills a day),[49][50] and Chenodal about fivefold.[citation needed] Retrophin did not lower the price of these drugs after Shkreli's departure.[51] In 2016, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals introduced a lower cost version marketed as a compounded drug.[52] Shkreli founded Turing Pharmaceuticals in February 2015, after his departure from Retrophin. He launched Turing with three drugs in development acquired from Retrophin: an intranasal version of ketamine for depression, an intranasal version of oxytocin, and Vecamyl for hypertension.[53] Shkreli set a business strategy for Turing: to obtain licenses on out-of-patent medicines and reevaluate the pricing of each in pursuit of windfall profits for the new company, without the need to develop and bring its own drugs to market.[54][55] As markets for out-of-patent drugs are often small, and obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture a generic version is expensive, Turing calculated that with closed distribution for the product and no competition, it could set high prices.[54] On August 10, 2015, in accordance with Shkreli's business plan, Turing acquired Daraprim (pyrimethamine), a medication approved by the FDA in 1953,[56] from Impax Laboratories[57] for US$55 million.[58] The drug's most prominent use as of late 2015 was as an anti-malarial[59] and an antiparasitic, in conjunction with leucovorin and sulfadiazine,[60] to treat patients with AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated toxoplasmosis.[61] The patent for Daraprim had expired, but no generic version was available.[62] The Turing\u2013Impax deal included the condition that Impax remove the drug from regular wholesalers and pharmacies,[59] and so in June 2015, two months before the sale to Turing was announced, Impax switched to tightly controlled distribution.[19] In keeping with its strategy for pricing in the face of limited competition (see above), Turing maintained the closed distribution.[54] The New York Times noted that the deal \"made sense only if Turing planned to raise the price of the drug substantially.\"[19] On September 17, 2015, Dave Muoio of Healio, an in-depth clinical information website for health care specialists,[63] reported on a letter from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association to executives at Turing,[64] questioning a new pricing for Daraprim.[61] The price of a dose of the drug in the U.S. market increased from US$13.50 to US$750 per pill, overnight, a factor of 56.[65] The price increase was initially criticized, jointly, by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association,[59][64] by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,[66] and soon thereafter by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton,[67] Bernie Sanders,[68] and Donald Trump.[69] A subsequent organized effort called on Turing to return pricing to pre-September levels and to address several matters relating to the needs of patients, an effort that garnered endorsements from more than 160 medical\u2011specialty and patient\u2011related organizations (as of December 2015[update], 164 organizations from thirty-one states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico).[70][71] In response to the controversy, the record label Collect Records publicly ended its business relationship with Shkreli, who had invested in the company.[72] In a September 2015 interview with Bloomberg Markets, Shkreli claimed that despite the price increase, patient co-pays would actually be lower, that many patients would get the drug at no cost, that Turing had expanded its free drug program, and that it sold half of its drugs for one dollar.[73] He defended the price hike by saying, \"If there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don't think that that should be a crime.\"[74][75] A few days later, Shkreli announced that he planned to lower the price by an unspecified amount, \"in response to the anger that was felt by people\".[43] But in late November, Turing reversed course and said it would not lower the price after all.[76] Following a request by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings for details of Turing Pharmaceuticals' finances and price-setting practices in September 2015,[77][78] the company hired four lobbyists from Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney with backgrounds in health care legislation and pharmaceutical pricing.[79][80] In addition to lobbyists, Shkreli hired a crisis public relations firm to help explain the pricing decision.[81] On October 22, 2015, Mark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, announced that his company would provide a combination product containing pyrimethamine (the active ingredient in Daraprim) and leucovorin at \"$1-a-pill\" as a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Daraprim.[82] This product is intended to be used alongside sulfadiazine in the standard protocol to treat toxoplasmosis typically seen in AIDS patients.[61] Baum noted, \"This is not the first time a sole supply generic drug\u00a0\u2013 especially one that has been approved for use as long as Daraprim\u00a0\u2013 has had its price increased suddenly and to a level that may make it unaffordable\". He announced the availability of the compounded replacement for Daraprim as a part of a larger corporate program, \"Imprimis Cares\", to make \"novel and customizable medicines available to physicians and patients at accessible prices\". Imprimis is now offering its compounded, orally taken formulations of pyrimethamine and leucovorin beginning at US$99 for a 100\u2011count bottle, essentially a dollar a dose.[82] On November 23, 2015, Turing announced that the company would not reduce the list price of Daraprim, but said it planned instead to negotiate volume discounts of up to 50% for hospitals.[83] Turing issued a statement that it was not as important to cut the list price as to reduce the cost to hospitals, where most patients get their initial treatment. The company pledged that no patient needing Daraprim would ever be denied access.[76] Infectious disease specialists and patient advocates, including Tim Horn of the Treatment Action Group and Carlos del Rio of the HIV Medicine Association, said Turing's actions were insufficient, given that patients initially treated for days at a hospital typically have to continue the treatment for weeks or months after leaving.[84] After Shkreli was imprisoned, Turing changed its name to Vyera in 2017.[85] to avoid negative publicity, and is presently named Phoenixus. In March 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shkreli \"steers his old company from prison\".[86] Using a contraband cellphone from his ward in prison at Ft. Dix, N.J., Shkreli was effectively directing the renamed firm, and was reported to have terminated the employment of executive Kevin P. Mulleady.[87] After this news was reported in various news outlets, Shkreli was moved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn in advance of a subsequent move to a Federal prison in Pennsylvania.[88] He was also facing a Bureau of Prisons investigation into his breaking federal prison rules, since federal inmates are prohibited both from running a business from prison and from possessing cell phones.[89] In November 2015, an investor group led by Shkreli acquired a majority stake in KaloBios Pharmaceuticals (OTC Pink\u00a0Limited: KBIOQ), a biopharmaceutical company based in South San Francisco, California.[90] Shkreli was named CEO of the company and also planned to continue in the role of CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals.[91][92] After his December 2015 arrest, KaloBios Pharmaceuticals terminated him as CEO.[93] On December 29, 2015, KaloBios filed for Chapter\u00a011 bankruptcy. This followed NASDAQ delisting its shares, and the resignation of two directors.[94] Shkreli founded G\u00f6del Systems in August 2016 as \"a professional software company that aims to be the leading information provider of data, workflow, and communications solutions for financial, law, and scientific professionals.\" By February 2017, G\u00f6del Systems was looking to raise $1 million through a debt offering, and had raised $50,000 out of the $1 million in debt it began issuing in mid-January 2017, according to regulatory filings. Ralph Holzmann, a former senior engineer at Twitter, is the firm's chief technology officer. Shkreli was subpoenaed to appear before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives to answer questions about the Daraprim price increase.[11] Shkreli's efforts to quash the subpoena were unsuccessful.[11] On February 4, 2016, Shkreli appeared before the House committee,[95] along with Nancy Retzlaff,[96] the Chief Commercial Officer of Turing, and Howard B. Schiller, the interim CEO of Valeant.[97] Shkreli followed his lawyer's advice and refused to answer any questions, except to confirm his name[98][99]\u00a0\u2013 including those related to his acquisition of the most expensive music album ever made[100]\u00a0\u2013 by exercising his Fifth Amendment rights.[101] On December 17, 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI after a federal indictment[102] in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York was filed, charging him with securities fraud. The charges were filed after an investigation into his tenure at MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin. He was accused of running a Ponzi-like scheme.[4] Federal prosecutors said that Shkreli \"engaged in multiple schemes to ensnare investors through a web of lies and deceit.\"[103][104] In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Shkreli said that he was targeted by law enforcement for his price hikes of the drug Daraprim and his flamboyant personality.[105] In early 2016, Shkreli retained criminal defense attorney Benjamin Brafman to defend him.[106][107] Due to his notoriety and overwhelmingly negative public opinion, it was difficult to select an unbiased jury, with potential jurors stating \"I'm aware of the defendant and I hate him\", \"he kind of looks like a dick\", and \"he disrespected the Wu Tang Clan\".[108] At his 2017 trial, Shkreli argued that none of his investors actually lost money (some actually turned a profit) and thus his actions did not constitute a crime.[109] Shkreli's frequent criticisms of the federal prosecutors in New York's Eastern District, whom he called \"junior varsity\" compared to their counterparts in the Southern District across the East River, both on his Facebook streaming video feed and in the hallways of the courthouse, led those prosecutors to request that judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto issue a gag order to prevent what they called a \"campaign of disruption.\" Brafman claimed in response that his client was responding to baiting from the media and was also suffering from extreme anxiety because of his situation.[110] Matsumoto ordered Shkreli not to speak with reporters, either in the courthouse or its immediate vicinity.[111] On August 4, 2017, the trial jury found Shkreli guilty on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and not guilty on five other counts.[112] Shkreli said he was delighted with the outcome and described his prosecution as \"a witch hunt of epic proportions.\"[113] On September 13, 2017, his bail was revoked following a Facebook post offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair which the judge perceived as solicitation to assault, which is not protected under the First Amendment.[114] Shkreli's post was preceded by others that suggested he might have plans to clone Hillary Clinton.[115] Shkreli said that his post was satire, and his lawyer described it as tasteless but not a threat.[115] Shkreli edited the post to add a disclaimer that it was satire,[116] and later said he did this minutes after publication.[117] Shkreli apologized for the post.[118] He was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn[6] while awaiting sentencing.[118][119] Shkreli appealed the conviction,[120] but, in 2019, an appeals court unanimously upheld the jury verdict.[121] The original judgment remained in effect; Shkreli must continue to serve his 7-year sentence and forfeit more than $7.3 million in assets. The panel of judges issued the ruling just three weeks after hearing arguments in the appeal, rather than the normal period of months. The ruling was also unusually short, spanning only seven pages.[121][122] On March 5, 2018, Shkreli was ordered to forfeit nearly $7.4 million in assets.[123] The court ordered that if Shkreli had insufficient cash to fulfill the forfeiture order, his assets\u2014including a piece of art by Pablo Picasso, his unique Wu-Tang album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, the then unreleased Lil Wayne album Tha Carter V, and Shkreli's pharmaceutical company shares\u2014could be seized.[124] In April, he was ordered to pay $388,000 in restitution.[125] During his sentencing, judge Kiyo Matsumoto said Shkreli seemed \"genuinely remorseful,\" regarding his \"egregious multitude of lies,\" but said he had \"repeatedly minimized\" his misconduct. Shkreli, who reportedly cried as he gave his statement to the court, stated \"I was never motivated by money.\"[126] On March 9, 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in federal prison.[14][127] He is federal inmate number 87850-053 and was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn prior to being transferred to federal prison.[128] On March 27, 2018, it was reported that Judge Kiyo Matsumoto agreed to recommend Shkreli serve his prison sentence at the minimum security federal camp at USP Canaan, which he had previously requested.[129][130] On April 18, 2018, Shkreli was transferred from Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn to FCI Fort Dix after his request to serve at USP Canaan was denied. As of August 2019, Shkreli is serving his sentence at FCC Allenwood.[6] Several media outlets on 6 September 2019 reported that Shkreli leveled a lawsuit against a former investor into his Elea Capital fund before a Brooklyn court, \"accusing him of fraudulently inducing Shkreli into signing a promissory note that has left him owing $420,000 to the man\u2019s father.\"[131][132] In December 2016, the New York state Department of Taxation and Finance issued a tax warrant for $1.26 million for unpaid taxes owed by Shkreli. After Shkreli made partial payments, the state recouped another $134,500 from Shkreli by seizing and auctioning off an Enigma machine for $65,000, a manuscript signed by Isaac Newton, a letter from Charles Darwin, and another letter written by English mathematician and writer Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace. On April 23, 2018, it was reported that in court filings New York's attorney general had asked Judge Matsumoto for priority on more than $480,000 in court-ordered forfeitures, to recover additional unpaid taxes and penalties owed to the state, over the federal government's claims for Shkreli's forfeited assets. Prior to Shkreli's conviction, the state of New York had been aggressively attempting to collect the tax debts from Shkreli and had already seized and auctioned off several of items including the rare Nazi Enigma code machine. At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Shkreli had agreed to an order that would bar him from the securities industry in order to settle a pending SEC administrative action against him, however, Shkreli is eligible to apply for readmission to the industry subject to applicable laws and regulations governing the process.[120] In January 2016, Fortune estimated the then-32-year-old Shkreli's net worth was at least $45 million but later updated its profile to reflect that \"[S]ince this article was published the value of Shkreli's E*Trade account had dropped by more than $40 million\".[133] Shkreli leveraged a $4 million E-Trade account for his bail.[134] In June 2017, Reuters reported that Shkreli had reported his net worth at $70 million after being arrested in 2015 and that his attorney Benjamin Brafman, in a hearing before Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, had conceded that his client still owned shares of Turing Pharmaceuticals worth between $30 to $50 million.[135] Shkreli, an avid League of Legends player, began expressing interest in purchasing an eSports team in May 2014.[136] Enemy eSports rejected a US$1.2 million offer from Shkreli.[137] He later founded his own team, Odyssey eSports, and aimed to qualify for the 2015 North American League of Legends Challenger Series but the team failed. In August 2015, Odyssey merged with another team to become the organisation Team Imagine, with Shkreli becoming chairman of the team. During the merger, the organization signed the Dota\u00a02 team Leviathan.[138][139] Shkreli won an auction for the Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin after the single copy of the album was sold via Paddle8 on November 24, 2015, for US$2 million.[100][140] In October 2016, Shkreli claimed on his Twitter that he would release the album for free download if Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election and would destroy the album if Hillary Clinton won.[141] He shared the intro and one track the day after Trump became the president-elect.[142] In September 2017,[143] Shkreli attempted to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin on eBay, with the winning bid passing $1m. He was incarcerated on unrelated fraud counts before the sale could be completed.[144] In March 2018, following Shkreli's conviction for fraud, a federal court seized assets belonging to him worth $7.36m, including Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.[145] In February 2016, he announced in an offer letter $10 million to become the sole owner of Kanye West's album The Life of Pablo.[146][147] On February 12, 2016, Shkreli increased his offer for West's The Life of Pablo from $10 million to $15 million.[148] Shkreli was formerly a benefactor of Collect Records, a record label run by musician Geoff Rickly, and offered to bail out rapper Bobby Shmurda; Shkreli retracted this offer after his own arrest.[149][150] In February 2017, Shkreli was invited to speak at Harvard University. The requested travel was approved by a judge.[151][152][153].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}",

Shkreli is the former CEO of start-up software company G\u00f6del Systems, which he founded in August 2016.[10]\nIn September 2015, Shkreli received widespread criticism when Turing obtained the manufacturing license for the antiparasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price by a factor of 56 (from US$13.5 to $750 per pill), leading him to be referred to by the media as \"the most hated man in America\" and \"Pharma Bro\".[11][12][13]\nShkreli was charged in federal court, then convicted on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud.[3] In 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and up to $7.4 million in fines.[14]\nShkreli was born in Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, New York City, on March 17, 1983.[1] His parents are Albanian and Croatian who emigrated from Montenegro and worked as janitors.[15] He, his two sisters, and his brother grew up in a working-class community in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.[7][16][17] By most accounts, Shkreli was raised Catholic and attended Sunday school as a child.[18]\nShkreli attended Hunter College High School. He dropped out before his senior year but received the credits necessary for his diploma through a program that placed him in an internship at Wall Street hedge fund Cramer, Berkowitz and Company when he was 17.[16][19] Sources differ on whether Shkreli graduated from Hunter[17] or whether he received sufficient credits there but actually graduated from City-As-School High School.[20] In March 2015, Hunter College High School announced that Shkreli had donated $1,000,000 which was the largest donation in the school's history.[21] Shkreli received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Baruch College in 2004.\nShkreli told Vanity Fair that he developed an interest in chemistry when a family member suffered from treatment-resistant depression.[22]\nDuring Shkreli's time at Cramer, Berkowitz and Company, he recommended short-selling the stock of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company testing a weight-loss drug. When its price dropped in accordance with Shkreli's prediction, Cramer's hedge fund profited. Shkreli's prediction drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigated Shkreli's knowledge about the stock but was unable to prove wrongdoing on his part.[23]\nAfter four years as an associate at Cramer Berkowitz, Shkreli worked as a financial analyst for Intrepid Capital Management and UBS Wealth Management.[24] He then started his first hedge fund, Elea Capital Management, in 2006.[19][25] In 2007, Lehman Brothers sued Elea in New York state court for failing to cover a 'put option transaction' in which Shkreli bet the wrong way on a broad market decline. When stocks rose, Shkreli didn't have the funds to make the bank whole. In October 2007, Lehman Brothers won a $2.3 million default judgment against Shkreli and Elea, but Lehman collapsed before it could collect on the ruling.[23]\nIn September 2009, Shkreli started his own business. He launched MSMB Capital Management,[15][26] which took its name from the initials of the two founding portfolio managers, Shkreli and his childhood friend, Marek Biestek.[19][23]    Shkreli and Biestek shorted biotech companies, then described flaws in the companies on stock trading chat rooms.[22]\nOn February 1, 2011, in a naked short sale on an account it held with Merrill Lynch, MSMB Capital sold short 32 million shares of Orexigen Therapeutics stock at about $2.50 per share the day after its price plunged from $9.09, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve the drug Contrave.[27][28] The stock price rebounded; MSMB could not cover the position, although it had told Merrill Lynch that it could.[29] Merrill Lynch lost $7 million on the trade and MSMB Capital was virtually wiped out. Retrophin's 2015 SEC Complaint contended Shkreli had created MSMB Healthcare and Retrophin \"so that he could continue trading after MSMB Capital became insolvent and to create an asset that he might be able to use to placate his MSMB Capital investors.\"[30]\nIn 2011, Shkreli filed requests with the FDA to reject a new cancer diagnostic device from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals and an inhalable insulin therapy from MannKind Corporation while publicly short-selling both companies' stocks, the values of which dropped after Shkreli's interventions. The companies had difficulty launching the products as a result, although the FDA ultimately approved both.[23][31][32]\nIn 2011, MSMB made an unsolicited cash bid for AMAG Pharmaceuticals, US$378,000,000.[33] Matthew Herper of Forbes wrote that the attempted hostile takeover was \"done for the specific purpose of firing the company's management and stopping a proposed merger with Allos Therapeutics. When the merger plans stopped, so did Shkreli.\"[34]\nShkreli founded Retrophin (a portmanteau of \"recombinant dystrophin\") in 2011 under the MSMB umbrella, and ran it as a portfolio company with an emphasis on biotechnology, to create treatments for rare diseases.[23][35][36][37]\nRetrophin's board decided to replace Shkreli in September 2014, and he resigned from the company the following month.[30] He was replaced by Stephen Aselage.[38] During Shkreli's tenure as CEO, the company's employees used alias Twitter accounts to make gangster rap jokes and encourage short selling of other biotech stocks.[39]\nAfter Shkreli's departure, Retrophin filed a US$65 million lawsuit against him in August 2015, claiming that he had breached his duty of loyalty to the biopharmaceutical company in a long-running dispute over his use of company funds[30][36][40] and \"committed stock-trading irregularities and other violations of securities rules\".[41] The lawsuit alleged that Shkreli had threatened and harassed a former MSMB employee and his family.[42]\nShkreli and some of his business associates have been under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York since January 2015. Shkreli invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying during civil depositions.[43][44]\nShkreli's name is on two patents held by Retrophin for drugs to treat PKAN.[22][45]\nCritics argued that Shkreli was intelligent but too immature and unfocused for the job of CEO.[46] In July 2017, at Shkreli's criminal trial, Aselage testified: \"He's [Shkreli's] a brilliant intellect, visionary.\"[47]\nIn May 2014, Shkreli had difficulty accessing public markets for capital, but received a $4 million series A funding round and a PIPE deal valued at $10 million underwritten by Roth Capital Partners.[48] After obtaining the financing, Shkreli was able to acquire rights to market tiopronin (brand name, Thiola), a drug used to treat the rare disease cystinuria and Chenodal and subsequently raise the price of each drug substantially, with Thiola subsequently being marked up about 20 fold, from $1.50 to $30 per pill (patients must take 10 to 15 pills a day),[49][50] and Chenodal about fivefold.[citation needed] Retrophin did not lower the price of these drugs after Shkreli's departure.[51]\nIn 2016, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals introduced a lower cost version marketed as a compounded drug.[52]\nShkreli founded Turing Pharmaceuticals in February 2015, after his departure from Retrophin. He launched Turing with three drugs in development acquired from Retrophin: an intranasal version of ketamine for depression, an intranasal version of oxytocin, and Vecamyl for hypertension.[53] Shkreli set a business strategy for Turing: to obtain licenses on out-of-patent medicines and reevaluate the pricing of each in pursuit of windfall profits for the new company, without the need to develop and bring its own drugs to market.[54][55] As markets for out-of-patent drugs are often small, and obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture a generic version is expensive, Turing calculated that with closed distribution for the product and no competition, it could set high prices.[54]\nOn August 10, 2015, in accordance with Shkreli's business plan, Turing acquired Daraprim (pyrimethamine), a medication approved by the FDA in 1953,[56] from Impax Laboratories[57] for US$55 million.[58] The drug's most prominent use as of late 2015 was as an anti-malarial[59] and an antiparasitic, in conjunction with leucovorin and sulfadiazine,[60] to treat patients with AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated toxoplasmosis.[61]\nThe patent for Daraprim had expired, but no generic version was available.[62] The Turing\u2013Impax deal included the condition that Impax remove the drug from regular wholesalers and pharmacies,[59] and so in June 2015, two months before the sale to Turing was announced, Impax switched to tightly controlled distribution.[19] In keeping with its strategy for pricing in the face of limited competition (see above), Turing maintained the closed distribution.[54] The New York Times noted that the deal \"made sense only if Turing planned to raise the price of the drug substantially.\"[19]\nOn September 17, 2015, Dave Muoio of Healio, an in-depth clinical information website for health care specialists,[63] reported on a letter from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association to executives at Turing,[64] questioning a new pricing for Daraprim.[61] The price of a dose of the drug in the U.S. market increased from US$13.50 to US$750 per pill, overnight, a factor of 56.[65]\nThe price increase was initially criticized, jointly, by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association,[59][64] by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,[66] and soon thereafter by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton,[67] Bernie Sanders,[68] and Donald Trump.[69]\nA subsequent organized effort called on Turing to return pricing to pre-September levels and to address several matters relating to the needs of patients, an effort that garnered endorsements from more than 160 medical\u2011specialty and patient\u2011related organizations (as of December 2015[update], 164 organizations from thirty-one states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico).[70][71]\nIn response to the controversy, the record label Collect Records publicly ended its business relationship with Shkreli, who had invested in the company.[72]\nIn a September 2015 interview with Bloomberg Markets, Shkreli claimed that despite the price increase, patient co-pays would actually be lower, that many patients would get the drug at no cost, that Turing had expanded its free drug program, and that it sold half of its drugs for one dollar.[73] He defended the price hike by saying, \"If there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don't think that that should be a crime.\"[74][75]\nA few days later, Shkreli announced that he planned to lower the price by an unspecified amount, \"in response to the anger that was felt by people\".[43] But in late November, Turing reversed course and said it would not lower the price after all.[76]\nFollowing a request by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings for details of Turing Pharmaceuticals' finances and price-setting practices in September 2015,[77][78] the company hired four lobbyists from Buchanan, Ingersoll &amp; Rooney with backgrounds in health care legislation and pharmaceutical pricing.[79][80] In addition to lobbyists, Shkreli hired a crisis public relations firm to help explain the pricing decision.[81]\nOn October 22, 2015, Mark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, announced that his company would provide a combination product containing pyrimethamine (the active ingredient in Daraprim) and leucovorin at \"$1-a-pill\" as a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Daraprim.[82] This product is intended to be used alongside sulfadiazine in the standard protocol to treat toxoplasmosis typically seen in AIDS patients.[61]\nBaum noted, \"This is not the first time a sole supply generic drug\u00a0\u2013 especially one that has been approved for use as long as Daraprim\u00a0\u2013 has had its price increased suddenly and to a level that may make it unaffordable\". He announced the availability of the compounded replacement for Daraprim as a part of a larger corporate program, \"Imprimis Cares\", to make \"novel and customizable medicines available to physicians and patients at accessible prices\". Imprimis is now offering its compounded, orally taken formulations of pyrimethamine and leucovorin beginning at US$99 for a 100\u2011count bottle, essentially a dollar a dose.[82]\nOn November 23, 2015, Turing announced that the company would not reduce the list price of Daraprim, but said it planned instead to negotiate volume discounts of up to 50% for hospitals.[83] Turing issued a statement that it was not as important to cut the list price as to reduce the cost to hospitals, where most patients get their initial treatment. The company pledged that no patient needing Daraprim would ever be denied access.[76]\nInfectious disease specialists and patient advocates, including Tim Horn of the Treatment Action Group and Carlos del Rio of the HIV Medicine Association, said Turing's actions were insufficient, given that patients initially treated for days at a hospital typically have to continue the treatment for weeks or months after leaving.[84]\nAfter Shkreli was imprisoned, Turing changed its name to Vyera in 2017.[85] to avoid negative publicity, and is presently named Phoenixus. In March 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shkreli \"steers his old company from prison\".[86]  Using a contraband cellphone from his ward in prison at Ft. Dix, N.J., Shkreli was effectively directing the renamed firm, and was reported to have terminated the employment of executive Kevin P. Mulleady.[87] After this news was reported in various news outlets, Shkreli was moved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn in advance of a subsequent move to a Federal prison in Pennsylvania.[88] He was also facing a Bureau of Prisons investigation into his breaking federal prison rules, since federal inmates are prohibited both from running a business from prison and from possessing cell phones.[89]\nIn November 2015, an investor group led by Shkreli acquired a majority stake in KaloBios Pharmaceuticals (OTC Pink\u00a0Limited: KBIOQ), a biopharmaceutical company based in South San Francisco, California.[90] Shkreli was named CEO of the company and also planned to continue in the role of CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals.[91][92] After his December 2015 arrest, KaloBios Pharmaceuticals terminated him as CEO.[93] On December 29, 2015, KaloBios filed for Chapter\u00a011 bankruptcy. This followed NASDAQ delisting its shares, and the resignation of two directors.[94]\nShkreli founded G\u00f6del Systems in August 2016 as \"a professional software company that aims to be the leading information provider of data, workflow, and communications solutions for financial, law, and scientific professionals.\" By February 2017, G\u00f6del Systems was looking to raise $1 million through a debt offering, and had raised $50,000 out of the $1 million in debt it began issuing in mid-January 2017, according to regulatory filings. Ralph Holzmann, a former senior engineer at Twitter, is the firm's chief technology officer.\nShkreli was subpoenaed to appear before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives to answer questions about the Daraprim price increase.[11] Shkreli's efforts to quash the subpoena were unsuccessful.[11]\nOn February 4, 2016, Shkreli appeared before the House committee,[95] along with Nancy Retzlaff,[96] the Chief Commercial Officer of Turing, and Howard B. Schiller, the interim CEO of Valeant.[97]\nShkreli followed his lawyer's advice and refused to answer any questions, except to confirm his name[98][99]\u00a0\u2013 including those related to his acquisition of the most expensive music album ever made[100]\u00a0\u2013 by exercising his Fifth Amendment rights.[101]\nOn December 17, 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI after a federal indictment[102] in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York was filed, charging him with securities fraud. The charges were filed after an investigation into his tenure at MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin. He was accused of running a Ponzi-like scheme.[4]\nFederal prosecutors said that Shkreli \"engaged in multiple schemes to ensnare investors through a web of lies and deceit.\"[103][104] In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Shkreli said that he was targeted by law enforcement for his price hikes of the drug Daraprim and his flamboyant personality.[105]\nIn early 2016, Shkreli retained criminal defense attorney Benjamin Brafman to defend him.[106][107] Due to his notoriety and overwhelmingly negative public opinion, it was difficult to select an unbiased jury, with potential jurors stating \"I'm aware of the defendant and I hate him\", \"he kind of looks like a dick\", and \"he disrespected the Wu Tang Clan\".[108] At his 2017 trial, Shkreli argued that none of his investors actually lost money (some actually turned a profit) and thus his actions did not constitute a crime.[109] Shkreli's frequent criticisms of the federal prosecutors in New York's Eastern District, whom he called \"junior varsity\" compared to their counterparts in the Southern District across the East River, both on his Facebook streaming video feed and in the hallways of the courthouse, led those prosecutors to request that judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto issue a gag order to prevent what they called a \"campaign of disruption.\" Brafman claimed in response that his client was responding to baiting from the media and was also suffering from extreme anxiety because of his situation.[110] Matsumoto ordered Shkreli not to speak with reporters, either in the courthouse or its immediate vicinity.[111]\nOn August 4, 2017, the trial jury found Shkreli guilty on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and not guilty on five other counts.[112] Shkreli said he was delighted with the outcome and described his prosecution as \"a witch hunt of epic proportions.\"[113]\nOn September 13, 2017, his bail was revoked following a Facebook post offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair which the judge perceived as solicitation to assault, which is not protected under the First Amendment.[114] Shkreli's post was preceded by others that suggested he might have plans to clone Hillary Clinton.[115] Shkreli said that his post was satire, and his lawyer described it as tasteless but not a threat.[115] Shkreli edited the post to add a disclaimer that it was satire,[116] and later said he did this minutes after publication.[117] Shkreli apologized for the post.[118] He was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn[6] while awaiting sentencing.[118][119]\nShkreli appealed the conviction,[120] but, in 2019, an appeals court unanimously upheld the jury verdict.[121] The original judgment remained in effect; Shkreli must continue to serve his 7-year sentence and forfeit more than $7.3 million in assets. The panel of judges issued the ruling just three weeks after hearing arguments in the appeal, rather than the normal period of months. The ruling was also unusually short, spanning only seven pages.[121][122]\nOn March 5, 2018, Shkreli was ordered to forfeit nearly $7.4 million  in assets.[123] The court ordered that if Shkreli had insufficient cash to fulfill the forfeiture order, his assets\u2014including a piece of art by Pablo Picasso, his unique Wu-Tang album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, the then unreleased Lil Wayne album Tha Carter V, and Shkreli's pharmaceutical company shares\u2014could be seized.[124] In April, he was ordered to pay $388,000 in restitution.[125]\nDuring his sentencing, judge Kiyo Matsumoto said Shkreli seemed \"genuinely remorseful,\" regarding his \"egregious multitude of lies,\" but said he had \"repeatedly minimized\" his misconduct.  Shkreli, who reportedly cried as he gave his statement to the court, stated \"I was never motivated by money.\"[126]\nOn March 9, 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in federal prison.[14][127] He is federal inmate number 87850-053 and was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn prior to being transferred to federal prison.[128]  On March 27, 2018, it was reported that Judge Kiyo Matsumoto agreed to recommend Shkreli serve his prison sentence at the minimum security federal camp at USP Canaan, which he had previously requested.[129][130] On April 18, 2018, Shkreli was transferred from Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn to FCI Fort Dix after his request to serve at USP Canaan was denied.  As of August 2019, Shkreli is serving his sentence at FCC Allenwood.[6]\nSeveral media outlets on 6 September 2019 reported that Shkreli leveled a lawsuit against a former investor into his Elea Capital fund before a Brooklyn court, \"accusing him of fraudulently inducing Shkreli into signing a promissory note that has left him owing $420,000 to the man\u2019s father.\"[131][132]\nIn December 2016, the New York state Department of Taxation and Finance issued a tax warrant for $1.26 million for unpaid taxes owed by Shkreli.   After Shkreli made partial payments, the state recouped another $134,500 from Shkreli by seizing and auctioning off an Enigma machine for $65,000, a manuscript signed by Isaac Newton, a letter from Charles Darwin, and another letter written by English mathematician and writer Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace.\nOn April 23, 2018, it was reported that in court filings New York's attorney general had asked Judge Matsumoto for priority on more than $480,000 in court-ordered forfeitures, to recover additional unpaid taxes and penalties owed to the state, over the federal government's claims for Shkreli's forfeited assets. Prior to Shkreli's conviction, the state of New York had been aggressively attempting to collect the tax debts from Shkreli and had already seized and auctioned off several of items including the rare Nazi Enigma code machine.\nAt the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Shkreli had agreed to an order that would bar him from the securities industry in order to settle a pending SEC administrative action against him, however, Shkreli is eligible to apply for readmission to the industry subject to applicable laws and regulations governing the process.[120]\nIn January 2016, Fortune estimated the then-32-year-old Shkreli's net worth was at least $45 million but later updated its profile to reflect that \"[S]ince this article was published the value of Shkreli's E*Trade account had dropped by more than $40 million\".[133] Shkreli leveraged a $4 million E-Trade account for his bail.[134]\nIn June 2017, Reuters reported that Shkreli had reported his net worth at $70 million after being arrested in 2015 and that his attorney Benjamin Brafman, in a hearing before Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, had conceded that his client still owned shares of Turing Pharmaceuticals worth between $30 to $50 million.[135]\nShkreli, an avid League of Legends player, began expressing interest in purchasing an eSports team in May 2014.[136] Enemy eSports rejected a US$1.2 million offer from Shkreli.[137] He later founded his own team, Odyssey eSports, and aimed to qualify for the 2015 North American League of Legends Challenger Series but the team failed. In August 2015, Odyssey merged with another team to become the organisation Team Imagine, with Shkreli becoming chairman of the team. During the merger, the organization signed the Dota\u00a02 team Leviathan.[138][139]\nShkreli won an auction for the Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin after the single copy of the album was sold via Paddle8 on November 24, 2015, for US$2 million.[100][140] In October 2016, Shkreli claimed on his Twitter that he would release the album for free download if Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election and would destroy the album if Hillary Clinton won.[141] He shared the intro and one track the day after Trump became the president-elect.[142]\nIn September 2017,[143] Shkreli attempted to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin on eBay, with the winning bid passing $1m. He was incarcerated on unrelated fraud counts before the sale could be completed.[144] In March 2018, following Shkreli's conviction for fraud, a federal court seized assets belonging to him worth $7.36m, including Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.[145]\nIn February 2016, he announced in an offer letter $10 million to become the sole owner of Kanye West's album The Life of Pablo.[146][147] On February 12, 2016, Shkreli increased his offer for West's The Life of Pablo from $10 million to $15 million.[148]\nShkreli was formerly a benefactor of Collect Records, a record label run by musician Geoff Rickly, and offered to bail out rapper Bobby Shmurda; Shkreli retracted this offer after his own arrest.[149][150]\n\nIn February 2017, Shkreli was invited to speak at Harvard University. The requested travel was approved by a judge.[151][152][153].mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nWilliam Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, investor, and philanthropist. He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company.[4][a] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect.[7] During the late 1990s, Gates had been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[8] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000.[9] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[10] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[11] Since 1987, he has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest documented individuals.[12][13] From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years.[1] In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6\u00a0billion compared to Gates' net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.[14] As of November\u00a09, 2019[update], Gates had an estimated net worth of US$107.1 billion, making him the second wealthiest person in the world, behind Bezos. Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity.[15] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[16] The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.[17] Gates was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994). His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[18][19] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of America. Gates' maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" (i.e., three) because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[20][21] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[22] Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.[23] When he was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[24][25][26] Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child. He preferred to stay in his room where he would shout \"I'm thinking\" when his mother asked what he was doing.[21] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[27] At 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school,[28] and he wrote his first software program.[29] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students.[30] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.[31] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned for the summer Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates' best friend and first business collaborator Kent Evans after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[32][33][21] The four students had formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.[21] At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business. The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The two friends wrote the school's student information system software to schedule students in classes, and Gates modified the code so that he was placed in classes with \"a disproportionate number of interesting girls.\"[21][34] The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.[21] At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[35] In 1972, he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives.[36][37] He was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[38] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[39][40] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[41] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO years later and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.[42] Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[43] presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years;[43][44] its successor is faster by only 1%.[43] His solution was formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[45] Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard,[46] and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. He remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[47] The MITS Altair 8800 was released the following year based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[48] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.[46] He explained his decision to leave Harvard: \"if things hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave.\"[49] Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[50] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,[51] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\", a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[51] They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.[51] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies. Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[52] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[51] The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington on January 1, 1979.[50] Gates said that he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years. As the company grew he transitioned to a manager role, then an executive.[53] IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[54] IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[55] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.[56] Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC[57] and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of $50,000.[58] Rather than the contract itself, which earned Microsoft a relatively small fee, the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system was the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the World's leading software company. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.[58] They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of MS-DOS (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[59] The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. PC Magazine asked if Gates was \"the man behind the machine?\".[54] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.[50][60] Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside.[21] They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.[61] Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[62] Gates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\"[63] An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor\".[64] Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and the managers described him as being verbally combative. He also berated them for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[65][66] He interrupted presentations with such comments as \"that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard\"[67] and \"why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"[68] The target of his outburst would then have to defend the proposal in detail until Gates was fully convinced.[67] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend.\"[69][70][71] During Microsoft's early years, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[72] but he wrote code that shipped with the company's products as late as 1989.[70] Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when Gates announced Microsoft Excel: \"Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\"[73] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his role at Microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[74] Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\". The judge and observers in the courtroom were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[75] BusinessWeek reported: Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying \"I don't recall\" so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[76] Gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. \"Did I fence with Boies? \u2026 I plead guilty\u2026 rudeness to Boies in the first degree.\"[77] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization, tying and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[77] Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8\u00a0billion to US$78.5\u00a0billion. As of January\u00a02014[update], most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[78] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become \"technology advisor\" alongside CEO Satya Nadella.[11][79] Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: \"...\u00a0there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" Gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"America's way better today than it's ever been.\"[80] Gates has expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that: First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[81][82][83][84] In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would \"highly recommend\" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[85] In March 2018, Gates met at his home in Seattle with Mohammed bin Salman, the reformist crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[86][87] In June 2019, Gates admitted that losing the mobile operating system race to Android was his biggest mistake. He stated that it was within their skill set of being the dominant player, but partially blames the antitrust litigation during the time.[88] That same year, Gates became an Advisory Board Member of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.[89] Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H. Gates Foundation.\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6\u00a0billion.[90][91] The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[92][93] Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009.[94][95] Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[96] As of 2007[update], Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28\u00a0billion to charity;[97] the couple plan to eventually donate 95% of their wealth to charity.[98] The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[99] The foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin A deficiency.[100] The goal of the foundation is to provide 120 million women and girls, in the poorest countries, with high-quality contraceptive information and services, with the longer-term goal of universal access to voluntary family planning.[101] In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries.[102] Although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility,[103] it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[104] In 2014, protests in Vancouver occurred when Gates decided to donate $50 million to UNAIDS through the Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[105][106] Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, who sold their home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in their book, The Power of Half.[107] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates and investor Warren Buffett each signed a commitment they called the \"Giving Pledge\", which is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth, over the course of time, to charity.[108][109][110] Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20\u00a0million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[111] The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[112] Gates also donated $6\u00a0million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[113] Since 2005, Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the \"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\", which has received considerable media interest.[114] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was \"produced from human feces\" in 2014\u00a0\u2013 in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni Processor.[115][116] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[117] In November 2017, Gates said he would give $50\u00a0million to the Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture capital that seeks treatment for Alzheimer's disease. He also pledged an additional $50\u00a0million to start-up ventures working in Alzheimer's research.[118] Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10\u00a0million each as their inheritance. With only $30\u00a0million kept in the family, they are expected to give away about 99.96% of their wealth.[119] On August 25, 2018, Gates distributed $600,000 through his foundation via UNICEF which is helping flood affected victims in Kerala, India.[120] On April 29, 2017, Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer in play in the Match for Africa 4, a noncompetitive tennis match at a sold-out Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[121] Federer and Gates played against John Isner, the top-ranked American player for much of this decade, and Mike McCready, the lead guitarist for Pearl Jam. The pair won the match 6 to 4. Overall, they raised $2\u00a0million for children in Africa.[122] The following year, Gates and Federer returned to play in the Match for Africa 5 on March 5, 2018, at San Jose's SAP Center. Their opponents were Jack Sock, one of the top American players and a grand slam winner in doubles, and Savannah Guthrie, a co-anchor for NBC's Today show. Gates and Federer recorded their second match victory together by a score of 6\u20133 and the event raised over $2.5 million.[123] Gates married Melinda French on a golf course on the Hawaiian island of Lanai on January 1, 1994. They have three children. The family resides in Xanadu 2.0, an earth-sheltered mansion in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington. In 2009, property taxes on the mansion were reported to be US$1.063 million, on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million.[155] The 66,000-square-foot (6,100\u00a0m2) estate has a 60-foot (18\u00a0m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500-square-foot (230\u00a0m2) gym and a 1,000-square-foot (93\u00a0m2) dining room.[156] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith: \"The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.\"[157] Gates also said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm\u00a0\u2013 not all\u00a0\u2013 that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\"[157] Gates purchased the Codex Leicester, a collection of scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci, for US$30.8\u00a0million at an auction in 1994.[158] Gates is an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[159] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[160][161] Gates' days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similar to the U.S. President's schedule.[162] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet. In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed US$101\u00a0billion.[163] [164] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In May 2006, Gates remarked that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[165] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[166][167] Slim retook the position again in June 2014[168][169] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40\u00a0billion to more than US$82\u00a0billion.[170] In October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.[14] On November 15, 2019, he once again became the richest person in the world after a 48% increase in Microsoft shares, surpassing Bezos.[171] Gates told the BBC, \"I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so\u00a0... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes.\"[172] He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.[173] Gates has held the top spot on the list of The World's Billionaires for 18 out of the past 23 years.[174] Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of US$616,667 and US$350,000 bonus totalling US$966,667.[175] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[176] In 2016, he was discussing his gaming habits when he revealed that he was color-blind.[177] Gates has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio with stake in various sectors[178] and has participated in several entrepreneurial ventures beyond Microsoft, including: Gates has written two books: Gates was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on January 31, 2016, in which he talks about his relationships with his father and Steve Jobs, meeting Melinda Ann French, the start of Microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading The Economist \"from cover to cover every week\"). His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: \"Blue Skies\" by Willie Nelson; book: The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker; and luxury item: a DVD Collection of Lectures from The Teaching Company.[185] Gates made a guest appearance as himself on the Emmy Award winning TV show, The Big Bang Theory. The episode on which he appeared was appropriately entitled, \"The Gates Excitation.\"[186]",

He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.\nBorn and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company.[4][a] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect.[7] During the late 1990s, Gates had been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[8] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000.[9] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[10] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[11]\nSince 1987, he has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest documented individuals.[12][13] From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years.[1] In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6\u00a0billion compared to Gates' net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.[14] As of November\u00a09, 2019[update], Gates had an estimated net worth of US$107.1 billion, making him the second wealthiest person in the world, behind Bezos.\nLater in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity.[15] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[16] The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.[17]\nGates was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994). His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[18][19] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of America. Gates' maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" (i.e., three) because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[20][21] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[22] Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.[23] When he was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[24][25][26] Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child. He preferred to stay in his room where he would shout \"I'm thinking\" when his mother asked what he was doing.[21] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[27]\nAt 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school,[28] and he wrote his first software program.[29] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students.[30] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.[31] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned for the summer Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates' best friend and first business collaborator Kent Evans after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[32][33][21]\nThe four students had formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.[21] At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business. The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The two friends wrote the school's student information system software to schedule students in classes, and Gates modified the code so that he was placed in classes with \"a disproportionate number of interesting girls.\"[21][34] The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.[21]\nAt 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[35] In 1972, he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives.[36][37] He was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[38] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[39][40] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[41] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO years later and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.[42]\nGates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[43] presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years;[43][44] its successor is faster by only 1%.[43] His solution was formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[45]\nGates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard,[46] and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. He remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[47] The MITS Altair 8800 was released the following year based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[48] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.[46] He explained his decision to leave Harvard: \"if things hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave.\"[49]\nGates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[50] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen,[51] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\", a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[51] They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.[51] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.\nMicrosoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[52] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[51] The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington on January 1, 1979.[50]\nGates said that he personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that the company produced in its first five years. As the company grew he transitioned to a manager role, then an executive.[53]\nIBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[54] IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[55] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.[56] Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC[57] and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of $50,000.[58]\nRather than the contract itself, which earned Microsoft a relatively small fee, the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system was the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the World's leading software company. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.[58] They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of MS-DOS (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[59] The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. PC Magazine asked if Gates was \"the man behind the machine?\".[54]\nGates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.[50][60] Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside.[21] They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.[61]\nMicrosoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[62]\nGates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\"[63] An Atari executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor\".[64]\nGates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and the managers described him as being verbally combative. He also berated them for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[65][66] He interrupted presentations with such comments as \"that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard\"[67] and \"why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"[68] The target of his outburst would then have to defend the proposal in detail until Gates was fully convinced.[67] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend.\"[69][70][71]\nDuring Microsoft's early years, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[72] but he wrote code that shipped with the company's products as late as 1989.[70] Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when Gates announced Microsoft Excel: \"Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\"[73]\nOn June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his role at Microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[74]\nGates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\". The judge and observers in the courtroom were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[75] BusinessWeek reported:\nEarly rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying \"I don't recall\" so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[76]\nGates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. \"Did I fence with Boies? \u2026 I plead guilty\u2026 rudeness to Boies in the first degree.\"[77] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization, tying and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[77]\nSince leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8\u00a0billion to US$78.5\u00a0billion. As of January\u00a02014[update], most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[78] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become \"technology advisor\" alongside CEO Satya Nadella.[11][79]\nGates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: \"...\u00a0there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" Gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"America's way better today than it's ever been.\"[80]\nGates has expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that:\nFirst the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[81][82][83][84]\nIn a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would \"highly recommend\" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[85] In March 2018, Gates met at his home in Seattle with Mohammed bin Salman, the reformist crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[86][87] In June 2019, Gates admitted that losing the mobile operating system race to Android was his biggest mistake. He stated that it was within their skill set of being the dominant player, but partially blames the antitrust litigation during the time.[88] That same year, Gates became an Advisory Board Member of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.[89]\nGates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H. Gates Foundation.\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6\u00a0billion.[90][91] The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[92][93] Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009.[94][95]\nGates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[96] As of 2007[update], Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28\u00a0billion to charity;[97] the couple plan to eventually donate 95% of their wealth to charity.[98]\nThe foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy &amp; Advocacy Division.[99] The foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin A deficiency.[100] The goal of the foundation is to provide 120 million women and girls, in the poorest countries, with high-quality contraceptive information and services, with the longer-term goal of universal access to voluntary family planning.[101] In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries.[102] Although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility,[103] it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[104] In 2014, protests in Vancouver occurred when Gates decided to donate $50 million to UNAIDS through the Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[105][106]\nMelinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, who sold their home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in their book, The Power of Half.[107] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates and investor Warren Buffett each signed a commitment they called the \"Giving Pledge\", which is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth, over the course of time, to charity.[108][109][110]\nGates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20\u00a0million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[111]\nThe Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[112] Gates also donated $6\u00a0million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[113]\nSince 2005, Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the \"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\", which has received considerable media interest.[114] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was \"produced from human feces\" in 2014\u00a0\u2013 in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni Processor.[115][116] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[117]\nIn November 2017, Gates said he would give $50\u00a0million to the Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture capital that seeks treatment for Alzheimer's disease. He also pledged an additional $50\u00a0million to start-up ventures working in Alzheimer's research.[118] Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10\u00a0million each as their inheritance. With only $30\u00a0million kept in the family, they are expected to give away about 99.96% of their wealth.[119] On August 25, 2018, Gates distributed $600,000 through his foundation via UNICEF which is helping flood affected victims in Kerala, India.[120]\nOn April 29, 2017, Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer in play in the Match for Africa 4, a noncompetitive tennis match at a sold-out Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[121] Federer and Gates played against John Isner, the top-ranked American player for much of this decade, and Mike McCready, the lead guitarist for Pearl Jam. The pair won the match 6 to 4. Overall, they raised $2\u00a0million for children in Africa.[122] The following year, Gates and Federer returned to play in the Match for Africa 5 on March 5, 2018, at San Jose's SAP Center. Their opponents were Jack Sock, one of the top American players and a grand slam winner in doubles, and Savannah Guthrie, a co-anchor for NBC's Today show. Gates and Federer recorded their second match victory together by a score of 6\u20133 and the event raised over $2.5 million.[123]\nGates married Melinda French on a golf course on the Hawaiian island of Lanai on January 1, 1994. They have three children. The family resides in Xanadu 2.0, an earth-sheltered mansion in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington. In 2009, property taxes on the mansion were reported to be US$1.063 million, on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million.[155] The 66,000-square-foot (6,100\u00a0m2) estate has a 60-foot (18\u00a0m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500-square-foot (230\u00a0m2) gym and a 1,000-square-foot (93\u00a0m2) dining room.[156]\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith: \"The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.\"[157]\nGates also said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm\u00a0\u2013 not all\u00a0\u2013 that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\"[157]\nGates purchased the Codex Leicester, a collection of scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci, for US$30.8\u00a0million at an auction in 1994.[158] Gates is an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[159] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[160][161] Gates' days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similar to the U.S. President's schedule.[162] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet.\nIn 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed US$101\u00a0billion.[163] [164] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In May 2006, Gates remarked that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[165] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[166][167] Slim retook the position again in June 2014[168][169] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40\u00a0billion to more than US$82\u00a0billion.[170] In October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.[14] On November 15, 2019, he once again became the richest person in the world after a 48% increase in Microsoft shares, surpassing Bezos.[171] Gates told the BBC, \"I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so\u00a0... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes.\"[172] He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.[173]\nGates has held the top spot on the list of The World's Billionaires for 18 out of the past 23 years.[174] Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of US$616,667 and US$350,000 bonus totalling US$966,667.[175] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[176] In 2016, he was discussing his gaming habits when he revealed that he was color-blind.[177]\nGates has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio with stake in various sectors[178] and has participated in several entrepreneurial ventures beyond Microsoft, including: \nGates has written two books:\nGates was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on January 31, 2016, in which he talks about his relationships with his father and Steve Jobs, meeting Melinda Ann French, the start of Microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading The Economist \"from cover to cover every week\"). His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: \"Blue Skies\" by Willie Nelson; book: The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker; and luxury item: a DVD Collection of Lectures from The Teaching Company.[185]\nGates made a guest appearance as himself on the Emmy Award winning TV show, The Big Bang Theory. The episode on which he appeared was appropriately entitled, \"The Gates Excitation.\"[186]\n\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nElon Reeve Musk FRS (/\u02c8i\u02d0l\u0252n/; born June 28, 1971) is an engineer and technology entrepreneur.[2][3][4] He is a citizen of South Africa, Canada, and the United States (where he resides permanently) and is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer/designer of SpaceX;[5] co-founder, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;[6][7] founder of The Boring Company;[8] co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI.[9] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[10][11] In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People,[12] and was ranked joint first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019.[13] He has a net worth of $44.5 billion and is listed by Forbes as the 23rd-richest person in the world.[1] He is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[14] Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a Bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue an entrepreneurial career. He subsequently co-founded Zip2 with his brother Kimbal, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.[6][15][16][17] In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded,[6] and became its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of SolarCity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain\u2013computer interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company focused on tunnels specialized for electric vehicles. Apart from Tesla, Musk is not an investor in the stock market.[18] In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop, and has proposed a vertical take-off and landing supersonic jet electric aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet.[19] Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.[20] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on Mars.[21][22] Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,[23] the son of Maye Musk (n\u00e9e\u00a0Haldeman), a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[24] and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28] His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.[29][30] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[31][32] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[31] a choice made by Musk two years after his parents separated but which he subsequently regretted.[33] Musk is estranged from his father whom he has referred to as \"a terrible human being\".[33] He has a half-sister[34] and a half-brother.[35] During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[36] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[37] He taught himself computer programming and, by the age of 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[38][39] A web version of the game is available online.[38][40] His childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that \"you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one\".[33] Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost consciousness.[33] The damage to his nose required corrective surgery.[36][41] Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School[41] before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United States, saying \"I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible, more than any other country in the world.\"[42] Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th\u00a0birthday,[43] after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[44][45] Elon Musk, [46] While awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[47] Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[48][49] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage; and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.[50] His work at Rocket Science Games involved assembly programming of device drivers. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple\u2019s QuickTime who had hired Musk noted: \u201cHe had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.\u201d[51] In 1995, Musk commenced a PhD in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California. Eager to pursue opportunities in the Internet boom, he dropped out after just two days to launch his first company, Zip2 Corporation.[52] In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of angel investors.[33] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions and yellow pages.[53][54] The vector graphics mapping and direction code was implemented by Musk in Java.[55] Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune[56] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[57] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[36] Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307\u00a0million in cash[36]:109 and US$34\u00a0million in stock options[citation needed] in February 1999.[58] Musk received US$22\u00a0million for his 7 percent share from the sale.[56][36]:109 In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10\u00a0million from the sale of Zip2.[43][53][57] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[56][59] which had a money-transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service.[60] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.[61] In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5\u00a0billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165\u00a0million.[62] Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.[63] In July 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has sentimental value to him.[64] In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.[65][66] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[67] The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8\u00a0million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[67] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[68] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that, in theory, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed in software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.[69] Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.[70] With US$100\u00a0million of his early fortune,[71] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002.[72] Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of the Hawthorne, California-based company. By 2016, Musk's private trust held 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.[73] SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon).[74] SpaceX designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft over a span of seven years. In September 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit.[36] SpaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for the highest thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket engine (the Merlin 1D).[75][76] SpaceX has produced more than 100 operational Merlin 1D engines. Each Merlin 1D engine can vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars. In combination, the 9 Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 first stage produce anywhere from 5.8 to 6.7\u00a0MN (1.3 to 1.5\u00a0million pounds) of thrust, depending on altitude.[77] In 2006, SpaceX was awarded a contract from NASA to continue the development and test of the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the International Space Station,[78][failed verification] followed by a US$1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services program contract on December 23, 2008, for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station, replacing the US Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011.[79] On May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.[80] Astronaut transport to the ISS is currently handled solely by the Soyuz, but SpaceX is one of two companies awarded a contract by NASA as part of the Commercial Crew Development program, which is currently projected to develop a US astronaut transport capability by 2020.[81] Musk believed the key to making space travel affordable was to make rockets reusable, though space industry experts believed reusable rockets were impossible or infeasible.[82] On December 22, 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad, the first time this had been achieved by an orbital rocket \u2014 a significant step to rocket reusability and lower cost access to space.[83] The first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform,[84] and by the end of 2017, SpaceX had landed and recovered the first stage on 16 consecutive missions where a landing and recovery were attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017. 20 out of 42 first stage Falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the Falcon 9 maiden flight in 2010.[85] In 2017 SpaceX launched 18 successful Falcon 9 flights, more than doubling their highest previous year of 8.[86] On February 6, 2018, SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built (after Saturn V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful rocket in operation as of 2018[update]. The inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to Musk as a dummy payload.[87] SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide global internet coverage, with an initial 60 satellites launched on 24 May 2019. Musk was influenced by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series[88] and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life.[89] Musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species. An asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years, atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball\u2014or go extinct.Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10.[90] In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10\u201320 years.[91] In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000.[37] Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains, Hyperloop, electric aircraft).[92] Musk stated in June 2016 that the first uncrewed flight of the larger Interplanetary Spaceship was aimed for departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed by the first crewed ITS Mars flight departing in 2024.[93] In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his architecture to explore and colonize Mars.[94] In late 2017, SpaceX unveiled the design for its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), that would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities with a single set of very large vehicles: Earth-orbit, Lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth, and totally replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon vehicles in the 2020s. Starship will have a 9-meter (30\u00a0ft) core diameter. Significant development on the vehicles began in 2017, with an initial prototype unveiled in September 2019,[95] while the new rocket engine (Raptor) development began in 2012,[96][97] with a first test flight performed in August 2019.[98] In a September 2018 announcement of a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called #dearMoon project,[99] Musk showed a redesigned concept for the BFR second stage and spaceship with three rear fins and two front canard fins added for atmospheric entry, replacing the previous delta wing and split flaps shown a year earlier. The revised BFR design was to use seven identically-sized Raptor engines in the second stage; the same engine model as would be used on the first stage. The second stage design had two small actuating canard fins near the nose of the ship, and three large fins at the base, two of which would actuate, with all three serving as landing legs.[100] Additionally, SpaceX also stated later that September that they were \"no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability.\"[101] The two major parts of the re-designed BFR were given descriptive names in November: \"Starship\" for the upper stage and \"Super Heavy\" for the booster stage, which Musk pointed out was \"needed to escape Earth's deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons).\"[102] Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[103] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[104] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.[105][106][15][107] All three, along with J. B. Straubel, were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero electric roadster prototype.[108] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[109] Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[82][110] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today. As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[14] Tesla's master plan, as iterated by Musk in 2006[111] was: \"Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options\". Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster, in 2008, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model\u00a0S sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012; however, the Model X launch was delayed until September 2015.[112][113][114] In addition to its own cars, Tesla sold electric powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors in Tesla.[115] Musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the NUMMI plant, now known as the Tesla Factory (Fremont, California) in 2010 Musk and Senator Dianne Feinstein next to a Tesla Model S (2010) Musk standing in front of a Tesla Model S in 2011 Musk favored building a more affordable Tesla model; this led to the Model 3 that was unveiled in 2016, with a planned base price of US$35,000.[111] Initial deliveries began in 2017, with the US$35,000 base model becoming available in February 2019.[116][117] Musk originally intended to name the model 3 as the model E but was blocked by Ford which held the trademark, with Musk concluding that \"Ford was killing SEX\".[118] Several mainstream publications have compared him with Henry Ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.[119] Musk has named the fastest acceleration modes of their vehicles after the Spaceballs' starship speeds (Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed).[120][121] In a May 2013 interview with All Things Digital, Musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars, Tesla planned to expand its network of supercharger stations, tripling the number on the East and West coasts of the U.S. that June, with plans for more expansion across North America, including Canada, throughout the year.[122] In 2014, Musk announced that Tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up the development of electric cars. \"The unfortunate reality is electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn't burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales,\" Musk said.[123] In February 2016, Musk announced that he had acquired the Tesla.com domain name from Stu Grossman, who had owned it since 1992, and changed Tesla's homepage to that domain.[124] Anticipating that the global lithium-ion battery supply was insufficient for their planned electric car output, a lithium-ion battery factory that would more than double existing global output was planned.[125] On July 29, 2016 the first phase of Gigafactory 1, a lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factory, was officially opened near Reno, Nevada, by Tesla in partnership with Panasonic.[126][127] Gigafactory 1 currently produces 35 GWh/yr of batteries. In July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"master plan part 2\"[128]: \"Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments [including small SUV and pickup truck]. Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning. Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it.\" In July 2016, Tesla commenced developing their autopilot hardware and software in-house, ending their previous partnership with Mobileye.[129] In November 2016, SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc.[130] In September 2017, Musk arranged a contract with the government of South Australia for Tesla Energy to install what would then be the world's largest lithium ion battery pack, to help alleviate energy blackouts in the state. Famously, Musk arranged this on twitter, with the guarantee that it would be installed in 100 days or would be free.[131] This deadline was achieved[132] and the resulting battery exceeded expected performance and returns,[133] despite skepticism from Australian federal politicians.[134][135] In September 2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. The lawsuit claimed that verbal discussions Musk held with foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key deal terms[136] and thus characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO on publicly traded companies.[137][138] Musk called the allegations unjustified and that he had never compromised his integrity.[139] Two days later, Musk reached a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down temporarily as Tesla chairman, while remaining Tesla's CEO.[140] Musk also proclaimed in several interviews since that he does not regret sending the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation. According to Reuters, Musk said the tweet was \"Worth It\".[141] According to ABC News, \"As recently as Oct. 4 2018, Musk issued a sarcastic tweet, describing the agency [SEC] as the 'Shortseller Enrichment Commission,' despite having agreed to settlement terms a week earlier that his company, Tesla, would monitor his tweets and other communications.\"[142] In a December 2018 interview with CBS's \u201c60 Minutes\u201d, Musk stated, \"I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC.\"[143] On February 19, 2019, according to Forbes, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.[144] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[145] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[146] In January 2019, Musk traveled to China for the groundbreaking of Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the company's first large-scale plant outside the U.S.[147] Part of his visit to China, Musk also met the Chinese premier Li Keqiang. During their exchange, Musk expressed his admiration for China and wished he could visit China more often, to which the Chinese premier was quoted as saying \"We can issue you a Chinese green card if that helps.\"[148][149] The time from the initial ground-breaking to production of first cars at the Shanghai Gigafactory was achieved in under one year.[150] In March 2019, the model Y small SUV was unveiled.[151] In November 2019, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Cybertruck, an all-electric battery powered pickup truck. The reveal was in Los Angeles\u2014the same month, year and location that the movie Blade Runner, which was a design inspiration, was set in.[152][153] To be manufactured in three variants of Single Motor RWD, Dual Motor AWD and Triple Motor AWD, Cybertruck is expected to start commercial production in late 2021.[154] As of January\u00a029, 2016[update], Musk owned about 28.9\u00a0million Tesla shares, which equates to about 22% of the company.[155][156] As of 2014[update], Musk's annual salary is one dollar, similar to that of Steve Jobs and other CEOs; the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performance-based bonuses.[157][158] In January 2018, Musk was granted an option to buy up to 20.3 million shares if Tesla's market value were to rise to $650 billion. Majority shareholder approval was approved in March 2018.[159] The grant was also meant to end speculation about Musk's potential departure from Tesla to devote more time to his other business ventures.[160] A report by advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. to its clients argued against granting the options.[citation needed][161] Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive.[162][163] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[164] SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc. in November 2016 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla.[130][165][166] The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global warming.[167][168] In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla would collaborate to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program going live in 2013.[169] On June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building a SolarCity advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Musk stated the plant will be \"one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world,\" and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent years.[170] The Tesla Gigafactory 2 is a photovoltaic (PV) cell factory, leased by Tesla subsidiary SolarCity in Buffalo, New York. Construction on the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017.[171] Tesla accepted $750 million in public funds from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as part of the Buffalo Billion project\u2014a plan to invest money to help the economy of the Buffalo, New York area\u2014to build the factory and infrastructure.[172] On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors.[173] The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.[174] After earlier envisioning Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX who worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system.[175][176] An early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[177][178][179] Musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce freestream flow. The document of alpha design estimated the total cost of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at US$6\u00a0billion, but this amount is speculative.[180] In June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015\u20132017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also started building a tunnel.[181] Hyperloop One, a company unaffiliated with Musk, had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its DevLoop track in Nevada on July 13, 2017. It was on May 12, 2017, at 12:02\u00a0a.m. and had lasted 5.3 seconds, reaching a top speed of 70\u00a0mph.[182] On July 20, 2017, Elon Musk announced that he had received verbal government approval to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[183] In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity.[184] By making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to \"counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry.\"[185] Musk has stated he wants to counteract the concentration of power.[33] In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[186] However, in an interview with Joe Rogan in September 2018, Musk warned about the dangers of developing artificial intelligence indiscriminately. In January 2019 Mark Harris of The Guardian noted that on 23 January the Musk foundation \"added a line to its website, stating its support for the \u201cdevelopment of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity\u201d\".[187] In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence. The company is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with computing devices.[188] Musk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: \"OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces.\"[33] On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted \"[I] am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging\u00a0...\" The company was named 'The Boring Company'.[189] On January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted \"Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.\"[190] The first tunnel will start on the SpaceX campus,[191] The Boring Test Tunnel runs underneath West 120th Street. As of January\u00a026, 2017[update], discussions with regulatory bodies had begun.[192] In February 2017, the company began digging a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) wide, 50-foot (15\u00a0m) long, and 15-foot (4.6\u00a0m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of Space X's offices in Los Angeles, since the construction requires no permits.[193][194] Musk had said in early 2017 that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring cost per mile is necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel network.[195] The tunnel width is optimized for electric vehicles only, which avoids complications of exhaust venting with internal combustion engines.[196] By late 2018, TBC had active construction, approved plans in place, or an operational tunnel in several areas of the United States: Baltimore,[197] Chicago[198] and Los Angeles. TBC provided an update on the state of their technology and product line when they opened to the public their first mile-long test tunnel in Hawthorne, California, on 18 December 2018, saying it has been a proof-of-concept for the technology.[199][200] TBC has claimed that design is complete for their next TBM, Prufrock, and that assembly and engineering testing would begin in 2019[199]:15:18\u201315:45 but there have been no announcements of such testing beginning by the end of 2019. As merchandising, the company sold 20,000 \"flamethrowers\" in 2018 [201][202], inspired by the movie Spaceballs.[203] After a string of negative press targeting Tesla caused Musk to become frustrated,[204] specifically articles published by Reveal News criticizing Tesla for its factory safety procedures,[205] Musk announced on Twitter that he is planning on creating a website where users could rate the truthfulness of specific articles in addition to the credibility of journalists and publications.[206] He suggested calling it \"Pravda\" after a Soviet Union-era Communist Party newspaper of the same name. This caused backlash from many journalists, claiming that a platform where any user could freely vote on an article's or a journalist's credibility could be prone to abuse.[207][208] After realizing the site \"pravda.com\" is used by the Ukrainian Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda, Musk bought the site pravduh.com on May 25, 2018.[209] In July 2018, Musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers during the Tham Luang cave rescue by arranging for his employees to build a small rescue pod. Musk, responding to requests for help from Twitter users,[210] contacted the Thai government.[211] He then arranged for engineers from two of his companies to design a child-sized submarine to help the rescue effort and documented the process via Twitter.[212][213] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, also urged Musk to continue construction of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[214] Engineers at Musk's companies SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine out of a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube[215] in 8 hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[216] Named \"Wild Boar\" after the children's soccer team,[217] its design, based on dive team feedback, was a five-foot (1.5\u00a0m)-long, twelve-inch (300\u00a0mm)-inch wide sealed tube weighing about 90 pounds (41\u00a0kg) propelled manually by divers in the front and back with segmented compartments to place diver weights to adjust buoyancy[216][218], intended to solve the problem of safely transporting the children who might have had difficulty learning the scuba skills required to exit the cave on their own without panicking. In case the mini-submarine could not fit through the cave system, Elon Musk also requested Wing Inflatables, a California-based inflatable boat manufacturer, to build inflatable escape pods. The pods were designed, fabricated, and tested in one day before being flown to Thailand.[219][220] By this time, eight of the twelve children had already been rescued (using full face masks and oxygen under anesthesia[221][222][223]) and Thai authorities decided not to use the submarine.[224][225][226] Elon Musk was later awarded a Member of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn by the King of Thailand in March 2019 for his and his team's contributions to the rescue mission.[227][228] The supervisor of the rescue operation Narongsak Osatanakorn stated that the submarine was \"technologically sophisticated, [but] it doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave\".[229][230] Vernon Unsworth, a recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the past six years and who had played a key advisory role in the rescue, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\"[231][232][233] and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as \"pedo guy\", causing backlash against Musk.[234][235] He subsequently deleted the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device, \"Stay tuned jackass.\"[235] On 16 July, Unsworth stated that he was considering legal action in relation to Musk's comments.[236][237] Two days later, Musk issued an apology for his remarks.[238][239][240][241] On 28 August 2018, in response to criticism from a writer on Twitter, Musk tweeted \"You don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me?\"[242] The following day, a letter from L.\u00a0Lin Wood, the rescuer's attorney, dated 6 August, emerged, showing that he had been making preparations for a libel lawsuit.[243][244] At some point, a self-proclaimed private investigator emailed Musk with an offer to \"dig deep\" into Unsworth's past, which Musk accepted in August 2018;[245] the investigator was later revealed to be a convicted felon with multiple counts of fraud.[246] On 30 August, using details produced during the alleged investigation,[247][248] Musk sent a BuzzFeed News reporter who had written about the controversy an email prefaced \"off the record\". It claimed that Unsworth is a \"single white guy from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years ... until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time\" (later stated by Unsworth's partner to be false). On 5 September, the reporter tweeted a screenshot of the email, saying that \"Off the record is a two-party agreement,\" which he \"did not agree to\".[249] In mid-September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles federal court.[250][251] In his defense, Musk has argued that in slang usage \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor.\" (The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang defines the term \"pedo\" as \"an unpleasant or unfortunate person ... adopted as an all-purpose insult....\")[252][253] The defamation case began on December 4, 2019, in Los Angeles, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.[254] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the initial tweet. On December 6 the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable; Musk commented: \"My faith in humanity is restored.\"[255] Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, stated: \"The truth vindicated Musk and Unsworth. Our system of justice worked\".[256] Musk first mentioned Teslaquila in an April Fools tweet in 2018.[257] The proposed Tesla-branded tequila appeared to become closer to reality in October 2018 as Tesla filed an \"intent to use\" trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[258] The trademark is for distilled agave liquor. Musk reaffirmed his intention to release the product with a tweet, featuring a mockup of the bottle, on October 12.[259] Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) has publicly denounced the proposed product, arguing, \"If it wants to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila producer, comply with certain standards and request authorization from Mexico's Industrial Property Institute.\"[260] On March 30, 2019, Musk released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud under the name \"Emo G Records\".[261] The track was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.[262][263] On January 30, 2020, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[264] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable ... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on Soundcloud\",[265] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[264] Politically, Musk has described himself as \"half Democrat, half Republican\" and \"I'm somewhere in the middle, socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"[266] In 2018, he stated that he was \"not a conservative. I'm registered independent [and] politically moderate.\"[267] Prompted by the emergence of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, Musk has voiced support for a universal basic income;[268] he additionally backs direct democracy.[269] He has described himself as a socialist, but \"not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm\" \u2013 arguing instead, \"true socialism seeks greatest good for all.\"[270] He supports targeting an inclusive tax rate of 40%, prefers consumption taxes to income taxes, and supports the estate tax, as the \"probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.\"[271] Musk has described the United States as \"[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth,\" describing it as \"the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been.\" Musk believes democracy would not exist any longer if not for the United States, saying that it prevented this disappearance on three occasions through its participation in World War I, World War II and the Cold War. Musk also stated that he thinks \"it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the United States has done.\"[272] Before the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Musk criticized candidate Trump by saying: \"I feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\"[273] Following Donald Trump's inauguration, Musk expressed approval of Trump's choice of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising President Trump. Regarding his cooperation with Trump, Musk has subsequently commented: \"The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better.\"[274] He subsequently resigned from both in June 2017, in protest at Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, stating: \"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world\".[275][276] In August 2019, Musk came out on Twitter in support of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, whose platform revolves around the ongoing problem of job displacement through technological automation and artificial intelligence. Musk said in a tweet that universal basic income, which Yang supports, is \"obviously needed.\"[277] In an interview with The Washington Post, Musk stated he was a \"significant (though not top-tier) donor to Democrats,\" but that he also gives heavily to Republicans. Musk further stated that political contributions are a requirement in order to have a voice in the United States government.[278][279] A 2012 report from the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending, found that since 2002, SpaceX had spent more US$4\u00a0million on lobbying the United States Congress and more than US$800,000 in political contributions to Democrats and Republicans. The same report said that \"SpaceX's campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated,\" and that \"unlike most tech-startups, SpaceX has maintained a significant lobbying presence in Washington almost since day\u00a01.\" and that \"Musk himself has donated roughly US$725,000 to various campaigns since 2002. In 2004, he contributed US$2,000 to President George W. Bush's reelection campaign, maxing out (over US$100,000)[280] to Barack Obama's reelection campaign and donated US$5,000 to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who represents Florida, a state critical to the space industry. (...) All told, Musk and SpaceX gave out roughly US$250,000 in the 2012 election cycle.\"[278][281] Additionally, SpaceX hired former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to represent the company, via the Washington-based lobbying group Patton Boggs LLP. Alongside Patton Boggs LLP, SpaceX uses several other outside lobbying firms, who work with SpaceX's own lobbyists.[282] Musk had been a supporter of the U.S. political action committee (PAC) FWD.us, which was started by fellow high-profile entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform. However, in May 2013, Musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the PAC was running that supported causes like the Keystone Pipeline. Musk and other members, including David O. Sacks, pulled out, criticizing the strategy as \"cynical.\"[283] Musk further stated, \"We shouldn't give in to the politics. If we give in to that, we'll get the political system we deserve.\"[284] In December 2013, Sean Becker of the media/political website Mic called Musk a \"complete hypocrite,\" stating that \"[for] the 2014 election cycle, Musk has contributed to the Longhorn PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2013 both of which have funded the campaigns of anti-science, anti-environment candidates such as Rep. Michelle Bachman (R-Minn.).\"[284] Musk has directly contributed to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change.[281] Musk has stated that he does not believe the U.S. government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage poor behavior. Musk says that the free market would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.[285] Musk's statements have been widely criticized, with Stanford University Professor Fred Turner noting that \"if you're an entrepreneur like Elon Musk, you will take the money where you can get it, but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that it's entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change, not the state. It is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received. And this goes on all the time in Silicon Valley.\"[286] Author Michael Shellenberger argued that \"in the case of Musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness. And I think there is a business reason for it. They are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent.\" Shellenberger continues, \"we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble.\" While journalist and author Jim Motavalli, who interviewed Musk for High Voltage, his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that \"Elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money \u2013 I do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them.\"[287] In 2015, Musk's statements were subject to further scrutiny when an LA Times article claimed that SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated US$4.9\u00a0billion in government subsidies over twenty years. One example given is New York state, which is spending $750\u00a0million to build a solar panel factory in Buffalo which will be leased to SolarCity for $1 a year. The deal also includes no property taxes for a decade, an estimated $260\u00a0million valuation. Musk employs a former U.S. State Department official as the chief negotiator for Tesla.[288] When asked whether he believed \"there was some kind of destiny involved\" in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than \"just physics\", Musk responded: Well, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably not because then you have to say: \"Where does the master intelligence come from?\" So it sort of begs the question. So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know it's complex phenomenon from simple elements.[289]Musk has stated that he does not pray, or worship any being, although he asked \"any entities that [were] listening\" to \"bless [the] launch\" before an important Falcon 1 launch. When asked whether he thought science and religion could co-exist, Musk replied \"Probably not.\"[290] Although Musk believes there could be simple life on other planets, he is unsure whether other intelligent life is likely.[290] Musk later said that he \"hope[s] that there is other intelligent life in the known universe\", and stated that it is \"probably more likely than not, but that's a complete guess.\"[291] Musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the Fermi paradox: The absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation ... Like when you're playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars in the background, but you can't ever get there. If it's not a simulation, then maybe we're in a lab and there's some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop, out of curiosity, like mould in a Petri dish ... If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilizations, and I mean strange in a bad way. ... And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilizations.[292]Musk has frequently spoken about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, calling it \"the most serious threat to the survival of the human race\". During a 2014 interview at the MIT AeroAstro Centennial Symposium, Musk described AI as humanity's largest existential threat, further stating, \"I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish.\" Musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as \"summoning the demon\".[293][294] Despite this, Musk invested in DeepMind, an AI firm, and Vicarious, a company working to improve machine intelligence.[295] In January 2015, he donated $10\u00a0million to the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies.[296] He was previously the co-chairman of OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.[297] Musk has said that his investments are \"not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return... I like to just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence. I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there. There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator. There are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.\"[295] In June 2016, Musk was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation, to which he answered: The strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation I think is the following: 40 years ago we had Pong \u2013 two rectangles and a dot. That's where we were. Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year. And soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable.[298]Musk's warnings about artificial intelligence have brought him some controversy. He and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg have clashed, with the latter calling his warnings \"pretty irresponsible\".[299] Musk responded to Zuckerberg's censure by saying that he had discussed AI with Zuckerberg and found him to have only a limited understanding of the subject. In 2014, Slate's Adam Elkus argued that current AIs were as intelligent as a toddler, and only in certain fields, going on to say that Musk's \"summoning the demon\" analogy may be harmful because it could result in significant cuts to AI research budgets.[300] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington D.C. think-tank, awarded its Annual Luddite Award to \"alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse\"; its president, Robert D. Atkinson, complained that Musk and others say AI is the largest existential threat to humanity. Atkinson stated \"That's not a very winning message if you want to get AI funding out of Congress to the National Science Foundation.\"[301][302][303] Nature sharply disagreed with the ITIF in an April 2016 editorial, siding instead with Musk, and concluding: \"It is crucial that progress in technology is matched by solid, well-funded research to anticipate the scenarios it could bring about ... If that is a Luddite perspective, then so be it.\"[304] In a 2015 Washington Post editorial, researcher Murray Shanahan stated that human-level AI is unlikely to arrive in the near future, but that nevertheless \"the time to start thinking through the consequences is now.\"[305] At a Tesla event on the sidelines of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems in December 2017, Musk stated that: I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where [sic] you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end? And it doesn't go all the time. ... It's a pain in the ass. That's why everyone doesn't like it. And there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.[306]Afterwards, he dismissed an audience member's response that public transportation functioned effectively in Japan.[307][308] His comment sparked widespread criticism from both the public and transit experts. Urban planning expert Brent Toderian started the hashtag #GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit which was widely adopted by Twitter users in order to dispel Musk's notion that everybody hated public transport.[307][309][310] Yonah Freemark, an urbanist and journalist specializing in planning and transportation, summarized Musk's views on public transport as \"It's terrible. You might be killed. Japanese trains are awful. Individualized transport for everyone! Congestion? Induced demand? Climate change impacts? Unwalkable streets? Who cares!\"[306] Jarrett Walker, a known public transport expert and consultant from Portland, said that \"Musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford\", referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferences\u00a0of a minority yields\u00a0an outcome that usually does not work for the majority.[311][312][313] Musk responded with \"You're an idiot\", later saying \"Sorry ... Meant to say 'sanctimonious idiot'.\"[314][315][316] The exchange received a significant amount of media attention and prompted Nobel laureate Paul Krugman to comment on the controversy, saying that \"You're an idiot\" is \"Elon Musk's idea of a cogent argument\".[311][317] Musk is chairman of the Musk Foundation, which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well as other goals.[318] In 2010, the Musk Foundation collaborated with SolarCity to donate a 25 kW solar power system to the South Bay Community Alliance's hurricane response center in Coden, Alabama.[319] In July 2011, the Musk Foundation donated US$250,000 towards a solar power project in S\u014dma, Japan, a city that had been recently devastated by a tsunami.[320] In July 2014, Musk was asked by cartoonist Matthew Inman and William Terbo, the grandnephew of Nikola Tesla, to donate US$8\u00a0million toward the construction of the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.[321] Ultimately, Musk agreed to donate US$1\u00a0million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a Tesla Supercharger in the museum car park.[322] Musk donated US$10\u00a0million to the Future of Life Institute in January 2015, to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity.[323][296][324] As of 2015[update], Musk is a trustee of the X Prize Foundation[325] and a signatory of The Giving Pledge.[326] In October 2018, in an effort to help solve the Flint water crisis, Musk and the Musk Foundation donated over $480,000 to install new water fountains with filtration systems for access to clean water at all Flint, Michigan schools.[327] As of 2019, approximately 30,000 children in all 12 area schools have safe drinking water freely available from the water filtration systems.[328] Musk has also been a top donor for the ACLU.[329] In October 2019, Musk donated US$1\u00a0million to '#TeamTrees' tree planting initiative led by the YouTube community[note 1] and in collaboration with Arbor Day Foundation.[330][331][332] Tosca Musk, Elon's sister, is a filmmaker. She is the founder of Musk Entertainment and has produced various movies.[333] Musk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while both were students at Ontario's Queen's University. They married in 2000 and separated in 2008.[334] Their first son, Nevada Alexander Musk, died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.[335] They later had five sons through in vitro fertilization[336] \u2013 twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006. They share custody of all five sons.[337] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley, and in 2010, the couple married. In January 2012, Musk announced that he had ended his four-year relationship with Riley,[27][338] tweeting to Riley, \"It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy one day.\"[339] In July 2013, Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, Musk filed for a second divorce from Riley; however, the action was withdrawn.[340] The media announced in March 2016 that divorce proceedings were again under way, this time with Riley filing for divorce from Musk.[341][342] The divorce was finalized in late 2016.[343] Musk began dating American actress Amber Heard in 2016 but the two split up after one year due to their conflicting schedules.[344][345] On May 7, 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they had begun dating.[346][347][348] On January 8, 2020, Grimes announced she was pregnant. The baby's father is assumed to be Musk, although this was not announced.[349][350] On 6 September 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. Within five days, the appearance had accrued 10 million YouTube views.[351] One of the highest profile and controversial aspects of the program was Musk's sampling a single puff from a cigar consisting, Rogan claimed, of tobacco laced with cannabis. To Rogan's inquiry on how often he smoked cannabis, Musk replied: \"Almost never. I know a lot of people like weed and that's fine, but I don't find that is very good for productivity... not for me.\" The Washington Post observed, \"In the media's hands, it became a story about Musk's growing instability\u00a0...\"[352] Tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the departure of Tesla's Vice President of Worldwide Finance earlier that day.[353] Fortune wondered if the cannabis use could have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States Air Force, though a USAF spokesperson told The Verge that there was no investigation being carried out and that the Air Force is still processing the situation.[354][355] In an interview on 60 Minutes, Musk said of the cannabis-smoking incident: \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[356] In Iron Man 2 (2010), Musk met Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in a restaurant, and had some brief lines regarding an \"idea for an electric jet.\"[381] In January 2015, Musk made a guest appearance playing himself on The Simpsons in an episode titled \"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\"; the episode poked fun at many of Musk's ideas.[382] In November 2015, Musk appeared in an episode of The Big Bang Theory, as himself volunteering at a soup kitchen with Wolowitz.[383] Musk also appeared as himself in a November 2017 of The Big Bang Theory spin-off prequel series Young Sheldon. The successful first landing of a SpaceX Falcon\u00a09 first stage on a drone ship is shown being covered by CNN. This is followed by a scene of Musk alone in his office with the notebook that young Sheldon mailed NASA in 1989 containing calculations detailing how this feat could be accomplished.[384] Musk was featured in the 2015 environmental documentary Racing Extinction, in which a custom Tesla Model S was designed to help project images of critically endangered species onto public buildings, including the Empire State Building and the Vatican.[385] Musk appeared in several episodes of South Park including the episode \"Members Only\", November 2016, which was voiced by himself. In 2016, Musk appeared as himself in the romantic comedy film Why Him? where he was briefly met by one of the main characters, Ned Flemming played by Bryan Cranston, in a bar at a party.[386] In December 2016, Robby in New Girl refers to saving a life, and when asked who, responds \"Do you know who Elon Musk is?\".[387] Also in 2016, Musk was referenced by Dr. Martin Stein on The CW time-travel TV show DC's Legends of Tomorrow. During time travel to the past, Stein meets his younger self and introduced himself as Elon Musk, to disguise his own identity.[388] In October 2017, Musk was mentioned as a historic pioneer on the CBS All Access series Star Trek: Discovery. Set in the year 2256, Captain Gabriel Lorca attempts to motivate a scientist on his ship by asking him \"How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright Brothers, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane? Or as a failed fungus expert. A selfish little man who put the survival of his own ego before the lives of others?\"[389][390] According to a TechCrunch article published the day after the episode aired, this mention is \"also interesting because of its notable omission of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos: This other space entrepreneur is such a big fan of Star Trek that he pitched and succeeded in landing a cameo in Star Trek Beyond as an alien being, but he doesn't rate a mention from Lorca among the spaceflight pantheon.\"[391] In February 2019, Musk co-hosted YouTuber PewDiePie's show \"Meme Review\" with Justin Roiland at the request of PewDiePie's fans.[392][393] In October of the same year, Musk voiced an alternate reality version of himself with tusks, known as \"Elon Tusk\", in the season four Rick and Morty episode \"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\".[394]",

He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a Bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue an entrepreneurial career. He subsequently co-founded Zip2 with his brother Kimbal, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.[6][15][16][17]\nIn May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded,[6] and became its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of SolarCity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain\u2013computer interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company focused on tunnels specialized for electric vehicles.\nApart from Tesla, Musk is not an investor in the stock market.[18] In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop, and has proposed a vertical take-off and landing supersonic jet electric aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet.[19] Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.[20] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on Mars.[21][22]\nMusk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,[23] the son of Maye Musk (n\u00e9e\u00a0Haldeman), a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[24] and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28] His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.[29][30] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[31][32] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[31] a choice made by Musk two years after his parents separated but which he subsequently regretted.[33] Musk is estranged from his father whom he has referred to as \"a terrible human being\".[33] He has a half-sister[34] and a half-brother.[35]\nDuring his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[36] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[37] He taught himself computer programming and, by the age of 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[38][39] A web version of the game is available online.[38][40]\nHis childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that \"you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one\".[33]\nMusk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost consciousness.[33] The damage to his nose required corrective surgery.[36][41]\nMusk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School[41] before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United States, saying \"I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible, more than any other country in the world.\"[42] Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th\u00a0birthday,[43] after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[44][45]\nElon Musk, [46]\nWhile awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[47] Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[48][49]\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage; and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.[50] His work at Rocket Science Games involved assembly programming of device drivers. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple\u2019s QuickTime who had hired Musk noted: \u201cHe had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.\u201d[51]\nIn 1995, Musk commenced a PhD in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California. Eager to pursue opportunities in the Internet boom, he dropped out after just two days to launch his first company, Zip2 Corporation.[52]\nIn 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of angel investors.[33]\nThe company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions and yellow pages.[53][54] The vector graphics mapping and direction code was implemented by Musk in Java.[55] Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune[56] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[57] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[36] Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307\u00a0million in cash[36]:109 and US$34\u00a0million in stock options[citation needed] in February 1999.[58] Musk received US$22\u00a0million for his 7 percent share from the sale.[56][36]:109\nIn March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10\u00a0million from the sale of Zip2.[43][53][57] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[56][59] which had a money-transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service.[60] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.[61] In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5\u00a0billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165\u00a0million.[62] Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.[63]\nIn July 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has sentimental value to him.[64]\nIn 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.[65][66] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[67] The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8\u00a0million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[67] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[68] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that, in theory, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed in software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.[69] Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.[70]\nWith US$100\u00a0million of his early fortune,[71] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002.[72] Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of the Hawthorne, California-based company. By 2016, Musk's private trust held 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.[73]\nSpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon).[74] SpaceX designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft over a span of seven years. In September 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit.[36]\nSpaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for the highest thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket engine (the Merlin 1D).[75][76] SpaceX has produced more than 100 operational Merlin 1D engines. Each Merlin 1D engine can vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars. In combination, the 9 Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 first stage produce anywhere from 5.8 to 6.7\u00a0MN (1.3 to 1.5\u00a0million pounds) of thrust, depending on altitude.[77]\nIn 2006, SpaceX was awarded a contract from NASA to continue the development and test of the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the International Space Station,[78][failed verification] followed by a US$1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services program contract on December 23, 2008, for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station, replacing the US Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011.[79]\nOn May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.[80]\nAstronaut transport to the ISS is currently handled solely by the Soyuz, but SpaceX is one of two companies awarded a contract by NASA as part of the Commercial Crew Development program, which is currently projected to develop a US astronaut transport capability by 2020.[81]\nMusk believed the key to making space travel affordable was to make rockets reusable, though space industry experts believed reusable rockets were impossible or infeasible.[82] On December 22, 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad, the first time this had been achieved by an orbital rocket \u2014 a significant step to rocket reusability and lower cost access to space.[83] The first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform,[84] and by the end of 2017, SpaceX had landed and recovered the first stage on 16 consecutive missions where a landing and recovery were attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017. 20 out of 42 first stage Falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the Falcon 9 maiden flight in 2010.[85]\nIn 2017 SpaceX launched 18 successful Falcon 9 flights, more than doubling their highest previous year of 8.[86]\nOn February 6, 2018, SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built (after Saturn V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful rocket in operation as of 2018[update]. The inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to Musk as a dummy payload.[87]\nSpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide global internet coverage, with an initial 60 satellites launched on 24 May 2019.\nMusk was influenced by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series[88] and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life.[89] Musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species.\nAn asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years, atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball\u2014or go extinct.Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10.[90] In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10\u201320 years.[91] In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000.[37] Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains, Hyperloop, electric aircraft).[92] Musk stated in June 2016 that the first uncrewed flight of the larger Interplanetary Spaceship was aimed for departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed by the first crewed ITS Mars flight departing in 2024.[93] In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his architecture to explore and colonize Mars.[94]\nIn late 2017, SpaceX unveiled the design for its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), that would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities with a single set of very large vehicles: Earth-orbit, Lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth, and totally replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon vehicles in the 2020s. Starship will have a 9-meter (30\u00a0ft) core diameter. Significant development on the vehicles began in 2017, with an initial prototype unveiled in September 2019,[95] while the new rocket engine (Raptor) development began in 2012,[96][97] with a first test flight performed in August 2019.[98]\nIn a September 2018 announcement of a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called #dearMoon project,[99] Musk showed a redesigned concept for the BFR second stage and spaceship with three rear fins and two front canard fins added for atmospheric entry, replacing the previous delta wing and split flaps shown a year earlier. The revised BFR design was to use seven identically-sized Raptor engines in the second stage; the same engine model as would be used on the first stage. The second stage design had two small actuating canard fins near the nose of the ship, and three large fins at the base, two of which would actuate, with all three serving as landing legs.[100] Additionally, SpaceX also stated later that September that they were \"no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability.\"[101] The two major parts of the re-designed BFR were given descriptive names in November: \"Starship\" for the upper stage and \"Super Heavy\" for the booster stage, which Musk pointed out was \"needed to escape Earth's deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons).\"[102]\nTesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[103]\nBoth men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[104] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.[105][106][15][107] All three, along with J. B. Straubel, were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero electric roadster prototype.[108] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[109] Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[82][110] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today. As of 2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[14]\nTesla's master plan, as iterated by Musk in 2006[111] was: \"Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options\".\nTesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster, in 2008, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model\u00a0S sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012; however, the Model X launch was delayed until September 2015.[112][113][114] In addition to its own cars, Tesla sold electric powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors in Tesla.[115]\nMusk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of the NUMMI plant, now known as the Tesla Factory (Fremont, California) in 2010\nMusk and Senator Dianne Feinstein next to a Tesla Model S (2010)\nMusk standing in front of a Tesla Model S in 2011\nMusk favored building a more affordable Tesla model; this led to the Model 3 that was unveiled in 2016, with a planned base price of US$35,000.[111] Initial deliveries began in 2017, with the US$35,000 base model becoming available in February 2019.[116][117] Musk originally intended to name the model 3 as the model E but was blocked by Ford which held the trademark, with Musk concluding that \"Ford was killing SEX\".[118]\nSeveral mainstream publications have compared him with Henry Ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.[119]\nMusk has named the fastest acceleration modes of their vehicles after the Spaceballs' starship speeds (Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed).[120][121]\nIn a May 2013 interview with All Things Digital, Musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars, Tesla planned to expand its network of supercharger stations, tripling the number on the East and West coasts of the U.S. that June, with plans for more expansion across North America, including Canada, throughout the year.[122]\nIn 2014, Musk announced that Tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up the development of electric cars. \"The unfortunate reality is electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn't burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales,\" Musk said.[123]\nIn February 2016, Musk announced that he had acquired the Tesla.com domain name from Stu Grossman, who had owned it since 1992, and changed Tesla's homepage to that domain.[124]\nAnticipating that the global lithium-ion battery supply was insufficient for their planned electric car output, a lithium-ion battery factory that would more than double existing global output was planned.[125] On July 29, 2016 the first phase of Gigafactory 1, a lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factory, was officially opened near Reno, Nevada, by Tesla in partnership with Panasonic.[126][127] Gigafactory 1 currently produces 35 GWh/yr of batteries.\nIn July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"master plan part 2\"[128]: \"Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments [including small SUV and pickup truck]. Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning. Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it.\"\nIn July 2016, Tesla commenced developing their autopilot hardware and software in-house, ending their previous partnership with Mobileye.[129]\nIn November 2016, SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc.[130]\nIn September 2017, Musk arranged a contract with the government of South Australia for Tesla Energy to install what would then be the world's largest lithium ion battery pack, to help alleviate energy blackouts in the state. Famously, Musk arranged this on twitter, with the guarantee that it would be installed in 100 days or would be free.[131] This deadline was achieved[132] and the resulting battery exceeded expected performance and returns,[133] despite skepticism from Australian federal politicians.[134][135]\nIn September 2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. The lawsuit claimed that verbal discussions Musk held with foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key deal terms[136] and thus characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO on publicly traded companies.[137][138] Musk called the allegations unjustified and that he had never compromised his integrity.[139] Two days later, Musk reached a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down temporarily as Tesla chairman, while remaining Tesla's CEO.[140] Musk also proclaimed in several interviews since that he does not regret sending the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation. According to Reuters, Musk said the tweet was \"Worth It\".[141] According to ABC News, \"As recently as Oct. 4 2018, Musk issued a sarcastic tweet, describing the agency [SEC] as the 'Shortseller Enrichment Commission,' despite having agreed to settlement terms a week earlier that his company, Tesla, would monitor his tweets and other communications.\"[142]\nIn a December 2018 interview with CBS's \u201c60 Minutes\u201d, Musk stated, \"I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC.\"[143]\nOn February 19, 2019, according to Forbes, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.[144]\nThe SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[145] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[146]\nIn January 2019, Musk traveled to China for the groundbreaking of Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the company's first large-scale plant outside the U.S.[147] Part of his visit to China, Musk also met the Chinese premier Li Keqiang. During their exchange, Musk expressed his admiration for China and wished he could visit China more often, to which the Chinese premier was quoted as saying \"We can issue you a Chinese green card if that helps.\"[148][149] The time from the initial ground-breaking to production of first cars at the Shanghai Gigafactory was achieved in under one year.[150]\nIn March 2019, the model Y small SUV was unveiled.[151]\nIn November 2019, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Cybertruck, an all-electric battery powered pickup truck. The reveal was in Los Angeles\u2014the same month, year and location that the movie Blade Runner, which was a design inspiration, was set in.[152][153] To be manufactured in three variants of Single Motor RWD, Dual Motor AWD and Triple Motor AWD, Cybertruck is expected to start commercial production in late 2021.[154]\nAs of January\u00a029, 2016[update], Musk owned about 28.9\u00a0million Tesla shares, which equates to about 22% of the company.[155][156]\nAs of 2014[update], Musk's annual salary is one dollar, similar to that of Steve Jobs and other CEOs; the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performance-based bonuses.[157][158] In January 2018, Musk was granted an option to buy up to 20.3 million shares if Tesla's market value were to rise to $650 billion. Majority shareholder approval was approved in March 2018.[159] The grant was also meant to end speculation about Musk's potential departure from Tesla to devote more time to his other business ventures.[160] A report by advisory firm Glass Lewis &amp; Co. to its clients argued against granting the options.[citation needed][161]\nMusk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive.[162][163] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[164] SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc. in November 2016 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla.[130][165][166]\nThe underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global warming.[167][168] In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla would collaborate to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program going live in 2013.[169]\nOn June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building a SolarCity advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Musk stated the plant will be \"one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world,\" and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent years.[170] The Tesla Gigafactory 2 is a photovoltaic (PV) cell factory, leased by Tesla subsidiary SolarCity in Buffalo, New York. Construction on the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017.[171] Tesla accepted $750 million in public funds from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as part of the Buffalo Billion project\u2014a plan to invest money to help the economy of the Buffalo, New York area\u2014to build the factory and infrastructure.[172]\nOn August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors.[173] The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.[174]\nAfter earlier envisioning Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX who worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system.[175][176] An early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[177][178][179] Musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce freestream flow. The document of alpha design estimated the total cost of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at US$6\u00a0billion, but this amount is speculative.[180]\nIn June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015\u20132017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also started building a tunnel.[181]\nHyperloop One, a company unaffiliated with Musk, had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its DevLoop track in Nevada on July 13, 2017. It was on May 12, 2017, at 12:02\u00a0a.m. and had lasted 5.3 seconds, reaching a top speed of 70\u00a0mph.[182]\nOn July 20, 2017, Elon Musk announced that he had received verbal government approval to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[183]\nIn December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity.[184]\nBy making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to \"counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry.\"[185] Musk has stated he wants to counteract the concentration of power.[33] In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[186]\nHowever, in an interview with Joe Rogan in September 2018, Musk warned about the dangers of developing artificial intelligence indiscriminately. In January 2019 Mark Harris of The Guardian noted that on 23 January the Musk foundation \"added a line to its website, stating its support for the \u201cdevelopment of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity\u201d\".[187]\nIn 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence. The company is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with computing devices.[188]\nMusk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: \"OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces.\"[33]\nOn December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted \"[I] am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging\u00a0...\" The company was named 'The Boring Company'.[189] On January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted \"Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.\"[190] The first tunnel will start on the SpaceX campus,[191] The Boring Test Tunnel runs underneath West 120th Street. As of January\u00a026, 2017[update], discussions with regulatory bodies had begun.[192]\nIn February 2017, the company began digging a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) wide, 50-foot (15\u00a0m) long, and 15-foot (4.6\u00a0m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of Space X's offices in Los Angeles, since the construction requires no permits.[193][194] Musk had said in early 2017 that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring cost per mile is necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel network.[195] The tunnel width is optimized for electric vehicles only, which avoids complications of exhaust venting with internal combustion engines.[196]\nBy late 2018, TBC had active construction, approved plans in place, or an operational tunnel in several areas of the United States: Baltimore,[197]\nChicago[198] and Los Angeles. TBC provided an update on the state of their technology and product line when they opened to the public their first mile-long test tunnel in Hawthorne, California, on 18 December 2018, saying it has been a proof-of-concept for the technology.[199][200]\nTBC has claimed that design is complete for their next TBM, Prufrock, and that assembly and engineering testing would begin in 2019[199]:15:18\u201315:45 but there have been no announcements of such testing beginning by the end of 2019.\nAs merchandising, the company sold 20,000 \"flamethrowers\" in 2018 [201][202], inspired by the movie Spaceballs.[203]\nAfter a string of negative press targeting Tesla caused Musk to become frustrated,[204] specifically articles published by Reveal News criticizing Tesla for its factory safety procedures,[205] Musk announced on Twitter that he is planning on creating a website where users could rate the truthfulness of specific articles in addition to the credibility of journalists and publications.[206] He suggested calling it \"Pravda\" after a Soviet Union-era Communist Party newspaper of the same name.\nThis caused backlash from many journalists, claiming that a platform where any user could freely vote on an article's or a journalist's credibility could be prone to abuse.[207][208]\nAfter realizing the site \"pravda.com\" is used by the Ukrainian Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda, Musk bought the site pravduh.com on May 25, 2018.[209]\nIn July 2018, Musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers during the Tham Luang cave rescue by arranging for his employees to build a small rescue pod.\nMusk, responding to requests for help from Twitter users,[210] contacted the Thai government.[211] He then arranged for engineers from two of his companies to design a child-sized submarine to help the rescue effort and documented the process via Twitter.[212][213] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, also urged Musk to continue construction of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[214] Engineers at Musk's companies SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine out of a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube[215] in 8 hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[216]\nNamed \"Wild Boar\" after the children's soccer team,[217] its design, based on dive team feedback, was a five-foot (1.5\u00a0m)-long, twelve-inch (300\u00a0mm)-inch wide sealed tube weighing about 90 pounds (41\u00a0kg) propelled manually by divers in the front and back with segmented compartments to place diver weights to adjust buoyancy[216][218], intended to solve the problem of safely transporting the children who might have had difficulty learning the scuba skills required to exit the cave on their own without panicking. In case the mini-submarine could not fit through the cave system, Elon Musk also requested Wing Inflatables, a California-based inflatable boat manufacturer, to build inflatable escape pods. The pods were designed, fabricated, and tested in one day before being flown to Thailand.[219][220]\nBy this time, eight of the twelve children had already been rescued (using full face masks and oxygen under anesthesia[221][222][223]) and Thai authorities decided not to use the submarine.[224][225][226]\nElon Musk was later awarded a Member of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn by the King of Thailand in March 2019 for his and his team's contributions to the rescue mission.[227][228]\nThe supervisor of the rescue operation Narongsak Osatanakorn stated that the submarine was \"technologically sophisticated, [but] it doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave\".[229][230] Vernon Unsworth, a recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the past six years and who had played a key advisory role in the rescue, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\"[231][232][233] and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as \"pedo guy\", causing backlash against Musk.[234][235] He subsequently deleted the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device, \"Stay tuned jackass.\"[235] On 16 July, Unsworth stated that he was considering legal action in relation to Musk's comments.[236][237]\nTwo days later, Musk issued an apology for his remarks.[238][239][240][241]\nOn 28 August 2018, in response to criticism from a writer on Twitter, Musk tweeted \"You don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me?\"[242] The following day, a letter from L.\u00a0Lin Wood, the rescuer's attorney, dated 6 August, emerged, showing that he had been making preparations for a libel lawsuit.[243][244]\nAt some point, a self-proclaimed private investigator emailed Musk with an offer to \"dig deep\" into Unsworth's past, which Musk accepted in August 2018;[245] the investigator was later revealed to be a convicted felon with multiple counts of fraud.[246] On 30 August, using details produced during the alleged investigation,[247][248] Musk sent a BuzzFeed News reporter who had written about the controversy an email prefaced \"off the record\". It claimed that Unsworth is a \"single white guy from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years ... until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time\" (later stated by Unsworth's partner to be false). On 5 September, the reporter tweeted a screenshot of the email, saying that \"Off the record is a two-party agreement,\" which he \"did not agree to\".[249]\nIn mid-September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles federal court.[250][251] In his defense, Musk has argued that in slang usage \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor.\" (The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang defines the term \"pedo\" as \"an unpleasant or unfortunate person ... adopted as an all-purpose insult....\")[252][253]\nThe defamation case began on December 4, 2019, in Los Angeles, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.[254] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the initial tweet. On December 6 the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable; Musk commented: \"My faith in humanity is restored.\"[255] Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, stated: \"The truth vindicated Musk and Unsworth. Our system of justice worked\".[256]\nMusk first mentioned Teslaquila in an April Fools tweet in 2018.[257] The proposed Tesla-branded tequila appeared to become closer to reality in October 2018 as Tesla filed an \"intent to use\" trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[258] The trademark is for distilled agave liquor. Musk reaffirmed his intention to release the product with a tweet, featuring a mockup of the bottle, on October 12.[259]\nMexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) has publicly denounced the proposed product, arguing, \"If it wants to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila producer, comply with certain standards and request authorization from Mexico's Industrial Property Institute.\"[260]\nOn March 30, 2019, Musk released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud under the name \"Emo G Records\".[261] The track was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.[262][263] On January 30, 2020, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[264] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable ... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on Soundcloud\",[265] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[264]\nPolitically, Musk has described himself as \"half Democrat, half Republican\" and \"I'm somewhere in the middle, socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"[266] In 2018, he stated that he was \"not a conservative. I'm registered independent [and] politically moderate.\"[267] Prompted by the emergence of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, Musk has voiced support for a universal basic income;[268] he additionally backs direct democracy.[269] He has described himself as a socialist, but \"not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm\" \u2013 arguing instead, \"true socialism seeks greatest good for all.\"[270] He supports targeting an inclusive tax rate of 40%, prefers consumption taxes to income taxes, and supports the estate tax, as the \"probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.\"[271]\nMusk has described the United States as \"[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth,\" describing it as \"the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been.\" Musk believes democracy would not exist any longer if not for the United States, saying that it prevented this disappearance on three occasions through its participation in World War I, World War II and the Cold War. Musk also stated that he thinks \"it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the United States has done.\"[272]\nBefore the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Musk criticized candidate Trump by saying: \"I feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\"[273] Following Donald Trump's inauguration, Musk expressed approval of Trump's choice of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising President Trump. Regarding his cooperation with Trump, Musk has subsequently commented: \"The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better.\"[274] He subsequently resigned from both in June 2017, in protest at Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, stating: \"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world\".[275][276]\nIn August 2019, Musk came out on Twitter in support of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, whose platform revolves around the ongoing problem of job displacement through technological automation and artificial intelligence. Musk said in a tweet that universal basic income, which Yang supports, is \"obviously needed.\"[277]\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Musk stated he was a \"significant (though not top-tier) donor to Democrats,\" but that he also gives heavily to Republicans. Musk further stated that political contributions are a requirement in order to have a voice in the United States government.[278][279]\nA 2012 report from the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending, found that since 2002, SpaceX had spent more US$4\u00a0million on lobbying the United States Congress and more than US$800,000 in political contributions to Democrats and Republicans. The same report said that \"SpaceX's campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated,\" and that \"unlike most tech-startups, SpaceX has maintained a significant lobbying presence in Washington almost since day\u00a01.\" and that \"Musk himself has donated roughly US$725,000 to various campaigns since 2002. In 2004, he contributed US$2,000 to President George W. Bush's reelection campaign, maxing out (over US$100,000)[280] to Barack Obama's reelection campaign and donated US$5,000 to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who represents Florida, a state critical to the space industry. (...) All told, Musk and SpaceX gave out roughly US$250,000 in the 2012 election cycle.\"[278][281] Additionally, SpaceX hired former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to represent the company, via the Washington-based lobbying group Patton Boggs LLP. Alongside Patton Boggs LLP, SpaceX uses several other outside lobbying firms, who work with SpaceX's own lobbyists.[282]\nMusk had been a supporter of the U.S. political action committee (PAC) FWD.us, which was started by fellow high-profile entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform. However, in May 2013, Musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the PAC was running that supported causes like the Keystone Pipeline. Musk and other members, including David O. Sacks, pulled out, criticizing the strategy as \"cynical.\"[283] Musk further stated, \"We shouldn't give in to the politics. If we give in to that, we'll get the political system we deserve.\"[284]\nIn December 2013, Sean Becker of the media/political website Mic called Musk a \"complete hypocrite,\" stating that \"[for] the 2014 election cycle, Musk has contributed to the Longhorn PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2013 both of which have funded the campaigns of anti-science, anti-environment candidates such as Rep. Michelle Bachman (R-Minn.).\"[284] Musk has directly contributed to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change.[281]\nMusk has stated that he does not believe the U.S. government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage poor behavior. Musk says that the free market would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.[285]\nMusk's statements have been widely criticized, with Stanford University Professor Fred Turner noting that \"if you're an entrepreneur like Elon Musk, you will take the money where you can get it, but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that it's entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change, not the state. It is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received. And this goes on all the time in Silicon Valley.\"[286] Author Michael Shellenberger argued that \"in the case of Musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness. And I think there is a business reason for it. They are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent.\" Shellenberger continues, \"we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble.\" While journalist and author Jim Motavalli, who interviewed Musk for High Voltage, his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that \"Elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money \u2013 I do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them.\"[287]\nIn 2015, Musk's statements were subject to further scrutiny when an LA Times article claimed that SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated US$4.9\u00a0billion in government subsidies over twenty years. One example given is New York state, which is spending $750\u00a0million to build a solar panel factory in Buffalo which will be leased to SolarCity for $1 a year. The deal also includes no property taxes for a decade, an estimated $260\u00a0million valuation. Musk employs a former U.S. State Department official as the chief negotiator for Tesla.[288]\nWhen asked whether he believed \"there was some kind of destiny involved\" in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than \"just physics\", Musk responded:\nWell, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably not because then you have to say: \"Where does the master intelligence come from?\" So it sort of begs the question. So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know it's complex phenomenon from simple elements.[289]Musk has stated that he does not pray, or worship any being, although he asked \"any entities that [were] listening\" to \"bless [the] launch\" before an important Falcon 1 launch. When asked whether he thought science and religion could co-exist, Musk replied \"Probably not.\"[290]\nAlthough Musk believes there could be simple life on other planets, he is unsure whether other intelligent life is likely.[290] Musk later said that he \"hope[s] that there is other intelligent life in the known universe\", and stated that it is \"probably more likely than not, but that's a complete guess.\"[291]\nMusk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the Fermi paradox:\nThe absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation ... Like when you're playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars in the background, but you can't ever get there. If it's not a simulation, then maybe we're in a lab and there's some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop, out of curiosity, like mould in a Petri dish ... If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilizations, and I mean strange in a bad way. ... And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilizations.[292]Musk has frequently spoken about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, calling it \"the most serious threat to the survival of the human race\". During a 2014 interview at the MIT AeroAstro Centennial Symposium, Musk described AI as humanity's largest existential threat, further stating, \"I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish.\" Musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as \"summoning the demon\".[293][294]\nDespite this, Musk invested in DeepMind, an AI firm, and Vicarious, a company working to improve machine intelligence.[295] In January 2015, he donated $10\u00a0million to the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies.[296] He was previously the co-chairman of OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.[297]\nMusk has said that his investments are \"not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return... I like to just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence. I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there. There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator. There are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.\"[295]\nIn June 2016, Musk was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation, to which he answered:\nThe strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation I think is the following: 40 years ago we had Pong \u2013 two rectangles and a dot. That's where we were. Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year. And soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable.[298]Musk's warnings about artificial intelligence have brought him some controversy. He and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg have clashed, with the latter calling his warnings \"pretty irresponsible\".[299] Musk responded to Zuckerberg's censure by saying that he had discussed AI with Zuckerberg and found him to have only a limited understanding of the subject. In 2014, Slate's Adam Elkus argued that current AIs were as intelligent as a toddler, and only in certain fields, going on to say that Musk's \"summoning the demon\" analogy may be harmful because it could result in significant cuts to AI research budgets.[300]\nThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington D.C. think-tank, awarded its Annual Luddite Award to \"alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse\"; its president, Robert D. Atkinson, complained that Musk and others say AI is the largest existential threat to humanity. Atkinson stated \"That's not a very winning message if you want to get AI funding out of Congress to the National Science Foundation.\"[301][302][303] Nature sharply disagreed with the ITIF in an April 2016 editorial, siding instead with Musk, and concluding: \"It is crucial that progress in technology is matched by solid, well-funded research to anticipate the scenarios it could bring about ... If that is a Luddite perspective, then so be it.\"[304] In a 2015 Washington Post editorial, researcher Murray Shanahan stated that human-level AI is unlikely to arrive in the near future, but that nevertheless \"the time to start thinking through the consequences is now.\"[305]\nAt a Tesla event on the sidelines of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems in December 2017, Musk stated that:\nI think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where [sic] you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end? And it doesn't go all the time. ... It's a pain in the ass. That's why everyone doesn't like it. And there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great. And so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.[306]Afterwards, he dismissed an audience member's response that public transportation functioned effectively in Japan.[307][308]\nHis comment sparked widespread criticism from both the public and transit experts. Urban planning expert Brent Toderian started the hashtag #GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit which was widely adopted by Twitter users in order to dispel Musk's notion that everybody hated public transport.[307][309][310] Yonah Freemark, an urbanist and journalist specializing in planning and transportation, summarized Musk's views on public transport as \"It's terrible. You might be killed. Japanese trains are awful. Individualized transport for everyone! Congestion? Induced demand? Climate change impacts? Unwalkable streets? Who cares!\"[306]\nJarrett Walker, a known public transport expert and consultant from Portland, said that \"Musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford\", referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferences\u00a0of a minority yields\u00a0an outcome that usually does not work for the majority.[311][312][313] Musk responded with \"You're an idiot\", later saying \"Sorry ... Meant to say 'sanctimonious idiot'.\"[314][315][316] The exchange received a significant amount of media attention and prompted Nobel laureate Paul Krugman to comment on the controversy, saying that \"You're an idiot\" is \"Elon Musk's idea of a cogent argument\".[311][317]\nMusk is chairman of the Musk Foundation, which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well as other goals.[318] In 2010, the Musk Foundation collaborated with SolarCity to donate a 25 kW solar power system to the South Bay Community Alliance's hurricane response center in Coden, Alabama.[319] In July 2011, the Musk Foundation donated US$250,000 towards a solar power project in S\u014dma, Japan, a city that had been recently devastated by a tsunami.[320]\nIn July 2014, Musk was asked by cartoonist Matthew Inman and William Terbo, the grandnephew of Nikola Tesla, to donate US$8\u00a0million toward the construction of the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.[321] Ultimately, Musk agreed to donate US$1\u00a0million toward the project and additionally pledged to build a Tesla Supercharger in the museum car park.[322]\nMusk donated US$10\u00a0million to the Future of Life Institute in January 2015, to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity.[323][296][324]\nAs of 2015[update], Musk is a trustee of the X Prize Foundation[325] and a signatory of The Giving Pledge.[326]\nIn October 2018, in an effort to help solve the Flint water crisis, Musk and the Musk Foundation donated over $480,000 to install new water fountains with filtration systems for access to clean water at all Flint, Michigan schools.[327] As of 2019, approximately 30,000 children in all 12 area schools have safe drinking water freely available from the water filtration systems.[328]\nMusk has also been a top donor for the ACLU.[329]\nIn October 2019, Musk donated US$1\u00a0million to '#TeamTrees' tree planting initiative led by the YouTube community[note 1] and in collaboration with Arbor Day Foundation.[330][331][332]\nTosca Musk, Elon's sister, is a filmmaker. She is the founder of Musk Entertainment and has produced various movies.[333]\nMusk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while both were students at Ontario's Queen's University. They married in 2000 and separated in 2008.[334] Their first son, Nevada Alexander Musk, died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.[335] They later had five sons through in vitro fertilization[336] \u2013 twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006. They share custody of all five sons.[337]\nIn 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley, and in 2010, the couple married. In January 2012, Musk announced that he had ended his four-year relationship with Riley,[27][338] tweeting to Riley, \"It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy one day.\"[339] In July 2013, Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, Musk filed for a second divorce from Riley; however, the action was withdrawn.[340] The media announced in March 2016 that divorce proceedings were again under way, this time with Riley filing for divorce from Musk.[341][342] The divorce was finalized in late 2016.[343]\nMusk began dating American actress Amber Heard in 2016 but the two split up after one year due to their conflicting schedules.[344][345]\nOn May 7, 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they had begun dating.[346][347][348] On January 8, 2020, Grimes announced she was pregnant. The baby's father is assumed to be Musk, although this was not announced.[349][350]\nOn 6 September 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. Within five days, the appearance had accrued 10 million YouTube views.[351] One of the highest profile and controversial aspects of the program was Musk's sampling a single puff from a cigar consisting, Rogan claimed, of tobacco laced with cannabis. To Rogan's inquiry on how often he smoked cannabis, Musk replied: \"Almost never. I know a lot of people like weed and that's fine, but I don't find that is very good for productivity... not for me.\" The Washington Post observed, \"In the media's hands, it became a story about Musk's growing instability\u00a0...\"[352] Tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the departure of Tesla's Vice President of Worldwide Finance earlier that day.[353] Fortune wondered if the cannabis use could have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States Air Force, though a USAF spokesperson told The Verge that there was no investigation being carried out and that the Air Force is still processing the situation.[354][355]\nIn an interview on 60 Minutes, Musk said of the cannabis-smoking incident: \"I do not smoke pot.

The successful first landing of a SpaceX Falcon\u00a09 first stage on a drone ship is shown being covered by CNN. This is followed by a scene of Musk alone in his office with the notebook that young Sheldon mailed NASA in 1989 containing calculations detailing how this feat could be accomplished.[384]\nMusk was featured in the 2015 environmental documentary Racing Extinction, in which a custom Tesla Model S was designed to help project images of critically endangered species onto public buildings, including the Empire State Building and the Vatican.[385]\nMusk appeared in several episodes of South Park including the episode \"Members Only\", November 2016, which was voiced by himself.\nIn 2016, Musk appeared as himself in the romantic comedy film Why Him? where he was briefly met by one of the main characters, Ned Flemming played by Bryan Cranston, in a bar at a party.[386] In December 2016, Robby in New Girl refers to saving a life, and when asked who, responds \"Do you know who Elon Musk is?\".[387] Also in 2016, Musk was referenced by Dr. Martin Stein on The CW time-travel TV show DC's Legends of Tomorrow.

                "text": "no title\n\nWarren Edward Buffett (/\u02c8b\u028cf\u026at/; born August 30, 1930)[2] is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist, who is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is considered one of the most successful investors in the world[3][4] and has a net worth of US$88.9\u00a0billion as of December 2019, making him the fourth-wealthiest person in the world.[5] Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring and graduating from the University of Nebraska at the age of 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing that was pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm called Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. In 1978, Charlie Munger joined Buffett and became vice chairman of the company.[6][7] Buffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970.[8] He has been referred to as the \"Oracle\" or \"Sage\" of Omaha by global media outlets.[9][10] He is noted for his adherence to value investing and for his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.[11] Research published at the University of Oxford characterizes Buffett's investment methodology as falling within \"founder centrism\" \u2013 defined by a deference to managers with a founder's mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation. Essentially, Buffett's concentrated investments shelter managers from the short-term pressures of the market.[12] Buffett is a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent[13] of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He founded The Giving Pledge in 2009 with Bill Gates, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.[14] He endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election[15] and will judge current U.S. President Donald Trump by his results on national safety, economic growth and economic participation when deciding if he will vote for him in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[16][17] Buffett was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, the second of three children and the only son of Leila (n\u00e9e Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett.[18] Buffett began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: \"likes math; a future stockbroker.\"[19] After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business, but was overruled by his father.[20][21] Buffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at the age of seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000.[22] Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola bottles, and weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.[23] In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. The business was sold later in the year for $1,200 to a war veteran.[24] Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated to schoolboy days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional stock brokerage near his father's own brokerage office. On a trip to New York City at age ten, he made a point to visit the New York Stock Exchange. At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself, and three for his philanthropic sister Doris Buffett.[25][26][27] At the age of 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly delivering Washington Post newspapers. In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer. He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings. By the time he finished college, Buffett had accumulated $9,800 in savings (about $105,000 today).[24][28] In 1947, Buffett entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He would have preferred to focus on his business ventures, but his father pressured him to enroll.[24] Warren studied there for two years and joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.[29] He then transferred to the University of Nebraska where at 19, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. After being rejected by Harvard Business School, Buffett enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He earned a Master of Science in Economics from Columbia in 1951. After graduating, Buffett attended the New York Institute of Finance.[30] The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety. That's what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years from now they will still be the cornerstones of investing.[31][32][33] Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk & Co. as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at Buffett Partnership, Ltd. as a general partner; and from 1970 as Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. In April 1952, Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of GEICO insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's Vice President, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence,[34] and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an \"extraordinary man\" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street but both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.[35] Buffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a Dale Carnegie public speaking course.[36] Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an \"Investment Principles\" night class at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair Texaco gas station as a side investment but it was unsuccessful.[37] In 1952,[38] Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The next year they had their first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $114,000 today).[28] There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $1.64\u00a0million today)[28] and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd. In 1957, Buffett operated three partnerships. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha, where he still lives, for $31,500.[39][40] In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, Peter Andrew, was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner Charlie Munger. By 1960, Buffett operated seven partnerships. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own. In 1961, Buffett revealed that 35% of the partnership's assets were invested in the Sanborn Map Company. He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at \"minus $20.\" Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor, obtaining a seat for himself on the Board of Directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares. To avoid a proxy fight, the Board offered to repurchase shares at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in.[41][42] Buffett had obtained a 50% return on investment in just two years.[43] In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway. He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton, the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade.[44] He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold. Buffett wrote in his letter: \"...\u00a0unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL.\"[citation needed] In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business\u00a0\u2014 Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents.[45] In 1969, following his most successful year, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners. Among the assets paid out were shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. He lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income. In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the Washington Post Company. Buffett became close friends with Katharine Graham, who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper, and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of Wesco Financial, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the Buffalo Evening News for $32.5\u00a0million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the Buffalo Courier-Express. Both papers lost money, until the Courier-Express folded in 1982. In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. Capital Cities announced a $3.5\u00a0billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985 surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.[46] The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some stations due to U.S. Federal Communications Commission ownership rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same markets.[47] In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving John Gutfreund (former CEO of Salomon Brothers) surfaced. A rogue trader, Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.[48] Buffett became Chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed.[49] In 1988, Buffett began buying The Coca-Cola Company stock, eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02\u00a0billion.[50] It would turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments, and one which it still holds.[51] Buffett became a billionaire when Berkshire Hathaway began selling class A shares on May 29, 1990, with the market closing at $7,175 a share.[52] In 1998 he acquired General Re (Gen Re) as a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties\u2014according to the Rational Walk investment website, \"underwriting standards proved to be inadequate,\" while a \"problematic derivatives book\" was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss.[53] Gen Re later provided reinsurance after Buffett became involved with Maurice R. Greenberg at AIG in 2002.[54] During a 2005 investigation of an accounting fraud case involving AIG, Gen Re executives became implicated. On March 15, 2005, the AIG board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as Chairman and CEO after New York state regulators claimed that AIG had engaged in questionable transactions and improper accounting.[55] On February 9, 2006, AIG agreed to pay a $1.6\u00a0billion fine.[56] In 2010, the U.S. government agreed to a $92\u00a0million settlement with Gen Re, allowing the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary to avoid prosecution in the AIG case. Gen Re also made a commitment to implement \"corporate governance concessions,\" which required Berkshire Hathaway's Chief Financial Officer to attend General Re's audit committee meetings and mandated the appointment of an independent director.[53] In 2002, Buffett entered in $11\u00a0billion worth of forward contracts to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2\u00a0billion. In 2006, Buffett announced in June that he gradually would give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006\u2014the largest contribution would go to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.[57] In 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business.[58] Buffett had previously selected Lou Simpson, who runs investments at GEICO, to fill the role, but Simpson is only six years younger than Buffett.[citation needed] Buffett ran into criticism during the subprime crisis of 2007\u20132008, part of the recession that started in 2007, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals.[59] \"Buy American. I am.\" he wrote for an opinion piece published in the New York Times in 2008.[60] Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 \"poetic justice\".[61] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway suffered a 77% drop in earnings during Q3 2008 and several of his later deals suffered large mark-to-market losses.[62] Berkshire Hathaway acquired 10% perpetual preferred stock of Goldman Sachs.[63] Some of Buffett's put options (European exercise at expiry only) that he wrote (sold) were running at around $6.73\u00a0billion mark-to-market losses as of late 2008.[64] The scale of the potential loss prompted the SEC to demand that Berkshire produce, \"a more robust disclosure\" of factors used to value the contracts.[64] Buffett also helped Dow Chemical pay for its $18.8\u00a0billion takeover of Rohm & Haas. He thus became the single largest shareholder in the enlarged group with his Berkshire Hathaway, which provided $3\u00a0billion, underlining his instrumental role during the crisis in debt and equity markets.[65] In 2008, Buffett became the richest person in the world, with a total net worth estimated at $62\u00a0billion[66] by Forbes and at $58\u00a0billion[67] by Yahoo, overtaking Bill Gates, who had been number one on the Forbes list for 13 consecutive years.[68] In 2009, Gates regained the top position on the Forbes list, with Buffett shifted to second place. Both of the men's values dropped, to $40\u00a0billion and $37\u00a0billion respectively\u2014according to Forbes, Buffett lost $25\u00a0billion over a 12-month period during 2008/2009.[69] In October 2008, the media reported that Buffett had agreed to buy General Electric (GE) preferred stock.[70] The operation included special incentives: He received an option to buy three\u00a0billion shares of GE stock, at $22.25, over the five years following the agreement, and Buffett also received a 10% dividend (callable within three years). In February 2009, Buffett sold some Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson shares from his personal portfolio.[71] In addition to suggestions of mistiming, the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company, which in 1998 peaked at $86, raised questions. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company's 2004 annual report: That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.[72]In March 2009, Buffett said in a cable television interview that the economy had \"fallen off a cliff ... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven't seen\". Additionally, Buffett feared that inflation levels that occurred in the 1970s\u2014which led to years of painful stagflation\u2014might re-emerge.[73][74] On August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway's shares hit $200,000 a share for the first time, capitalizing the company at $328\u00a0billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth $64.2\u00a0billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 for failing to report December 9, 2013, purchase of shares in USG Corporation as required.[75] In 2009, Buffett invested $2.6\u00a0billion as a part of Swiss Re's campaign to raise equity capital.[76][77] Berkshire Hathaway already owned a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%.[78] Also in 2009, Buffett acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. for $34\u00a0billion in cash and stock. Alice Schroeder, author of Snowball, said that a key reason for the purchase was to diversify Berkshire Hathaway from the financial industry.[79] Measured by market capitalization in the Financial Times Global 500, Berkshire Hathaway was the eighteenth largest corporation in the world as of June 2009.[80] In 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips, saying to his Berkshire investors, I bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40\u2013$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.[81]The merger with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) closed upon BNSF shareholder approval during Q1 of 2010. This deal was valued at approximately $44\u00a0billion (with $10 billion of outstanding BNSF debt) and represented an increase of the previously existing stake of 22%.[82][83] In June 2010, Buffett defended the credit-rating agencies for their role in the US financial crisis, claiming: Very, very few people could appreciate the bubble. That's the nature of bubbles \u2013 they're mass delusions.[84]On March 18, 2011, Goldman Sachs was given Federal Reserve approval to buy back Berkshire's preferred stock in Goldman. Buffett had been reluctant to give up the stock, which averaged $1.4\u00a0million in dividends per day,[85][86] saying: I'm going to be the Osama bin Laden of capitalism. I'm on my way to an unknown destination in Asia where I'm going to look for a cave. If the U.S. Armed forces can't find Osama bin Laden in 10 years, let Goldman Sachs try to find me.[87]In November 2011, it was announced that over the course of the previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64\u00a0million shares of International Business Machine Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11\u00a0billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent\u2014the largest stake in IBM alongside that of State Street Global Advisors. Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, \"I don't know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM.\"[88] In May 2012, Buffett's acquisition of Media General, consisting of 63 newspapers in the south-eastern U.S., was announced.[89] The company was the second news print purchase made by Buffett in one year.[90] Interim publisher James W. Hopson announced on July 18, 2013 that the Press of Atlantic City would be sold to Buffett's BH Media Group by ABARTA, a private holding company based in Pittsburgh, U.S. At the Berkshire shareholders meeting in May 2013, Buffett explained that he did not expect to \"move the needle\" at Berkshire with newspaper acquisitions, but he anticipates an annual return of 10 percent. The Press of Atlantic City became Berkshire's 30th daily newspaper, following other purchases such as Virginia, U.S.' Roanoke Times and The Tulsa World in Oklahoma, U.S.[91] During a presentation to Georgetown University students in Washington, D.C. in late September 2013, Buffett compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund and stated that the bank is generating \"$80\u00a0billion or $90\u00a0billion a year probably\" in revenue for the U.S. government. Buffett also advocated further on the issue of wealth equality in society: We have learned to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven't learned as well how to have everybody share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as ours is to figure out how nobody gets left too far behind.[92]After the difficulties of the economic crisis, Buffett managed to bring its company back to its pre-recession standards: in Q2 2014, Berkshire Hathaway made $6.4\u00a0billion in net profit, the most it had ever made in a three-month period.[93] Warren Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators[94] as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:[95] The arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5 percent inflation. In his article, \"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\", Buffett rebutted the academic efficient-market hypothesis, that beating the S&P 500 was \"pure chance\", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named Walter J. Schloss, Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson (Tweedy, Browne LLC), William J. Ruane (Sequoia Fund), Charlie Munger (Buffett's partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments).[96] In his November 1999 Fortune article, he warned of investors' unrealistic expectations:[97] Let me summarize what I've been saying about the stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything like\u2014anything like\u2014they've performed in the past 17. If I had to pick the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined, that investors in aggregate\u2014repeat, aggregate\u2014would earn in a world of constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful frictional costs, it would be 6%! Buffett has been a supporter of index funds for people who are either not interested in managing their own money or don't have the time. Buffett is skeptical that active management can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that \"when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.\"[98] In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S&P 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees. By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that made the bet against Buffett.[98] In 1949, Buffett was infatuated with a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele. In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the diminutive instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt was unsuccessful, his music interest was a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson's life and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stock holder meetings and other opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity.[99] Buffett married Susan Buffett (n\u00e9e Thompson) in 1952. They had three children, Susie, Howard and Peter. The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained married until Susan Buffett's death in July 2004. Their daughter, Susie, lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc., and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett Foundation.[100] In 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old\u2014she had lived with him since his wife's departure to San Francisco in 1977.[101][102] Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left Omaha to pursue her singing career. All three were close and Christmas cards to friends were signed \"Warren, Susie and Astrid\".[103] Susan briefly discussed this relationship in an interview on the Charlie Rose Show shortly before her death, in a rare glimpse into Buffett's personal life.[104] Buffett disowned his son Peter's adopted daughter, Nicole, in 2006 after she participated in the Jamie Johnson documentary The One Percent about the growing economic inequality between the wealthy and the average citizen in the United States. Although his first wife referred to Nicole as one of her \"adored grandchildren\",[105] Buffett wrote her a letter stating, \"I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a grandchild, nor have the rest of my family adopted you as a niece or a cousin.\"[106][107][108] His 2006 annual salary was about $100,000, which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in comparable companies.[109] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000.[110] He continued to live in the same house in the central Dundee neighborhood of Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500, a fraction of today's value. He also owns a $4\u00a0million house in Laguna Beach, California.[111] In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7\u00a0million of Berkshire's funds on a private jet, Buffett named it \"The Indefensible\". This act was a break from his past condemnation of extravagant purchases by other CEOs and his history of using more public transportation.[112] \u2014Buffett on bridge[113] Buffett is an avid bridge player, which he plays with fellow fan Gates[114]\u2014he allegedly spends 12 hours a week playing the game.[115] In 2006, he sponsored a bridge match for the Buffett Cup. Modeled on the Ryder Cup in golf\u2014held immediately before it in the same city\u2014the teams are chosen by invitation, with a female team and five male teams provided by each country.[116] He is a dedicated, lifelong follower of Nebraska football, and attends as many games as his schedule permits. He supported the hire of Bo Pelini, following the 2007 season, stating, \"It was getting kind of desperate around here\".[117] He watched the 2009 game against Oklahoma from the Nebraska sideline, after being named an honorary assistant coach.[118] Buffett worked with Christopher Webber on an animated series called \"Secret Millionaires Club\" with chief Andy Heyward of DiC Entertainment. The series features Buffett and Munger, and teaches children healthy financial habits.[119][120] Buffett was raised as a Presbyterian, but has since described himself as agnostic.[121] In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett did not carry a mobile phone, did not have a computer at his desk, and drove his own automobile,[122] a Cadillac DTS.[123] In contrast to that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, he stated he uses Google as his preferred search engine.[124] In 2013 he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire life.[125] Buffett reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the Omaha World Herald, which his company acquired in 2011. Buffett's speeches are known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett presides over Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in the Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska, an event drawing over 20,000 visitors from both the United States and abroad, giving it the nickname \"Woodstock of Capitalism\". Berkshire's annual reports and letters to shareholders, prepared by Buffett, frequently receive coverage by the financial media. Buffett's writings are known for containing quotations from sources as varied as the Bible and Mae West,[126] as well as advice in a folksy, Midwestern style and numerous jokes. In April 2017, Buffett (an avid Coca-Cola drinker and investor in the company) agreed to have his likeness placed on Cherry Coke products in China. Buffett was not compensated for this advertisement.[127][128] On April 11, 2012, Buffett was diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer during a routine test.[129] He announced he would begin two months of daily radiation treatment from mid-July. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said he felt \"great - as if I were in my normal excellent health - and my energy level is 100 percent.\" On September 15, 2012, Buffett announced that he had completed the full 44-day radiation treatment cycle, saying \"it's a great day for me\" and \"I am so glad to say that's over.\"[130] In 2008, Buffett was ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of approximately $62 billion.[131] In 2009, after donating billions of dollars to charity, he was ranked as the second richest man in the United States with a net worth of $37\u00a0billion[132][133] with only Bill Gates ranked higher than Buffett. His net worth had risen to $58.5\u00a0billion as of September 2013.[134] In 1999, Buffett was named the top money manager of the Twentieth Century in a survey by the Carson Group, ahead of Peter Lynch and John Templeton.[135] In 2007, he was listed among Time's 100 Most Influential People in the world.[136] In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[137] Buffett, along with Bill Gates, was named the most influential global thinker in Foreign Policy's 2010 report.[138] Buffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents.[139] His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. He once commented, \"I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing\".[140] Buffett had long stated his intention to give away his fortune to charity, and in June 2006, he announced a new plan to give 83% of it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[141] He pledged about the equivalent of 10\u00a0million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (worth approximately $30.7\u00a0billion as of June 23, 2006),[142] making it the largest charitable donation in history, and Buffett one of the leaders of philanthrocapitalism.[143] The foundation will receive 5% of the total each July, beginning in 2006. (The pledge is conditional upon the foundation's giving away each year, beginning in 2009, an amount that is at least equal to the value of the entire previous year's gift from Buffett, in addition to 5% of the foundation's net assets.) Buffett joined the Gates Foundation's board, but did not plan to be actively involved in the foundation's investments.[144][145] This represented a significant shift from Buffett's previous statements, to the effect that most of his fortune would pass to his Buffett Foundation.[146] The bulk of the estate of his wife, valued at $2.6\u00a0billion, went there when she died in 2004.[147] He also pledged $50\u00a0million to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in Washington, where he began serving as an adviser in 2002.[148] In 2006, he auctioned his 2001 Lincoln Town Car[149] on eBay to raise money for Girls, Inc.[150] In 2007, he auctioned a luncheon with himself that raised a final bid of $650,100 for the Glide Foundation.[151] Later auctions raised $2.1\u00a0million[152][153] $1.7\u00a0million[154] and $3.5\u00a0million. The winners traditionally dine with Buffett at New York's Smith and Wollensky steak house. The restaurant donates at least $10,000 to Glide each year to host the meal.[155] In 2009, Ralph Nader wrote the book \"Only the Super Rich Can Save Us,\" a novel about \"a movement of billionaires led by Warren Buffett and featuring, among others, Ted Turner, George Soros and Barry Diller, who use their fortunes to clean up America.\".[156] On C-SPAN BookTV, Nader said Buffett invited him to breakfast after the book came out and was \"quite intrigued by the book.\" He also told Nader of his plan to get \"billionaires all over the world to donate 50% of their estate to charity or good works.\" [157] On December 9, 2010, Buffett, Bill Gates, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a promise they called the \"Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge\", in which they promise to donate to charity at least half of their wealth, and invite other wealthy people to follow suit.[14][158] In 2018, after making almost $3.4\u00a0billion donations,[159] Buffet was ranked 3rd in the Forbes' List of Billionaire 2018.[160] Warren Buffett continues to help fund and support his family's individual foundations which include Susan Buffett's Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, Susan Alice Buffett's Sherwood Foundation, Howard Graham Buffett's Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and Peter Buffett's NoVo Foundation.[161][162] Warren Buffett is also supportive of his sister Doris Buffett's Letters Foundation and Learning By Giving Foundation.[163][164] In addition to political contributions over the years, Buffett endorsed and made campaign contributions to Barack Obama's presidential campaign. On July 2, 2008, Buffett attended a $28,500 per plate fundraiser for Obama's campaign in Chicago.[165] Buffett intimated that John McCain's views on social justice were so far from his own that McCain would need a \"lobotomy\" for Buffett to change his endorsement.[166] During the second 2008 U.S. presidential debate, McCain and Obama, after being asked first by presidential debate mediator Tom Brokaw, both mentioned Buffett as a possible future Secretary of the Treasury.[167] Later, in the third and final presidential debate, Obama mentioned Buffett as a potential economic advisor.[168] Buffett was also finance advisor to California Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger during his 2003 election campaign.[169] On December 16, 2015, Buffett endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president.[15] On August 1, 2016, Buffett challenged Donald Trump to release his tax returns.[170][171] On October 10, 2016, after another reference to him in the 2nd 2016 presidential debate, Buffett released his own tax return.[172][173] He said he had paid $1.85\u00a0million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6\u00a0million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8\u00a0billion worth of donations last year.[173] Buffett said, \"I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump -- at least he would have no legal problem.\" This was a response to Trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit.[173] Buffett described the health care reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage.[174] Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs.[174] Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP.[175] (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.)[176] Buffett said \"If you want the very best, I mean if you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best\", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).[177] Buffett faults the incentives in the United States medical industry, that payers reimburse doctors for procedures (fee-for-service) leading to unnecessary care (overutilization), instead of paying for results.[178] He cited Atul Gawande's 2009 article in the New Yorker[179] as a useful consideration of US health care, with its documentation of unwarranted variation in Medicare expenditures between McAllen, Texas and El Paso, Texas.[178] Buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry, saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income.[180] Buffett stated that he only paid 19% of his income for 2006 ($48.1\u00a0million) in total federal taxes (due to their source as dividends and capital gains), while his employees paid 33% of theirs, despite making much less money.[181] \"How can this be fair?\" Buffett asked, regarding how little he pays in taxes compared to his employees. \"How can this be right?\" He also added, \"There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.\"[182][183] After Donald Trump accused him of taking \"massive deductions,\" Buffett countered, \"I have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward.\"[184] Buffett favors the inheritance tax, saying that repealing it would be like \"choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics\".[185] In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy.[186] Some critics argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments.[187] Buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling, or legalizing casinos, calling it a tax on ignorance.[188] Buffett viewed the United States' expanding trade deficit as a trend that will devalue the US dollar and US assets. He predicted that the US dollar will lose value in the long run, as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of US assets in the hands of foreigners. In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, he predicted that in another ten years' time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11\u00a0trillion. Americans\u00a0... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an 'ownership society' will not find happiness in \u2013 and I'll use hyperbole here for emphasis\u00a0\u2013 a 'sharecropping society'.The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett has been critical of gold as an investment,his critique being based primarily on its non-productive nature. In a 1998 address at Harvard, Buffett said: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated: Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation \u2013 at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.[189]Buffett invested in PetroChina Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary[190] on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the Sudanese civil war that caused Harvard to divest. He sold this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008. In October 2008, Buffett invested $230\u00a0million for 10% of battery maker BYD Company (SEHK:\u00a01211), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer BYD Auto. In less than one year, the investment reaped over 500% return.[191] In May 2018, BYD's shares had a substantial fall with a total net investment loss of $9\u00a0billion. This was Buffett's worst investment in China.[192] During the RJR Nabisco, Inc. hostile takeover fight in 1987, Buffett was quoted as telling John Gutfreund:[193] I'll tell you why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It's addictive. And there's fantastic brand loyalty. Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s 1994 annual meeting, Buffett said investments in tobacco are:[194] fraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration. I would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses. The economy of the business may be fine, but that doesn't mean it has a bright future. In 2007, Buffett's PacifiCorp, a subsidiary of his MidAmerican Energy Company, canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah's Intermountain Power Project Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp's Integrated Resource Plan. The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups.[195] Native American tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the Klamath River. David Sokol responded on Buffett's behalf, stating that the FERC would decide the question.[196][197] In December 2011, Buffett's MidAmerican Energy Holdings agreed to buy a $2\u00a0billion solar energy project under development in California and a 49 percent stake in a $1.8\u00a0billion plant in Arizona, his first investments in solar power. He already owned wind farms.[198] He has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements. At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the Indiana House of Representatives to change the value of Pi from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat.[199] When a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don't belong in the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong?[200]In May 2012, Buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new social media companies such as Facebook and Google because it is hard to estimate future value. He also stated that initial public offering (IPO) of stock are almost always bad investments. Investors should be looking to companies that will have good value in ten years.[201] In an interview with CNBC in January 2018, Buffett said that the recent craze over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won't end well, adding that \"when it happens or how or anything else, I don't know.\" But he said he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures.[202] In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending.Aside from countless television appearances on various news programs, Buffett has appeared in numerous films and TV programs, both documentary and fiction. He has been a guest 10 times on Charlie Rose, and was the subject of the HBO documentary feature Becoming Warren Buffett (2017) and the BBC production The World's Greatest Money Maker (2009). In October 2008, USA Today reported at least 47 books were in print with Buffett's name in the title. The article quoted the CEO of Borders Books, George Jones, as saying that the only other living persons named in as many book titles were U.S. presidents, world political figures and the Dalai Lama.[203] Buffett said that his own personal favorite is a collection of his essays called The Essays of Warren Buffett,[204] which he described as \"a coherent rearrangement of ideas from my annual report letters\".[203] Books or publications by Buffett: Some best-selling, or otherwise notable, books about Buffett:",

He is considered one of the most successful investors in the world[3][4] and has a net worth of US$88.9\u00a0billion as of December 2019, making him the fourth-wealthiest person in the world.[5]\nBuffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring and graduating from the University of Nebraska at the age of 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing that was pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm called Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. In 1978, Charlie Munger joined Buffett and became vice chairman of the company.[6][7]\nBuffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970.[8] He has been referred to as the \"Oracle\" or \"Sage\" of Omaha by global media outlets.[9][10] He is noted for his adherence to value investing and for his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.[11] Research published at the University of Oxford characterizes Buffett's investment methodology as falling within \"founder centrism\" \u2013 defined by a deference to managers with a founder's mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation. Essentially, Buffett's concentrated investments shelter managers from the short-term pressures of the market.[12]\nBuffett is a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent[13] of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He founded The Giving Pledge in 2009 with Bill Gates, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.[14] He endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election[15] and will judge current U.S. President Donald Trump by his results on national safety, economic growth and economic participation when deciding if he will vote for him in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[16][17]\nBuffett was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, the second of three children and the only son of Leila (n\u00e9e Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett.[18] Buffett began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: \"likes math; a future stockbroker.\"[19] After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business, but was overruled by his father.[20][21]\nBuffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at the age of seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000.[22] Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola bottles, and weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.[23] In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. The business was sold later in the year for $1,200 to a war veteran.[24]\nBuffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated to schoolboy days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional stock brokerage near his father's own brokerage office. On a trip to New York City at age ten, he made a point to visit the New York Stock Exchange. At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself, and three for his philanthropic sister Doris Buffett.[25][26][27] At the age of 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly delivering Washington Post newspapers. In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer. He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings. By the time he finished college, Buffett had accumulated $9,800 in savings (about $105,000 today).[24][28]\nIn 1947, Buffett entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He would have preferred to focus on his business ventures, but his father pressured him to enroll.[24] Warren studied there for two years and joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.[29] He then transferred to the University of Nebraska where at 19, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. After being rejected by Harvard Business School, Buffett enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He earned a Master of Science in Economics from Columbia in 1951. After graduating, Buffett attended the New York Institute of Finance.[30]\nThe basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety. That's what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years from now they will still be the cornerstones of investing.[31][32][33]\nBuffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk &amp; Co. as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at Buffett Partnership, Ltd. as a general partner; and from 1970 as Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\nIn April 1952, Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of GEICO insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's Vice President, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence,[34] and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an \"extraordinary man\" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street but both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.[35]\nBuffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a Dale Carnegie public speaking course.[36] Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an \"Investment Principles\" night class at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair Texaco gas station as a side investment  but it was unsuccessful.[37]\nIn 1952,[38] Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The next year they had their first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $114,000 today).[28] There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $1.64\u00a0million today)[28] and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.\nIn 1957, Buffett operated three partnerships. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha, where he still lives, for $31,500.[39][40] In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, Peter Andrew, was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner Charlie Munger. By 1960, Buffett operated seven partnerships. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own.\nIn 1961, Buffett revealed that 35% of the partnership's assets were invested in the Sanborn Map Company. He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at \"minus $20.\" Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor, obtaining a seat for himself on the Board of Directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares. To avoid a proxy fight, the Board offered to repurchase shares at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in.[41][42] Buffett had obtained a 50% return on investment in just two years.[43]\nIn 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway. He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton, the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade.[44] He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold. Buffett wrote in his letter: \"...\u00a0unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL.\"[citation needed]\nIn a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business\u00a0\u2014 Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents.[45] In 1969, following his most successful year, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners. Among the assets paid out were shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. He lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income.\nIn 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the Washington Post Company. Buffett became close friends with Katharine Graham, who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper, and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of Wesco Financial, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the Buffalo Evening News for $32.5\u00a0million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the Buffalo Courier-Express. Both papers lost money, until the Courier-Express folded in 1982.\nIn 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. Capital Cities announced a $3.5\u00a0billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985 surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.[46] The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some stations due to U.S. Federal Communications Commission ownership rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same markets.[47]\nIn 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving John Gutfreund (former CEO of Salomon Brothers) surfaced. A rogue trader, Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.[48] Buffett became Chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed.[49]\nIn 1988, Buffett began buying The Coca-Cola Company stock, eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02\u00a0billion.[50] It would turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments, and one which it still holds.[51]\nBuffett became a billionaire when Berkshire Hathaway began selling class A shares on May 29, 1990, with the market closing at $7,175 a share.[52] In 1998 he acquired General Re (Gen Re) as a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties\u2014according to the Rational Walk investment website, \"underwriting standards proved to be inadequate,\" while a \"problematic derivatives book\" was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss.[53] Gen Re later provided reinsurance after Buffett became involved with Maurice R. Greenberg at AIG in 2002.[54]\nDuring a 2005 investigation of an accounting fraud case involving AIG, Gen Re executives became implicated. On March 15, 2005, the AIG board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as Chairman and CEO after New York state regulators claimed that AIG had engaged in questionable transactions and improper accounting.[55] On February 9, 2006, AIG agreed to pay a $1.6\u00a0billion fine.[56] In 2010, the U.S. government agreed to a $92\u00a0million settlement with Gen Re, allowing the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary to avoid prosecution in the AIG case. Gen Re also made a commitment to implement \"corporate governance concessions,\" which required Berkshire Hathaway's Chief Financial Officer to attend General Re's audit committee meetings and mandated the appointment of an independent director.[53]\nIn 2002, Buffett entered in $11\u00a0billion worth of forward contracts to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2\u00a0billion. In 2006, Buffett announced in June that he gradually would give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006\u2014the largest contribution would go to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.[57]\nIn 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business.[58] Buffett had previously selected Lou Simpson, who runs investments at GEICO, to fill the role, but Simpson is only six years younger than Buffett.[citation needed]\nBuffett ran into criticism during the subprime crisis of 2007\u20132008, part of the recession that started in 2007, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals.[59] \"Buy American. I am.\" he wrote for an opinion piece published in the New York Times in 2008.[60] Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 \"poetic justice\".[61] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway suffered a 77% drop in earnings during Q3 2008 and several of his later deals suffered large mark-to-market losses.[62]\nBerkshire Hathaway acquired 10% perpetual preferred stock of Goldman Sachs.[63] Some of Buffett's put options (European exercise at expiry only) that he wrote (sold) were running at around $6.73\u00a0billion mark-to-market losses as of late 2008.[64] The scale of the potential loss prompted the SEC to demand that Berkshire produce, \"a more robust disclosure\" of factors used to value the contracts.[64] Buffett also helped Dow Chemical pay for its $18.8\u00a0billion takeover of Rohm &amp; Haas. He thus became the single largest shareholder in the enlarged group with his Berkshire Hathaway, which provided $3\u00a0billion, underlining his instrumental role during the crisis in debt and equity markets.[65]\nIn 2008, Buffett became the richest person in the world, with a total net worth estimated at $62\u00a0billion[66] by Forbes and at $58\u00a0billion[67] by Yahoo, overtaking Bill Gates, who had been number one on the Forbes list for 13 consecutive years.[68] In 2009, Gates regained the top position on the Forbes list, with Buffett shifted to second place. Both of the men's values dropped, to $40\u00a0billion and $37\u00a0billion respectively\u2014according to Forbes, Buffett lost $25\u00a0billion over a 12-month period during 2008/2009.[69]\nIn October 2008, the media reported that Buffett had agreed to buy General Electric (GE) preferred stock.[70] The operation included special incentives: He received an option to buy three\u00a0billion shares of GE stock, at $22.25, over the five years following the agreement, and Buffett also received a 10% dividend (callable within three years). In February 2009, Buffett sold some Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Johnson &amp; Johnson shares from his personal portfolio.[71]\nIn addition to suggestions of mistiming, the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company, which in 1998 peaked at $86, raised questions. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company's 2004 annual report:\nThat may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.[72]In March 2009, Buffett said in a cable television interview that the economy had \"fallen off a cliff ... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven't seen\". Additionally, Buffett feared that inflation levels that occurred in the 1970s\u2014which led to years of painful stagflation\u2014might re-emerge.[73][74]\nOn August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway's shares hit $200,000 a share for the first time, capitalizing the company at $328\u00a0billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth $64.2\u00a0billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 for failing to report December 9, 2013, purchase of shares in USG Corporation as required.[75]\nIn 2009, Buffett invested $2.6\u00a0billion as a part of Swiss Re's campaign to raise equity capital.[76][77] Berkshire Hathaway already owned a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%.[78] Also in 2009, Buffett acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. for $34\u00a0billion in cash and stock. Alice Schroeder, author of Snowball, said that a key reason for the purchase was to diversify Berkshire Hathaway from the financial industry.[79] Measured by market capitalization in the Financial Times Global 500, Berkshire Hathaway was the eighteenth largest corporation in the world as of June 2009.[80]\nIn 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips, saying to his Berkshire investors,\nI bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40\u2013$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.[81]The merger with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) closed upon BNSF shareholder approval during Q1 of 2010. This deal was valued at approximately $44\u00a0billion (with $10 billion of outstanding BNSF debt) and represented an increase of the previously existing stake of 22%.[82][83]\nIn June 2010, Buffett defended the credit-rating agencies for their role in the US financial crisis, claiming:\nVery, very few people could appreciate the bubble. That's the nature of bubbles \u2013 they're mass delusions.[84]On March 18, 2011, Goldman Sachs was given Federal Reserve approval to buy back Berkshire's preferred stock in Goldman. Buffett had been reluctant to give up the stock, which averaged $1.4\u00a0million in dividends per day,[85][86] saying:\nI'm going to be the Osama bin Laden of capitalism. I'm on my way to an unknown destination in Asia where I'm going to look for a cave. If the U.S. Armed forces can't find Osama bin Laden in 10 years, let Goldman Sachs try to find me.[87]In November 2011, it was announced that over the course of the previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64\u00a0million shares of International Business Machine Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11\u00a0billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent\u2014the largest stake in IBM alongside that of State Street Global Advisors. Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, \"I don't know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM.\"[88]\nIn May 2012, Buffett's acquisition of Media General, consisting of 63 newspapers in the south-eastern U.S., was announced.[89] The company was the second news print purchase made by Buffett in one year.[90]\nInterim publisher James W. Hopson announced on July 18, 2013 that the Press of Atlantic City would be sold to Buffett's BH Media Group by ABARTA, a private holding company based in Pittsburgh, U.S. At the Berkshire shareholders meeting in May 2013, Buffett explained that he did not expect to \"move the needle\" at Berkshire with newspaper acquisitions, but he anticipates an annual return of 10 percent. The Press of Atlantic City became Berkshire's 30th daily newspaper, following other purchases such as Virginia, U.S.' Roanoke Times and The Tulsa World in Oklahoma, U.S.[91]\nDuring a presentation to Georgetown University students in Washington, D.C. in late September 2013, Buffett compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund and stated that the bank is generating \"$80\u00a0billion or $90\u00a0billion a year probably\" in revenue for the U.S. government. Buffett also advocated further on the issue of wealth equality in society:\nWe have learned to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven't learned as well how to have everybody share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as ours is to figure out how nobody gets left too far behind.[92]After the difficulties of the economic crisis, Buffett managed to bring its company back to its pre-recession standards: in Q2 2014, Berkshire Hathaway made $6.4\u00a0billion in net profit, the most it had ever made in a three-month period.[93]\nWarren Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators[94] as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:[95]\nThe arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5 percent inflation.\nIn his article, \"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\", Buffett rebutted the academic efficient-market hypothesis, that beating the S&amp;P 500 was \"pure chance\", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named Walter J. Schloss, Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson (Tweedy, Browne LLC), William J. Ruane (Sequoia Fund), Charlie Munger (Buffett's partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments).[96] In his November 1999 Fortune article, he warned of investors' unrealistic expectations:[97]\nLet me summarize what I've been saying about the stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything like\u2014anything like\u2014they've performed in the past 17. If I had to pick the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined, that investors in aggregate\u2014repeat, aggregate\u2014would earn in a world of constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful frictional costs, it would be 6%!\nBuffett has been a supporter of index funds for people who are either not interested in managing their own money or don't have the time. Buffett is skeptical that active management can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that \"when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients.\"[98] In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S&amp;P 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees. By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that made the bet against Buffett.[98]\nIn 1949, Buffett was infatuated with a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele. In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the diminutive instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt was unsuccessful, his music interest was a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson's life and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stock holder meetings and other opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity.[99]\nBuffett married Susan Buffett (n\u00e9e Thompson) in 1952. They had three children, Susie, Howard and Peter. The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained married until Susan Buffett's death in July 2004. Their daughter, Susie, lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc., and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett Foundation.[100]\nIn 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old\u2014she had lived with him since his wife's departure to San Francisco in 1977.[101][102] Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left Omaha to pursue her singing career. All three were close and Christmas cards to friends were signed \"Warren, Susie and Astrid\".[103] Susan briefly discussed this relationship in an interview on the Charlie Rose Show shortly before her death, in a rare glimpse into Buffett's personal life.[104]\nBuffett disowned his son Peter's adopted daughter, Nicole, in 2006 after she participated in the Jamie Johnson documentary The One Percent about the growing economic inequality between the wealthy and the average citizen in the United States. Although his first wife referred to Nicole as one of her \"adored grandchildren\",[105] Buffett wrote her a letter stating, \"I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a grandchild, nor have the rest of my family adopted you as a niece or a cousin.\"[106][107][108]\nHis 2006 annual salary was about $100,000, which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in comparable companies.[109] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000.[110] He continued to live in the same house in the central Dundee neighborhood of Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500, a fraction of today's value. He also owns a $4\u00a0million house in Laguna Beach, California.[111] In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7\u00a0million of Berkshire's funds on a private jet, Buffett named it \"The Indefensible\". This act was a break from his past condemnation of extravagant purchases by other CEOs and his history of using more public transportation.[112]\n\u2014Buffett on bridge[113]\nBuffett is an avid bridge player, which he plays with fellow fan Gates[114]\u2014he allegedly spends 12 hours a week playing the game.[115] In 2006, he sponsored a bridge match for the Buffett Cup. Modeled on the Ryder Cup in golf\u2014held immediately before it in the same city\u2014the teams are chosen by invitation, with a female team and five male teams provided by each country.[116]\nHe is a dedicated, lifelong follower of Nebraska football, and attends as many games as his schedule permits. He supported the hire of Bo Pelini, following the 2007 season, stating, \"It was getting kind of desperate around here\".[117] He watched the 2009 game against Oklahoma from the Nebraska sideline, after being named an honorary assistant coach.[118]\nBuffett worked with Christopher Webber on an animated series called \"Secret Millionaires Club\" with chief Andy Heyward of DiC Entertainment. The series features Buffett and Munger, and teaches children healthy financial habits.[119][120]\nBuffett was raised as a Presbyterian, but has since described himself as agnostic.[121] In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett did not carry a mobile phone, did not have a computer at his desk, and drove his own automobile,[122] a Cadillac DTS.[123] In contrast to that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, he stated he uses Google as his preferred search engine.[124] In 2013 he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire life.[125] Buffett reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the Omaha World Herald, which his company acquired in 2011.\nBuffett's speeches are known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett presides over Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in the Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska, an event drawing over 20,000 visitors from both the United States and abroad, giving it the nickname \"Woodstock of Capitalism\". Berkshire's annual reports and letters to shareholders, prepared by Buffett, frequently receive coverage by the financial media. Buffett's writings are known for containing quotations from sources as varied as the Bible and Mae West,[126] as well as advice in a folksy, Midwestern style and numerous jokes.\nIn April 2017, Buffett (an avid Coca-Cola drinker and investor in the company) agreed to have his likeness placed on Cherry Coke products in China. Buffett was not compensated for this advertisement.[127][128]\nOn April 11, 2012, Buffett was diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer during a routine test.[129] He announced he would begin two months of daily radiation treatment from mid-July.  In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said he felt \"great - as if I were in my normal excellent health - and my energy level is 100 percent.\" On September 15, 2012, Buffett announced that he had completed the full 44-day radiation treatment cycle, saying \"it's a great day for me\" and \"I am so glad to say that's over.\"[130]\n In 2008, Buffett was ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of approximately $62 billion.[131] In 2009, after donating billions of dollars to charity, he was ranked as the second richest man in the United States with a net worth of $37\u00a0billion[132][133] with only Bill Gates ranked higher than Buffett. His net worth had risen to $58.5\u00a0billion as of September 2013.[134]\nIn 1999, Buffett was named the top money manager of the Twentieth Century in a survey by the Carson Group, ahead of Peter Lynch and John Templeton.[135] In 2007, he was listed among Time's 100 Most Influential People in the world.[136] In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[137] Buffett, along with Bill Gates, was named the most influential global thinker in Foreign Policy's 2010 report.[138]\nBuffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents.[139] His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. He once commented, \"I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing\".[140]\nBuffett had long stated his intention to give away his fortune to charity, and in June 2006, he announced a new plan to give 83% of it to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.[141] He pledged about the equivalent of 10\u00a0million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (worth approximately $30.7\u00a0billion as of June 23, 2006),[142] making it the largest charitable donation in history, and Buffett one of the leaders of philanthrocapitalism.[143] The foundation will receive 5% of the total each July, beginning in 2006. (The pledge is conditional upon the foundation's giving away each year, beginning in 2009, an amount that is at least equal to the value of the entire previous year's gift from Buffett, in addition to 5% of the foundation's net assets.) Buffett joined the Gates Foundation's board, but did not plan to be actively involved in the foundation's investments.[144][145]\nThis represented a significant shift from Buffett's previous statements, to the effect that most of his fortune would pass to his Buffett Foundation.[146] The bulk of the estate of his wife, valued at $2.6\u00a0billion, went there when she died in 2004.[147] He also pledged $50\u00a0million to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in Washington, where he began serving as an adviser in 2002.[148]\nIn 2006, he auctioned his 2001 Lincoln Town Car[149] on eBay to raise money for Girls, Inc.[150] In 2007, he auctioned a luncheon with himself that raised a final bid of $650,100 for the Glide Foundation.[151] Later auctions raised $2.1\u00a0million[152][153] $1.7\u00a0million[154] and $3.5\u00a0million. The winners traditionally dine with Buffett at New York's Smith and Wollensky steak house. The restaurant donates at least $10,000 to Glide each year to host the meal.[155]\nIn 2009, Ralph Nader wrote the book \"Only the Super Rich Can Save Us,\" a novel about \"a movement of billionaires led by Warren Buffett and featuring, among others, Ted Turner, George Soros and Barry Diller, who use their fortunes to clean up America.\".[156] On C-SPAN BookTV, Nader said Buffett invited him to breakfast after the book came out and was \"quite intrigued by the book.\" He also told Nader of his plan to get \"billionaires all over the world to donate 50% of their estate to charity or good works.\" [157] On December 9, 2010, Buffett, Bill Gates, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a promise they called the \"Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge\", in which they promise to donate to charity at least half of their wealth, and invite other wealthy people to follow suit.[14][158] In 2018, after making almost $3.4\u00a0billion donations,[159] Buffet was ranked 3rd in the Forbes' List of Billionaire 2018.[160]\nWarren Buffett continues to help fund and support his family's individual foundations which include Susan Buffett's Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, Susan Alice Buffett's Sherwood Foundation, Howard Graham Buffett's Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and Peter Buffett's NoVo Foundation.[161][162] Warren Buffett is also supportive of his sister Doris Buffett's Letters Foundation and Learning By Giving Foundation.[163][164]\nIn addition to political contributions over the years, Buffett endorsed and made campaign contributions to Barack Obama's presidential campaign. On July 2, 2008, Buffett attended a $28,500 per plate fundraiser for Obama's campaign in Chicago.[165] Buffett intimated that John McCain's views on social justice were so far from his own that McCain would need a \"lobotomy\" for Buffett to change his endorsement.[166] During the second 2008 U.S. presidential debate, McCain and Obama, after being asked first by presidential debate mediator Tom Brokaw, both mentioned Buffett as a possible future Secretary of the Treasury.[167] Later, in the third and final presidential debate, Obama mentioned Buffett as a potential economic advisor.[168] Buffett was also finance advisor to California Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger during his 2003 election campaign.[169]\nOn December 16, 2015, Buffett endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president.[15] On August 1, 2016, Buffett challenged Donald Trump to release his tax returns.[170][171] On October 10, 2016, after another reference to him in the 2nd 2016 presidential debate, Buffett released his own tax return.[172][173] He said he had paid $1.85\u00a0million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6\u00a0million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8\u00a0billion worth of donations last year.[173] Buffett said, \"I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump -- at least he would have no legal problem.\" This was a response to Trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit.[173]\nBuffett described the health care reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage.[174] Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs.[174] Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP.[175] (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.)[176] Buffett said \"If you want the very best, I mean if you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best\", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).[177]\nBuffett faults the incentives in the United States medical industry, that payers reimburse doctors for procedures (fee-for-service) leading to unnecessary care (overutilization), instead of paying for results.[178] He cited Atul Gawande's 2009 article in the New Yorker[179] as a useful consideration of US health care, with its documentation of unwarranted variation in Medicare expenditures between McAllen, Texas and El Paso, Texas.[178] Buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry, saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income.[180]\nBuffett stated that he only paid 19% of his income for 2006 ($48.1\u00a0million) in total federal taxes (due to their source as dividends and capital gains), while his employees paid 33% of theirs, despite making much less money.[181] \"How can this be fair?\" Buffett asked, regarding how little he pays in taxes compared to his employees. \"How can this be right?\" He also added, \"There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.\"[182][183] After Donald Trump accused him of taking \"massive deductions,\" Buffett countered, \"I have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward.\"[184]\nBuffett favors the inheritance tax, saying that repealing it would be like \"choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics\".[185] In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy.[186] Some critics argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments.[187]\nBuffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling, or legalizing casinos, calling it a tax on ignorance.[188]\nBuffett viewed the United States' expanding trade deficit as a trend that will devalue the US dollar and US assets. He predicted that the US dollar will lose value in the long run, as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of US assets in the hands of foreigners. In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, he predicted that in another ten years' time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11\u00a0trillion.\nAmericans\u00a0... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an 'ownership society' will not find happiness in \u2013 and I'll use hyperbole here for emphasis\u00a0\u2013 a 'sharecropping society'.The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett has been critical of gold as an investment,his critique being based primarily on its non-productive nature. In a 1998 address at Harvard, Buffett said:\nIt gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:\nStocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation \u2013 at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.[189]Buffett invested in PetroChina Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary[190] on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the Sudanese civil war that caused Harvard to divest. He sold this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008.\nIn October 2008, Buffett invested $230\u00a0million for 10% of battery maker BYD Company (SEHK:\u00a01211), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer BYD Auto. In less than one year, the investment reaped over 500% return.[191]\nIn May 2018, BYD's shares had a substantial fall with a total net investment loss of $9\u00a0billion. This was Buffett's worst investment in China.[192]\nDuring the RJR Nabisco, Inc. hostile takeover fight in 1987, Buffett was quoted as telling John Gutfreund:[193]\nI'll tell you why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It's addictive. And there's fantastic brand loyalty.\nSpeaking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s 1994 annual meeting, Buffett said investments in tobacco are:[194]\nfraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration. I would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses. The economy of the business may be fine, but that doesn't mean it has a bright future.\nIn 2007, Buffett's PacifiCorp, a subsidiary of his MidAmerican Energy Company, canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah's Intermountain Power Project Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp's Integrated Resource Plan. The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups.[195]\nNative American tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the Klamath River. David Sokol responded on Buffett's behalf, stating that the FERC would decide the question.[196][197]\nIn December 2011, Buffett's MidAmerican Energy Holdings agreed to buy a $2\u00a0billion solar energy project under development in California and a 49 percent stake in a $1.8\u00a0billion plant in Arizona, his first investments in solar power. He already owned wind farms.[198]\nHe has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements. At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the Indiana House of Representatives to change the value of Pi from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat.[199]\nWhen a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don't belong in the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong?[200]In May 2012, Buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new social media companies such as Facebook and Google because it is hard to estimate future value. He also stated that initial public offering (IPO) of stock are almost always bad investments. Investors should be looking to companies that will have good value in ten years.[201]\nIn an interview with CNBC in January 2018, Buffett said that the recent craze over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won't end well, adding that \"when it happens or how or anything else, I don't know.\" But he said he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures.[202]\nIn terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending.Aside from countless television appearances on various news programs, Buffett has appeared in numerous films and TV programs, both documentary and fiction. He has been a guest 10 times on Charlie Rose, and was the subject of the HBO documentary feature Becoming Warren Buffett (2017) and the BBC production The World's Greatest Money Maker (2009).\nIn October 2008, USA Today reported at least 47 books were in print with Buffett's name in the title. The article quoted the CEO of Borders Books, George Jones, as saying that the only other living persons named in as many book titles were U.S. presidents, world political figures and the Dalai Lama.[203] Buffett said that his own personal favorite is a collection of his essays called The Essays of Warren Buffett,[204] which he described as \"a coherent rearrangement of ideas from my annual report letters\".[203]\nBooks or publications by Buffett:\nSome best-selling, or otherwise notable, books about Buffett:\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nMichael Rubens Bloomberg[2] (born February 14, 1942) is an American politician, businessman, and author. Bloomberg was the mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013 and is currently a candidate in the Democratic Party primaries for the 2020 United States presidential election. Bloomberg grew up in Medford, Massachusetts and attended Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School. He began his career at the securities brokerage Salomon Brothers, before forming his own company in 1981, Bloomberg L.P., a global financial services, software and mass media company that bears his name, and is known for its Bloomberg Terminal, a computer software system providing financial data widely used in the global financial services industry. He spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. As of November 2019, this made him the ninth-richest person in the United States and the 14th-richest person in the world; his net worth was estimated at $58 billion.[3] Since signing The Giving Pledge whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth, Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.[4] He has given more than $3.3 billion to Johns Hopkins University, including his $1.8 billion gift in 2018 for student financial aid which was the largest private donation in modern times to higher education.[5] Bloomberg served as the 108th mayor of New York City, holding office for three consecutive terms, two terms as a Republican and one as an Independent beginning his first in 2002. A lifelong Democrat before seeking elective office, Bloomberg switched his party registration in 2001 to run for mayor as a Republican. He defeated opponent Mark J. Green in a close election held just weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks. He won a second term in 2005 and left the Republican Party two years later. Bloomberg campaigned to change the city's term limits law and was elected to his third term in 2009 as an independent on the Republican ballot line. His final term as mayor ended on December 31, 2013. Bloomberg also served as chair of the board of trustees at his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, from 1996 to 2002. After a brief stint as a full-time philanthropist, Bloomberg re-assumed the position of CEO at Bloomberg L.P. by the end of 2014. Bloomberg officially launched his campaign for the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2020 presidential election on November 24, 2019, following weeks of speculation that he would join the race as a late entry.[6] Bloomberg was born at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, in Brighton, a neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, on February 14, 1942, to William Henry Bloomberg (1906\u20131963), a bookkeeper for a dairy company,[7] and Charlotte (Rubens) Bloomberg (1909\u20132011).[8][9] The Bloomberg Center at the Harvard Business School was named in William Henry's honor.[10] His family is Jewish. He is a member of the Emanu-El Temple in Manhattan.[11] Bloomberg's paternal grandfather, Alexander \"Elick\" Bloomberg, was an immigrant from Russia.[2] Bloomberg's maternal grandfather, Max Rubens, was an immigrant from what is present-day Belarus.[12][13] The family lived in Allston until Bloomberg was two years old, when they moved to Brookline, Massachusetts, for the next two years, finally settling in the Boston suburb of Medford, Massachusetts, where he lived until after he graduated from college.[14] Bloomberg is an Eagle Scout.[15][16] Bloomberg attended Johns Hopkins University, where he joined the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. In 1962, as a sophomore, he constructed the school mascot's (the blue jay's) costume.[17] He graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. In 1966, he graduated from Harvard Business School with a Master of Business Administration.[18][19] In 1973, Bloomberg became a general partner at Salomon Brothers, a large Wall Street investment bank, where he headed equity trading and, later, systems development. In 1981, Salomon Brothers was bought[20] by Phibro Corporation, and Bloomberg was laid off from the investment bank.[21] He was given no severance package, but owned $10 million worth of equity as a partner at the firm.[22] Using this money, Bloomberg, having designed in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon, went on to set up a company named Innovative Market Systems (IMS). His business plan was based on the realization that Wall Street (and the financial community generally) was willing to pay for high-quality business information, delivered as quickly as possible and in as many usable forms possible, via technology (e.g., graphs of highly specific trends).[23] Bloomberg, along with Thomas Secunda, Duncan MacMillan, and Charles Zegar, developed and built a computerized system to provide real-time market data, financial calculations and other financial analytics to Wall Street firms. The machines were first called \"Market Master Terminals\" and later on became known as \"Bloomberg Terminals.\" In 1983, Merrill Lynch became the company's first customer, investing $30 million in IMS to help finance the development of \"the Bloomberg\" terminal computer system and by 1984, IMS was selling machines to all of Merrill Lynch's clients. The company was renamed Bloomberg L.P. in 1987.[24] By 1990, it had installed 8,000 terminals.[25] Over the years, ancillary products including Bloomberg News, Bloomberg Message, and Bloomberg Tradebook were launched.[26] As of October 2015, the company had more than 325,000 terminal subscribers worldwide.[27] Subscriptions cost $24,000 per year, discounted to $20,000 for two or more.[28] As of 2019, Bloomberg employs 20,000 people in dozens of locations.[28] The company earned approximately $10 billion in 2018, loosely $3 billion more than Thomson Reuters, now Refinitiv, its nearest competitor.[28] His company also has a radio network that currently has 1130 WBBR AM in New York City as its flagship station. When he left the position of CEO to pursue a political career as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg was replaced as CEO by Lex Fenwick.[29] During Bloomberg's three mayoral terms, the company was led by president Daniel L. Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor under Bloomberg.[30] After completing his final term as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg spent his first eight months out of office as a full-time philanthropist. In fall 2014, he announced that he would return to Bloomberg L.P. as CEO at the end of 2014,[31] succeeding Doctoroff, who had led the company since retiring from the Bloomberg administration in February 2008.[31][32][33] Bloomberg still owns the business but resigned as CEO of Bloomberg L.P. to run for President in 2019.[28] Bloomberg is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[34] He wrote an autobiography, with help from Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler, called Bloomberg by Bloomberg.[35] In March 2009, Forbes reported Bloomberg's wealth at $16 billion, a gain of $4.5 billion over the previous year, the world's biggest increase in wealth in 2009.[36] At that time, there were only four fortunes in the U.S. that were larger (although the Walmart family fortune is split among four people). He had moved from 142nd to 17th in the Forbes list of the world's billionaires in only two years.[37][38] Subsequently, Forbes reported his wealth at $22 billion, then $31 billion, then $43.3 billion, and ranked him 11th-, then 10th-, then 6th-richest in the U.S.[24][39][40] As of November 2019, Bloomberg was the 14th richest person in the world, with a net worth estimated at $58 billion.[3] Bloomberg assumed office as the 108th Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2002. He won re-election in 2005 and again in 2009. As mayor, Bloomberg initially struggled with a low approval rating from the public; however, he subsequently developed and maintained high approval ratings.[41] His re-election meant the Republicans had won the previous four mayoral elections (although Bloomberg's decision to leave the Republican Party and be declared an independent on June 19, 2007, resulted in the Republican Party's losing the mayor's seat prior to the expiration of his second term). Bloomberg joined Rudy Giuliani and Fiorello La Guardia as re-elected Republican mayors in the mostly Democratic city. Bloomberg stated that he wanted public education reform to be the legacy of his first term and addressing poverty to be the legacy of his second.[42] According to the National Assessment of Educational Performance, fourth-grade reading scores from 2002 to 2009 rose nationally by 11 points, but in May 2010, The New York Times reported that eighth-graders had shown no significant improvement in math or reading. Bloomberg chose to apply a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what New York Times political reporter Adam Nagourney called a \"bullpen\" open office plan, similar to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.[43] In efforts to create \"cutbacks\" in the New York City Spending Bracket, Bloomberg declined to receive a city salary. He accepted a remuneration of $1 annually for his services.[44] In 2001, the incumbent mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, was ineligible for re-election, as the city limited the mayoralty to two consecutive terms. Several well-known New York City politicians aspired to succeed him. Bloomberg, a lifelong member of the Democratic Party, decided to run for mayor as a member of the Republican Party ticket. Voting in the primary began on the morning of September 11, 2001. The primary was postponed later that day, due to the September 11 attacks. In the rescheduled primary, Bloomberg defeated Herman Badillo, a former Democratic congressman, to become the Republican nominee. Meanwhile, the Democratic primary did not produce a first-round winner. After a runoff, the Democratic nomination went to New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. In the general election, Bloomberg received Giuliani's endorsement. He also had a huge spending advantage. Although New York City's campaign finance law restricts the amount of contributions that a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions. He spent $73 million of his own money on his campaign, outspending Green five to one.[45] One of the major themes of his campaign was that, with the city's economy suffering from the effects of the World Trade Center attacks, it needed a mayor with business experience. In addition to serving as the Republican nominee, Bloomberg had the ballot line of the controversial Independence Party, in which \"Social Therapy\" leaders Fred Newman and Lenora Fulani exert strong influence. Some[who?] say that endorsement was important, as Bloomberg's votes on that line exceeded his margin of victory over Green. (Under New York's fusion rules, a candidate can run on more than one party's line and combine all the votes received on all lines. Green, the Democrat, had the ballot line of the Working Families Party). Bloomberg also created an independent line called Students First whose votes were combined with those on the Independence line. Another factor was the vote in Staten Island, which has traditionally been far friendlier to Republicans than the rest of the city. Bloomberg handily beat Green in that borough, taking 75 percent of the vote. Overall, Bloomberg won 50 percent to 48 percent.[citation needed] Bloomberg's election marked the first time in New York City history that two different Republicans had been elected mayor consecutively. New York City has not been won by a Republican in a presidential election year since Calvin Coolidge won in 1924. Bloomberg is considered a social liberal, who is pro-choice, in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and an advocate for stricter gun control laws. Although 68 percent of New York City's registered voters are Democrats, Bloomberg decided the city should host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The convention drew thousands of protesters, many of them local residents angry over the Iraq war and other issues. The New York Police Department arrested approximately 1,800 protesters, but according to The New York Times, more than 90 percent of the cases were later dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence.[46] Bloomberg was re-elected mayor in November 2005 by a margin of 20 percent, the widest margin ever for a Republican mayor of New York City.[47] He spent almost $78 million on his campaign, exceeding the record of $74 million he spent on the previous election. In late 2004 or early 2005, Bloomberg gave the Independence Party of New York $250,000 to fund a phone bank seeking to recruit volunteers for his re-election campaign.[48] Former Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer won the Democratic nomination to oppose Bloomberg in the general election. Thomas Ognibene sought to run against Bloomberg in the Republican Party's primary election.[49] The Bloomberg campaign successfully challenged enough of the signatures Ognibene had submitted to the Board of Elections to prevent Ognibene from appearing on ballots for the Republican primary.[49] Instead, Ognibene ran on only the Conservative Party ticket.[50] Ognibene accused Bloomberg of betraying Republican Party ideals, a feeling echoed by others.[51][52][53][54] Bloomberg opposed the confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States.[55] Though a Republican at the time, Bloomberg is a staunch supporter of abortion rights and did not believe that Roberts was committed to maintaining Roe v. Wade.[55] In addition to Republican support, Bloomberg obtained the endorsements of several prominent Democrats: former Democratic Mayor Ed Koch; former Democratic governor Hugh Carey; former Democratic City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, and his son, Councilman Peter Vallone Jr.; former Democratic Congressman Floyd Flake (who had previously endorsed Bloomberg in 2001), and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz.[56] On October 2, 2008, Bloomberg announced he would seek to extend the city's term limits law and run for a third mayoral term in 2009, arguing a leader of his field was needed following the financial crisis of 2007\u201308. \"Handling this financial crisis while strengthening essential services\u00a0... is a challenge I want to take on,\" Bloomberg said at a news conference. \"So should the City Council vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if I have earned another term.\"[57] Ronald Lauder, who campaigned for New York City's term limits in 1993 and spent over 4 million dollars of his own money to limit the maximum years a mayor could serve to eight years,[58] sided with Bloomberg in running for a third term and agreed to stay out of future legality issues.[59] In exchange, he was promised a seat on an influential city board by Bloomberg.[60] Some people and organizations objected and NYPIRG filed a complaint with the City Conflict of Interest Board.[61] On October 23, 2008, the City Council voted 29\u201322 in favor of extending the term limit to three consecutive four-year terms, thus allowing Bloomberg to run for office again.[62] After two days of public hearings, Bloomberg signed the bill into law on November 3.[63] Bloomberg's bid for a third term generated some controversy. Civil libertarians such as former New York Civil Liberties Union Director Norman Siegel and New York Civil Rights Coalition Executive Director Michael Meyers joined with local politicians such as New York State Senator Eric Adams to protest the term-limits extension.[64] Bloomberg's opponent was Democratic and Working Families Party nominee Bill Thompson, who had been New York City Comptroller for the past eight years and before that, president of the New York City Board of Education.[65] Bloomberg defeated Thompson by a vote of 51% to 46%.[66] After the release of Independence Party campaign filings in January 2010, it was reported that Bloomberg had made two $600,000 contributions from his personal account to the Independence Party on October 30 and November 2, 2009.[67] The Independence Party then paid $750,000 of that money to Republican Party political operative John Haggerty Jr.[68] This prompted an investigation beginning in February 2010 by the office of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. into possible improprieties.[69] The Independence Party later questioned how Haggerty spent the money, which was to go to poll-watchers.[70] Former New York State Senator Martin Connor contended that because the Bloomberg donations were made to an Independence Party housekeeping account rather than to an account meant for current campaigns, this was a violation of campaign finance laws.[71] Haggerty also spent money from a separate $200,000 donation from Bloomberg on office space.[72] On March 5, 2019, Bloomberg had announced that he would not run for president in 2020; instead he encouraged the Democratic Party to \"nominate a Democrat who will be in the strongest position to defeat Donald Trump.\"[73] However, due to his dissatisfaction with the Democratic field, Bloomberg reconsidered. He officially launched his campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination on November 24, 2019.[74] Bloomberg is financing his campaign personally and has said he won't accept donations.[75] As of December 31, 2019 - five weeks after declaring his candidacy - he had spent or committed $200 million, mostly on television advertising, producing \"an onslaught of campaign commercials with no precedent in Democratic politics\".[76] By mid January 2020 he was polling in the high single digits, ranking fourth among the Democratic candidates in one poll.[77][78] Bloomberg has been a registered Democrat for most of his life. He is regarded as socially liberal or progressive on multiple issues, supporting abortion rights, same-sex marriage, strict gun control measures, environmentalism and a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. On economics and foreign policy issues, Bloomberg has tended towards a moderate stance. He opposed a timeline for withdrawal from the Iraq War, and criticized those who favored one. Economically, he supports government involvement in issues such as public welfare while being strongly in favor of free trade and being pro-business, describing himself as a fiscal conservative because he balanced New York City's budget.[79] He is concerned about climate change and has touted his mayoral efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.[80] Bloomberg has been criticized for not allowing many emergency officials who responded to the September 11, 2001, attacks to attend the tenth anniversary observation of that day.[81] He was also at odds with many around the U.S. for not inviting any clergy to the ceremony marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.[82] Bloomberg supports abortion rights, stating, \"Reproductive choice is a fundamental human right and we can never take it for granted. On this issue, you're either with us or against us.\" He has criticized \"pro-choice\" politicians who support \"pro-life\" candidates.[83] Bloomberg supports governmental funding for embryonic stem cell research, calling the Republican position on the issue \"insanity\".[84] He supports same-sex marriage with the rationale that \"government shouldn't tell you whom to marry.\"[85] Bloomberg supports the strict drug laws of New York City. He has stated that he smoked marijuana in the past, and was quoted in a 2001 interview as saying \"You bet I did. I enjoyed it.\" This led to a reported $500,000 advertising campaign by NORML, featuring his image and the quote. Bloomberg stated in a 2002 interview that he regretted the remark and did not believe that marijuana should be decriminalized.[86] In 2012, Bloomberg backed an effort by Governor Andrew Cuomo to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana.[87] In January 2019, Bloomberg said \u201cLast year, in 2017, 72,000 Americans OD\u2019d [overdosed] on drugs. In 2018, more people than that are OD-ing on drugs, have OD\u2019d on drugs, and today, incidentally, we are trying to legalize another addictive narcotic, which is perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done.\"[88][89] In December 2019, Bloomberg came out in favor of marijuana decriminalization and allowing states to legalize it without federal intervention.[90] In April 2006, along with Boston mayor Thomas Menino, Bloomberg co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns.[91][92] A December 2013 press release by the group said the bipartisan coalition included over 1,000 mayors.[91] In 2014, the organization merged with Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America to form Everytown for Gun Safety,[93] which in 2018 in collaboration with student groups organized the March For Our Lives.[94] When asked in an April 2014 interview why he was devoting so many of his personal resources to supporting gun control, restrictive food choice and smoking cessation, his concern was about his mortality, replying \"I am telling you if there is a God, when I get to heaven I\u2019m not stopping to be interviewed. I am heading straight in. I have earned my place in heaven. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d[95] As mayor, Bloomberg increased the mandatory minimum sentence for illegal possession of a loaded handgun, saying, \"Illegal guns don't belong on our streets and we're sending that message loud and clear. We're determined to see that gun dealers who break the law are held accountable, and that criminals who carry illegal loaded guns serve serious time behind bars.\"[96] He opposes the death penalty, saying he would \"rather lock somebody up and throw away the key and put them in hard labor\".[96] He has called the death penalty \"murder by the state\".[97] Bloomberg was a staunch proponent of stop-and-frisk in New York City and has argued that it lowered the murder rate.[98] The manner in which the NYPD utilized the practice was ruled unconstitutional in 2013, but the practice itself was not deemed unconstitutional.[99][100] There is no evidence that the practice reduced the crime rate.[101] However, in 2018 Bloomberg said of stop-and-frisk, \"The history of the decline in police stops is misunderstood. As crime hit historic lows, and more than a year before any court ruling, I pledged to a Sunday congregation in Brooklyn and to all New Yorkers that 'we must and will do better' by reforming police practices while continuing to drive down crime. And that's exactly what we did, on our own accord. We cut police stops by 94 percent, while continuing to reduce crime and incarceration.\"[102] On November 17, 2019, while speaking in Brooklyn's non-denominational Christian Cultural Center, Bloomberg renounced his previous support for stop-and-frisk and issued an apology.[103][104] New York Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Bloomberg's apology by stating \"This is LONG overdue and the timing is transparent and cynical.\"[105] Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch also criticized Bloomberg's apology, noting in a statement that, \"We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities,\u201d and that the \"[Bloomberg] administration\u2019s misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe.\u201d[106] Bloomberg replaced New York City's school board set up by the state of New York with a setup providing direct mayoral control over public education.[107][108] This was criticized by some, such as former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch who has argued that mayoral control led to further privatization of education.[109] Bloomberg states that he raised the salaries of teachers by fifteen percent while boosting test scores and graduation rates.[110][111] Some, such as the United Federation of Teachers, dispute these claims, criticizing Bloomberg for including things that do not show up on a paycheck, such as increased spending on teachers' pensions and healthcare, which they say inflate the amount teachers' salaries were raised; they also accuse him of exaggerating the boost in graduation rates and the role his administration played in it, pointing out that New York City's graduation rates still far lagged behind the rest of New York State.[112][113][114] Bloomberg opposes social promotion, stating that students should be promoted only when they are adequately prepared for the next grade level. Some educators disagree, however, arguing that leaving children behind stigmatizes them as failures, only to face failure again as they repeat the grade.[115] He favors after-school programs to help students who are behind. As mayor, Bloomberg strengthened the cellphone ban in schools.[116] In Los Angeles, Bloomberg waded into the controversy over the proliferation of charter schools, donating over $1 million to elect pro-charter school board candidates opposed by United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA).[117] During his second term as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg unveiled PlaNYC: A Greener, Greater New York on April 22, 2007, to fight global warming, protect the environment and prepare for the projected 1 million additional people expected to be living in the city by the year 2030.[118] Under PlaNYC, in just six years New York City reduced citywide greenhouse gas emissions by 19% since 2005 and was on track to achieve a 30% reduction ahead of the PlaNYC 2030 goal.[119] In October 2007, as part of PlaNYC, Bloomberg launched the Million Trees NYC initiative, which aimed to plant and care for one million trees throughout the city in the next decade. In November 2015, New York City planted its one millionth tree, two years ahead of the original 10-year schedule.[120] In 2008, Bloomberg convened the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), an effort to prepare the city for climate change.[121] In 2012, Travel + Leisure readers voted New York City the \"Dirtiest American City,\" for having the most extant litter.[122] Bloomberg has been involved in motivating other cities to make changes and has spoken about reducing carbon dioxide emissions, using cleaner and more efficient fuels, using congestion pricing in New York City, and encouraging public transportation.[123] Bloomberg unveiled the Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency (SIRR) in June 2013, after the city was affected by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The $20 billion initiative laid out extensive plans to protect New York City against future impacts of climate change.[124] On September 26, 2013, Bloomberg announced that his administration's air pollution reduction efforts had resulted in the best air quality in New York City in more than 50 years.[125] The majority of the air quality improvement was attributed to the phasing out of heavy polluting heating oils through New York's \"Clean Heat\" program.[126] As a result of the improved air quality, the average life expectancy of New Yorkers had increased three years during Bloomberg's tenure, compared to 1.8 years in the rest of the country.[127] By 2017 Bloomberg donated 100 million dollars to the campaign Beyond Coal, that helped close over half of the US coal power stations, since 2011 when it was expanded due to his financial help. In 2017 he donated 64 million dollars more, the day after EPA head Scott Pruitt began to abolish President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan.[128] In 2019 Bloomberg, with the Sierra Club and other organizations, launched \"Beyond Carbon,\" an initiative to complete the USA's transition to non-fossil energy sources.[129] Bloomberg and former California Governor Jerry Brown launched and are leading America's Pledge, a coalition of cities, businesses, states and more in the US to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[130][131] The organization covers 68% of the GDP and 65% of the population of the United States. In COP25 it presented a report named \"ACCELERATING AMERICA\u2019S PLEDGE,\" in which it stated that already existing commitments can cut USA greenhouse gas emissions by 19% by 2025 and by 25% by 2030. Accelerating local action can lower emissions by 37% by the year 2030, and if federal support will be adjusted, by 49% by the same year relative to the level of the year 2005.[132][133] See further information in the section: \"Environmental Advocacy\" in this page. Bloomberg has criticized those who advocate for mass deportation of illegal immigrants, calling their stance unrealistic, \"We're not going to deport 12 million people, so let's stop this fiction. Let's give them permanent status.\"[134] He supports a federal ID database that uses DNA and fingerprint technology to keep track of all citizens and to verify their legal status.[135] Bloomberg has held that illegal immigrants should be offered legalization and supported the congressional efforts of John McCain and Ted Kennedy in their attempt at immigration reform in 2007.[136] Regarding border security, he compared it to the tide, stating, \"It's as if we expect border control agents to do what a century of communism could not: defeat the natural market forces of supply and demand ... and defeat the natural human desire for freedom and opportunity. You might as well as sit in your beach chair and tell the tide not to come in. As long as America remains a nation dedicated to the proposition that 'all Men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness', people from near and far will continue to seek entry into our country.\"[137] In 2006, Bloomberg stated on his weekly WABC radio show that illegal immigration does not strain the financial resources of New York City, since many immigrants are hard working and \"do not avail themselves of services until their situation is dire.\"[138][citation needed] In January 2011, city schools began a pilot program which allows girls over 14 years old to be provided with Plan B emergency contraception without parental consent, unless parents opt out in writing. Beginning with five schools, the pilot had been expanded to thirteen schools by September 2012.[139][140] On December 5, 2006, New York City under Bloomberg became the first city in the United States to ban trans fat from all restaurants. This went into effect in July 2008.[141] In September 2012, the city passed a law limiting the practice of circumcision among Orthodox Jews. The legislation requires that at each event, the mohel receives signed consent forms from the parents, acknowledging that they were notified of health risks associated with cleaning the wound by sucking blood from the male baby's organ. This regulation caused an outcry among certain Orthodox Jewish communities on this alleged infringement of their religious freedom,[142][143] and the matter was taken to federal court.[144] During the same month, the NYC Board of Health approved Bloomberg's proposal to ban the sale of many sweetened drinks more than 16 ounces (473ml) in volume. The limit would have applied to businesses such as restaurants and movie theaters, but did not apply to grocery stores, including 7-Eleven. Diet varieties of sweetened drinks were unaffected.[145] On March 12, 2013, hours before the ban was scheduled to take effect, State Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling struck it down, ruling that the Board of Health lacked the jurisdiction to enforce it and that the rule was \"arbitrary and capricious\". The city appealed the decision.[146] On July 30, the Appellate Division upheld the lower court's ruling, stating the Board of Health \"failed to act within the bounds of its lawfully delegated authority\" and the ban was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine, which reserves legislative power to the legislature and does not allow the board to \"exercise sweeping power to create whatever rule they deem necessary\". Bloomberg announced that the city would appeal the decision.[147] Bloomberg has been criticized for some of his policies which have been described by many as facilitating the creation of a nanny state.[148] Comedian Bill Maher, while on Jimmy Kimmel Live, said that Bloomberg's soda ban \"gives liberals a bad name\".[149] In response to the soda ban, The Center for Consumer Freedom ran a full-page ad in The New York Times featuring an image of Bloomberg's face superimposed on an elderly female body wearing a dress and scarf, with the title \"The Nanny\", and the tagline \"New Yorkers Need a Mayor, Not a Nanny.\"[150] Others have pointed out that the smoking rate dropped quickly during Bloomberg's time in office (which has involved the banning of smoking in certain areas).[148] Criticism of Bloomberg's attempt to ban the sale of large soft drinks was picked up, mostly by Republican and libertarian commentators and politicians, as a line of attack in political campaigns around the United States. In one example, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul brought Big Gulps to a joint appearance for Cuccinelli's ultimately unsuccessful 2013 gubernatorial campaign to symbolize Bloomberg's efforts to restrict soft drink sales, criticizing the mayor for wanting \"to buy the governor's office down here\", a reference to pro-gun control advertisements his political action committee was running in the state.[151] Republican legislators in Wisconsin reacted to the ban by inserting language to prohibit communities from restricting the sale of large soft drinks throughout the state in a 2013 budget bill.[152] Bloomberg believes that the September 11, 2001 attacks were not intended to be solitary events. When he assumed office, he set up a Counterterrorism Bureau which works along with the NYPD intelligence division to gather information about worldwide terrorism affecting New York City.[153] He believes that funding for Homeland Security by the federal government should be distributed by risk, where cities that are considered to have the highest threat for a terrorist attack would get the most money.[154] Bloomberg is also a supporter of the USA PATRIOT Act.[155] After the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombings, Bloomberg said that laws and the interpretation of the Constitution have to change to provide greater security against such attacks, \"the people who are worried about privacy have a legitimate worry, but we live in a complex world where you're going to have a level of security greater than you did back in the olden days, if you will\u00a0... our laws and our interpretation of the Constitution, I think, have to change.\"[156] Bloomberg characterizes himself as a fiscal conservative for turning the city's $6-billion deficit into a $3-billion surplus; however, conservative PAC Club for Growth has criticized him because he increased property taxes and spending while doing so. Being a fiscal conservative is not about slashing programs that help the poor, or improve health care, or ensure a social safety net. It's about insisting services are provided efficiently, get to only the people that need them, and achieve the desired results. Fiscal conservatives have hearts too\u00a0\u2013 but we also insist on using our brains, and that means demanding results and holding government accountable for producing them. To me, fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets\u00a0\u2013 not running deficits that the next generation can't afford. It means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you don't squander it. And most importantly, being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns\u00a0\u2013 and by all indications, we've got one coming. Bloomberg has expressed a distaste for taxes, stating, \"Taxes are not good things, but if you want services, somebody's got to pay for them, so they're a necessary evil.\"[157] As mayor, he did raise property taxes to fund budget projects; however, in January 2007, he proposed cuts in property taxes by five percent and cuts in sales taxes, including the elimination of taxes on clothing and footwear. Bloomberg pointed to the Wall Street profits and the real estate market as evidence that the city's economy is booming and could handle a tax break.[158] Bloomberg's self-described fiscal conservatism also led him to eliminate the existing $6-billion deficit when he assumed office. Bloomberg balanced the budget of New York City by raising property taxes and making cuts to city agencies.[159] Bloomberg is in favor of providing tax breaks to big corporations for the good of the whole community. As mayor, Bloomberg lobbied the CEO of Goldman Sachs to establish its headquarters across from Ground Zero by promising $1.65 billion in tax breaks. Regarding this deal, Bloomberg stated, \"This [New York City] is where the best want to live and work. So I told him [CEO of Goldman Sachs], 'We can help with minimizing taxes. Minimizing your rent. Improving security. But in the end, this is about people.'\"[160] Bloomberg had less cordial relations with unions as mayor. In 2002, when New York City's transit workers threatened to strike, Bloomberg responded by riding a mountain bike through the city to show how the city could deal with the transit strike by finding alternate means of transportation and not pandering to the unions.[161] Three years later, a clash over wages and union benefits led to a three-day strike. Negotiations led to the end of the strike in December 2005.[162] Bloomberg is a staunch advocate of free trade and is strongly opposed to protectionism, stating, \"The things that we have to worry about is this protectionist movement that has reared its head again in this country. ... \" He worries about the growth of China and fears the lessening gap between the United States and other countries, \"The rest of the world is catching up, and, there are people that say, surpassing us. I hope they are wrong. I hope those who think we are still in good shape are right. But nevertheless, the time to address these issues is right now.\"[163] Bloomberg has placed a strong emphasis on public health and welfare, adopting many liberal policies. As the mayor he made HIV, diabetes, and hypertension all top priorities. He extended the city's smoking ban to all commercial establishments and implemented a trans fat ban in restaurants.[164] Bloomberg has been a strong supporter of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation\u00a0\u2013 the largest urban healthcare agency in the United States\u00a0\u2013 serving over 1.3 million New Yorkers, and has touted its use of information technology and Electronic Health Records to increase efficiency and enhance patient care.[165] He launched a program called Opportunity NYC, the nation's first-ever conditional cash transfer pilot program, designed to help New Yorkers break the cycle of poverty in the city. He instituted a $7.5-billion municipal affordable housing plan, the largest in the nation, that is supposed to provide 500,000 New Yorkers with housing.[166] Bloomberg has expressed concern about poverty and growing class divisions, stating, \"This society cannot go forward, the way we have been going forward, where the gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing.\"[163] As mayor, Bloomberg made trips to Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Israel in the first four months of 2007.[167] In late 2007 he conducted an Asia trip that brought him to China, where he called for greater freedom of information to promote innovation. He attended the United Nations Climate Conference in Bali. Initially, Bloomberg strongly supported the war in Iraq and the rationale for going in. He stated, \"Don't forget that the war started not very many blocks from here,\"[168] alluding to Ground Zero. In regard to the global War on Terrorism including Iraq he said, \"It's not only to protect Americans. It's America's responsibility to protect people around the world who want to be free.\" During the 2004 presidential election campaign, New York City hosted the Republican National Convention at which Bloomberg endorsed President George W. Bush for President of the United States.[169] His enthusiasm seemed to have lessened somewhat over the course of the war. In August 2005, he said, \"I think everybody has very mixed emotions about the war that was started to find weapons of mass destruction and then they were not found.\"[170] Bloomberg expressed criticism of Democrats in Congress who wanted to set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, calling them \"irresponsible\".[171] In September 2019, Bloomberg said that the Communist Party of China \"listens to the public\" on pollution and stated Xi Jinping is not a dictator because he has to \"satisfy his constituents, or he's not going to survive...\" Bloomberg argued governments, even non-democratic governments, are not able to operate without the will of the majority of their people, so he predicted China will take further action to combat climate change.[172] In January 2020, Bloomberg came out in favor of sanctions on Chinese officials for \"human rights violations in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang.\"[173] Bloomberg is a proponent of large-scale development. He has repeatedly supported projects such as the Pacific Park mega-development, the Hudson Yards Redevelopment and associated rail-yard development (even supporting a subway extension to Hudson Yards), and the Harlem rezoning proposal.[174] On smaller-scale issues, Bloomberg usually takes the side of development as well. He favors the demolition of Admiral's Row[175] to build a supermarket parking lot. However, Bloomberg has occasionally sided with preservation, most notably in vetoing landmark revocation for the Austin Nichols warehouse.[176] This move was widely applauded by architectural historians. The City Council overruled the veto shortly thereafter, however.[177] On September 13, 2013, Bloomberg announced that he would not endorse any of the candidates to succeed him.[178][179] On his radio show, he stated, \"I don't want to do anything that complicates it for the next mayor. And that's one of the reasons I've decided I'm just not going to make an endorsement in the race.\" He added, \"I want to make sure that person is ready to succeed, to take what we've done and build on that.\"[180] Prior to the announcement in an interview in New York magazine, Bloomberg praised The New York Times for its endorsement of Christine Quinn and Joe Lhota as their favorite, respective, candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries.[181][182] Quinn came in third in the Democratic primary and Lhota won the Republican primary. Earlier in the month, Bloomberg was chastised in the press for his remarks regarding Democratic mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio's campaign methods.[183] Bloomberg said initially in a New York magazine interview that he considered de Blasio's campaign \"racist,\" and when asked about his comment, Bloomberg explained what he meant by his remark.[184] Well, no, no, I mean he's making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone watching what he's been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It's comparable to me pointing out I'm Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about.[184]On January 1, 2014, de Blasio became New York City's new mayor, succeeding Bloomberg.[185] In June 2018, Bloomberg made plans to give $80 million to support Democratic congressional candidates in the 2018 election, with the goal of flipping control of the Republican-controlled House to Democrats. In a statement, Bloomberg said that Republican House leadership were \"absolutely feckless\" and had failed to govern responsibly. Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson was chosen to lead the effort, which was to target mainly suburban districts.[186] By early October, Bloomberg had committed more than $100 million to returning the House and Senate to Democratic power, fueling speculation about a presidential run in 2020.[187] On October 10, 2018, Bloomberg announced that he had changed his political party affiliation to Democrat, which he had previously been registered as prior to 2001.[188] Bloomberg was frequently mentioned as a possible centrist candidate for the presidential elections in 2008 and 2012, as well as for governor of New York in 2010. He declined to seek either office, opting to continue serving as the mayor of New York City. There was widespread speculation that he would run as a third-party candidate in the 2016 presidential election, though he chose not to, later endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president. In October 2018, Bloomberg changed his political party affiliation back to the Democrats.[189] On February 27, 2008, Bloomberg announced that he would not run for president in 2008, and that he would endorse a candidate who took an independent and non-partisan approach.[190] He had also stated unequivocally, live on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, on December 31, 2007, that he was not going to run for president in 2008.[191] Despite prior public statements by Bloomberg denying plans for a presidential run,[192] many pundits believed Bloomberg would announce a campaign at a later date. On January 7, 2008, he met at the University of Oklahoma with a bipartisan group, including (now former) Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, both of whom had been frequently mentioned as possible running mates, to pressure the major-party candidates to promote national unity and reduce partisan gridlock. Speculation that Bloomberg would choose this forum to announce his candidacy proved to be unfounded.[193][194] In summer 2006, he met with Al From of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group, to talk about the logistics of a possible run.[195] After a conversation with Bloomberg, Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska suggested that he and Bloomberg could run on a shared independent ticket for the presidency.[196] On This Week on June 10, 2007, anchor George Stephanopoulos included panelist Jay Carney, who mentioned a conversation between Bloomberg and top staffers where he heard Bloomberg ask approximately how much a presidential campaign would cost. Carney said that one staffer replied, \"Around $500 million.\" According to a Washington Post article, a $500-million budget would allow Bloomberg to circumvent many of the common obstacles faced by third-party presidential candidates.[197] On June 19, 2007, Bloomberg left the Republican Party, filing as an independent after a speech criticizing the current political climate in Washington.[198][199] On August 9, 2007, in an interview with former CBS News anchor Dan Rather that aired on August 21, Bloomberg categorically stated that he was not running for president, that he would not be running, and that there were no circumstances in which he would, saying, \"If somebody asks me where I stand, I tell them. And that's not a way to get elected, generally. Nobody's going to elect me president of the United States. What I'd like to do is to be able to influence the dialogue. I'm a citizen.\"[200] Despite continued denials, a possible Bloomberg candidacy continued to be the subject of media attention, including a November Newsweek cover story.[201] During a private reception in December 2007, Bloomberg conducted a version of bingo in which guests were to guess the meaning of the numbers on a printed card. When Bloomberg asked the significance of 271, one guest answered correctly: the number of electoral votes received by George W. Bush in 2000.[202] In January 2008, CNN reported that a source close to Bloomberg said that the mayor had launched a research effort to assess his chances of winning a potential presidential bid. According to the report, the unidentified source also stated that Bloomberg had set early March as a timetable for making a decision as to whether or not to run.[203] On January 16, 2008, it was reported that Bloomberg's business interests were placed in \"a sort of blind trust\" because of his possible run for the presidency. His interests were put under the management of Quadrangle Group, co-founded by reported Bloomberg friend Steven Rattner, though Bloomberg would continue to control particular investment decisions.[204] In January 2008, the Associated Press reported that Bloomberg met with Clay Mulford, a ballot-access expert and campaign manager for Ross Perot's third-party presidential campaigns. Bloomberg denied that the meeting concerned a possible presidential campaign, and said the following month, \"I am not \u2013 and will not be \u2013 a candidate for president.\" He added that he is \"hopeful that the current campaigns can rise to the challenge by offering truly independent leadership. The most productive role that I can serve is to push them forward, by using the means at my disposal to promote a real and honest debate.\"[190] At the same time, there was also some speculation that Bloomberg could be a candidate for the vice presidency in 2008. In a blog posting of June 21, 2007, Ben Smith of The Politico asked the question of whether a vice-presidential candidate can self-finance an entire presidential ticket.[205] Bloomberg did not publicly endorse a candidate for the 2008 U.S. presidential election, but it has since been revealed that he voted for Barack Obama.[206] In November 2007, the New York Post detailed efforts by New York State Republicans to recruit Bloomberg to oppose Governor Eliot Spitzer in the 2010 election. Early polls indicated Bloomberg would defeat Spitzer in a landslide. (The potential 2010 match-up became moot when Spitzer resigned on March 17, 2008.)[207] A March 2008 poll of New York voters showed that, in a hypothetical 2010 gubernatorial matchup, Bloomberg would defeat Governor David Paterson (who became governor after Spitzer's resignation) and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the 2010 gubernatorial election.[208] Bloomberg did not run for governor.[209] In March 2010, Bloomberg's top political strategist Kevin Sheekey resigned from his mayoral advisory position and returned to Bloomberg LP, Bloomberg's company. It was speculated that the move would allow Sheekey to begin preliminary efforts for a Bloomberg presidential campaign in the 2012 election. An individual close to Bloomberg said, \"the idea of continuing onward is not far from his [Bloomberg's] mind.\"[210] In October 2010, the Committee to Draft Michael Bloomberg \u2013 which had attempted to recruit Bloomberg to run for the presidency in 2008 \u2013 announced it was relaunching its effort to persuade Bloomberg to wage a presidential campaign, in 2012.[211][212] The committee members insisted that they would persist in the effort in spite of Bloomberg's repeated denials of interest in seeking the presidency.[212][213] In a December 2010 appearance on Meet the Press, Bloomberg ruled out a run for the presidency in 2012.[214] In July 2011, in the midst of Democrats' and Republicans' inability to agree on a budget plan and thus an increase in the federal debt limit, the Washington Post published a blog post about groups organizing third party approaches. It focused on Bloomberg as the best hope for a serious third-party presidential candidacy in 2012.[215] In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012, Bloomberg penned an op-ed officially endorsing Barack Obama for president, citing Obama's policies on climate change.[216][217] On January 23, 2016, it was reported that Bloomberg was again considering a presidential run, as an independent candidate in the 2016 election.[218][219] This was the first time he had officially confirmed he was considering a run.[220] Bloomberg supporters believed that Bloomberg could run as a centrist and capture many voters who were dissatisfied with the likely Democratic and Republican nominees.[221] However, on March 7, Bloomberg announced he would not be running for president.[222][223] In July 2016, Bloomberg delivered a speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in which he called Hillary Clinton \"the right choice\".[224][225][226] In the speech, Bloomberg warned of the dangers a Donald Trump presidency would pose. He said Trump \"wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He's wrong on both counts.\" Bloomberg also said Trump's economic plans \"would make it harder for small businesses to compete\" and would \"erode our influence in the world\". Trump responded to the speech by condemning Bloomberg in a series of tweets.[224][227] Bloomberg is a dedicated environmentalist and has advocated policy to fight climate change at least since he became the mayor of New York City. At the national level, Bloomberg has consistently pushed for transitioning the United States' energy mix from fossil fuels to clean energy. In July 2011, Bloomberg donated $50 million through Bloomberg Philanthropies to Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, allowing the campaign to expand its efforts to shut down coal-fired power plants from 15 states to 45 states.[228][229] On April 8, 2015, to build on the success of the Beyond Coal campaign, Bloomberg announced an additional Bloomberg Philanthropies investment of $30 million in the Beyond Coal initiative, matched with another $30 million by other donors, to help secure the retirement of half of America's fleet of coal plants by 2017.[230] Bloomberg's personal life was criticized by InsideSources for contradicting his environmentalist image. Bloomberg owns a $30 million private jet, a $4.5 million helicopter that burns 72 gallons of fuel per hour, and several low-mpg vehicles, including an SUV and sports car. Bloomberg owns about ten properties, including at least three mansions. He flies to his waterfront mansion in Bermuda several times per month.[231][232] Bloomberg, through Bloomberg Philanthropies, awarded a $6 million grant to the Environmental Defense Fund in support of strict regulations on fracking, in the 14 states with the heaviest natural gas production.[233] In October 2013, Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the Risky Business initiative with former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer. The joint effort worked to convince the business community of the need for more sustainable energy and development policies, by quantifying and publicizing the economic risks the United States faces from the impact of climate change.[234] In January 2015, Bloomberg led Bloomberg Philanthropies in a $48-million partnership with the Heising-Simons family to launch the Clean Energy Initiative. The initiative supports state-based solutions aimed at ensuring America has a clean, reliable, and affordable energy system.[235] Since 2010, Bloomberg has taken an increasingly global role on environmental issues. From 2010 to 2013, he served as the chairman of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a network of the world's biggest cities working together to reduce carbon emissions.[236] During his tenure, Bloomberg worked with President Bill Clinton to merge C40 with the Clinton Climate Initiative, with the goal of amplifying their efforts in the global fight against climate change worldwide.[237] He serves as the president of the board of C40 Cities.[238] In January 2014, Bloomberg began a five-year commitment totaling $53 million through Bloomberg Philanthropies to the Vibrant Oceans Initiative. The initiative partners Bloomberg Philanthropies with Oceana, Rare, and Encourage Capital to help reform fisheries and increase sustainable populations worldwide.[239] In 2018, Bloomberg joined Ray Dalio in announcing a commitment of $185 million towards protecting the oceans.[240] On January 31, 2014, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed Bloomberg as his first Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change to help the United Nations work with cities to prevent climate change.[241] In September 2014, Bloomberg convened with Ban and global leaders at the UN Climate Summit to announce definite action to fight climate change in 2015.[242] Noting in March 2018 that \"climate change is running faster than we are,\" Ban's successor Ant\u00f3nio Guterres appointed Bloomberg as UN envoy for climate action.[243][244] He resigned on November 11, 2019, in the run-up to his presidential campaign.[245] In late 2014, Bloomberg, Ban Ki-moon, and global city networks ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), with support from UN-Habitat, launched the Compact of Mayors, a global coalition of mayors and city officials pledging to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate change, and track their progress transparently.[246] To date, over 250 cities representing more than 300 million people worldwide and 4.1% of the total global population, have committed to the Compact of Mayors,[247] which was merged with the Covenant of Mayors in June 2016.[248][249] On June 30, 2015, Bloomberg and mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo jointly announced the creation of the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, which convened on December 4, 2015.[250] The Climate Summit assembled hundreds of city leaders from around the world at Paris City Hall,[251][252] marking the largest recorded gathering of local leaders on the subject of fighting climate change.[253] The Summit concluded with the presentation of the Paris Declaration, a pledge by leaders from assembled global cities to cut carbon emissions by 3.7 gigatons annually by 2030.[254] During the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and chair of the Financial Stability Board, announced that Bloomberg will lead a new global task force designed to help industry and financial markets understand the growing risks of climate change.[255] Bloomberg and former Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope co-authored a book on climate change, \"Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet,\"[256] published by St. Martin's Press.[257] The book was released 18 April 2017 and appeared on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction best seller list.[258] Following the announcement that the U.S. government would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, Bloomberg outlined a coalition of cities, states, universities and businesses that had come together to honor America's commitment under the agreement through 'America's Pledge.'[259] Through Bloomberg Philanthropies, he offered \"up to $15 million to support the U.N. agency that helps countries implement the agreement.\"[260][261] About a month later, Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown announced that the America's Pledge coalition would work to \"quantify the actions taken by U.S. states, cities and business to drive down greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\"[262][263] In announcing the initiative, Bloomberg said \"the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but American society remains committed to it.\"[264] Two think-tanks, World Resource Institute and the Rocky Mountain Institute, will work with America's Pledge to analyze the work cities, states and businesses do to meet the U.S. commitment to the Paris agreement.[265] In May 2019, Bloomberg announced a 2020 Midwestern Collegiate Climate Summit in Washington University in St. Louis with the aim to bring together leaders from Midwestern universities, local government and the private sector to reduce climate impacts in the region.[266][267] In early June 2019, Bloomberg pledged $500 million to reduce climate impacts and shut remaining coal-fired power plants by 2030 via the new Beyond Carbon initiative.[268][269] On August 25, 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies and Harvard University announced the creation of the joint Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative.[270] Funded by a $32 million gift from Bloomberg, the Initiative will host up to 300 mayors and 400 staff from around the world over the next four years in executive training programs focused on increasing effective public sector management and innovation at the city level.[271] Bloomberg hosted the Global Business Forum on September 20, 2017. The event was held during the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly and featured international CEOs and heads of state.[272] The forum \"took place during the elite space once held by the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting,\" and former President Bill Clinton served as the first speaker.[273][274] The mission of the event was to discuss \"opportunities for advancing trade and economic growth, and the related societal challenges ...\"[274] In addition to Clinton and Bloomberg, speakers included Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, World Bank President Jim Kim, IMF head Christine Lagarde, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and French President Emmanuel Macron.[275][272] According to a profile of Bloomberg in Fast Company, his Bloomberg Philanthropies foundation has five areas of focus: public health, the arts, government innovation, the environment, and education.[276] According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Bloomberg was the third-largest philanthropic donor in America in 2015.[277] Through his Bloomberg Philanthropies Foundation, he has donated and/or pledged $240 million in 2005, $60 million in 2006, $47 million in 2007, $150 million in 2009, $332 million in 2010, $311 million in 2011, and $510M in 2015.[277][278] 2011 recipients included the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; World Lung Foundation and the World Health Organization. In 2013 it was reported that Bloomberg had donated $109.24 million in 556 grants and 61 countries to campaigns against tobacco.[24] According to The New York Times, Bloomberg was an \"anonymous donor\" to the Carnegie Corporation from 2001 to 2010, with gifts ranging from $5 million to $20 million each year.[279] The Carnegie Corporation distributed these contributions to hundreds of New York City organizations ranging from the Dance Theatre of Harlem to Gilda's Club, a non-profit organization that provides support to people and families living with cancer. He continues to support the arts through his foundation.[280] In 1996, Bloomberg endowed the William Henry Bloomberg Professorship at Harvard with a $3 million gift in honor of his father, who died in 1963, saying, \"throughout his life, he recognized the importance of reaching out to the nonprofit sector to help better the welfare of the entire community.\"[281] Bloomberg also endowed his hometown synagogue, Temple Shalom, which was renamed for his parents as the William and Charlotte Bloomberg Jewish Community Center of Medford.[282] Bloomberg reports giving $254 million in 2009 to almost 1,400 nonprofit organizations, saying, \"I am a big believer in giving it all away and have always said that the best financial planning ends with bouncing the check to the undertaker.\"[283] In July 2011, Bloomberg launched a $24 million initiative to fund \"Innovation Delivery Teams\" in five cities. The teams are one of Bloomberg Philanthropies' key goals: advancing government innovation.[284] In December 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched a partnership with online ticket search engine SeatGeek to connect artists with new audiences. Called the Discover New York Arts Project, the project includes organizations HERE, New York Theatre Workshop, and the Kaufman Center.[285] In his final term as mayor, Bloomberg earmarked a substantial appropriation to The Shed, a new arts center planned for Hudson Yards on the far west side of Manhattan.[286] He continued his support for The Shed after his time as mayor with a philanthropic donation of $75 million.[287] The Shed \"will present performances, concerts, visual art, music and other events.\"[288] On March 22, 2012, Bloomberg announced his foundation was pledging $220 million over four years in the fight against global tobacco use.[289] Bloomberg has donated $200 million toward the construction of new buildings at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In January 2013, Johns Hopkins University announced that with a recent $350 million gift, Bloomberg's total giving to his undergraduate alma mater surpassed $1.1 billion; his first gift to the school, 48 years prior, had been a $5 donation.[290] Five-sevenths of the $350 million gift is allocated to the Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships, endowing 50 Bloomberg Distinguished Professors (BDPs) whose interdisciplinary expertise crosses traditional academic disciplines.[291] In June 2015, Bloomberg donated $100 million to Cornell Tech, the applied sciences graduate school of Cornell University, to construct the first academic building on the school's Roosevelt Island campus. The building is named \"The Bloomberg Center.\"[292] In September 2016, on the School of Public Health's centennial anniversary Bloomberg Philanthropies contributed $300 million to establish the Bloomberg American Health Initiative, bringing his total lifetime contribution to the university to $1.5 billion.[293] On March 29, 2016, Bloomberg joined Vice President Joe Biden at Johns Hopkins University to announce the creation of The Bloomberg\u2013Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in East Baltimore.[294][295] The institute was launched with a $50 million gift by Bloomberg, a $50 million gift by philanthropist Sidney Kimmel, and $25 million from other donors.[296] It will support cancer therapy research, technology and infrastructure development, and private sector partnerships.[297] The institute embraces the spirit of Vice President Biden's \"cancer moonshot\" initiative, which seeks to find a cure for cancer through national coordination of government and private sector resources.[294] He is the founder of Everytown for Gun Safety (formerly Mayors Against Illegal Guns), a gun control advocacy group. On August 17, 2016, the World Health Organization appointed Bloomberg as its Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases.[298] In this role, Bloomberg will mobilize private sector and political leaders to help the WHO reduce deaths from preventable diseases, traffic accidents, tobacco, obesity, and alcohol. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan cited Bloomberg's ongoing support for WHO anti-smoking, drowning prevention, and road safety programs in her announcement of his new role.[299][300] In a ceremony on October 18, 2016, the Museum of Science, Boston announced a $50 million gift from Bloomberg.[301] The donation marks Bloomberg's fourth gift to the museum, which he credits with sparking his intellectual curiosity as a patron and student during his youth in Medford, Massachusetts.[302] The endowment will support and rename the museum's education division as the William and Charlotte Bloomberg Science Education Center, in honor of Bloomberg's parents. It is the largest donation in the museum's 186-year history.[303] On December 5, 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies became the largest funder of tobacco-control efforts in the developing world. The group announced a $360 million commitment on top of their pre-existing commitment, bringing his total contribution close to $1 billion. This new donation will help expand its previous work, such as having monitor tobacco use, introduce strong tobacco-control laws, and create mass media campaigns to educate the public about the dangers of tobacco use. The program includes 110 countries, among them China, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.[304] On November 18, 2018, Johns Hopkins announced a further gift of $1.8 billion from Bloomberg, marking the largest private donation in modern history to an institution of higher education and bringing Bloomberg's total contribution to the school in excess of $3.3 billion. Bloomberg's gift allows the school to practice need-blind admission and meet the full financial need of admitted students.[5] Bloomberg will spend $10 million on advertisements defending Democratic congresspersons who expect to suffer reelection difficulties for having voted for the impeachment of Donald Trump.[305] In 1975, Bloomberg married Susan Elizabeth Barbara Brown, a British national from Yorkshire, United Kingdom.[306] They had two daughters: Emma (born c. 1979) and Georgina (born 1983), who were featured on Born Rich, a documentary film about the children of the extremely wealthy. Bloomberg divorced Brown in 1993, but he has said she remains his \"best friend.\"[24] Since 2000, Bloomberg has lived with former New York state banking superintendent Diana Taylor.[307][308][309] Michael Bloomberg and his daughters own houses in Bermuda and stay there frequently.[310][311] His daughter Emma is married to Christopher Frissora, son of multimillionaire businessman Mark Frissora.[312] Although he attended Hebrew school, had a Bar Mitzvah, and his family kept a kosher kitchen, Bloomberg today is relatively secular, attending synagogue mainly during the High Holidays.[313] Neither of his daughters were raised Jewish.[313] Licensed as a private pilot,[314] Bloomberg pilots an AW109 helicopter, and as of 2012 was near the top of the waiting list for an AW609 tiltrotor aircraft.[315] In his youth he was a licensed amateur radio operator, was proficient in Morse code, and built ham radios.[316] His younger sister, Marjorie Tiven, has been Commissioner of the New York City Commission for the United Nations, Consular Corps and Protocol, since February 2002.[317] In 2013, he owned 13 properties in various countries around the world, including a mansion built in the Georgian style.[318][319] His newest acquisition is a historical property located in London that once belonged to writer George Eliot.[320] He maintains a public listing in the New York City phone directory,[321] and during his term as mayor, he lived not in Gracie Mansion \u2013 the official mayoral residence \u2013 but instead at his own home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In addition to his Bermuda home, he has homes in London, and Vail, Colorado.[322] Bloomberg stated that during his mayoralty, he rode the New York City Subway on a daily basis, particularly in the commute from his 79th Street home to his office at City Hall. An August 2007 story in The New York Times stated that he was often seen chauffeured by two New York Police Department-owned SUVs to an express train station to avoid having to change from the local to the express trains on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.[323] He supported the construction of the 7 Subway Extension and the Second Avenue Subway; on December 20, 2013, Bloomberg took a ceremonial ride on a train to the new 34th Street station to celebrate a part of his legacy as mayor.[324][325] At the 2007 commencement exercises for Tufts University, Bloomberg delivered the commencement address.[326] He was awarded an honorary degree in Public Service from the university. Likewise, Bloomberg delivered the 2007 commencement address at Bard College, where he was also awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.[327] In February 2003, he received the \"Award for Distinguished Leadership in Global Capital Markets\" from the Yale School of Management.[328] Bloomberg was named the 39th most influential person in the world in the 2007 and 2008 Time 100.[329] In October 2010, Vanity Fair ranked him #7 in its \"Vanity Fair 100: The New Establishment 2010.\"[330] In May 2008, Bloomberg was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Pennsylvania, where he delivered the commencement speech to the class of 2008.[331] Bloomberg delivered the commencement address to the class of 2008 at Barnard College, located in New York City, after receiving the Barnard Medal of Distinction, the college's highest honor.[332] In 2009, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Fordham University.[333] In May 2011, Bloomberg was the speaker for Princeton University's 2011 baccalaureate service.[334] In June 2014, Bloomberg was the speaker for Williams College's 2014 commencement.[335] He received an honorary degree as doctor of laws.[336] Bloomberg was given a tribute award at the 2007 Gotham Awards, a New York City-based celebrator of independent film.[337] On November 19, 2008, Bloomberg received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York\".[338] Additionally, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at Fordham University's 2009 commencement ceremonies.[339] In 2009, Bloomberg received a Healthy Communities Leadership Award from Leadership for Healthy Communities \u2013 a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation national program \u2013 for his policies and programs that increase access to healthful foods and physical activity options in the city.[340] For instance, to increase access to grocery stores in underserved areas, the Bloomberg administration developed a program called FRESH that offers zoning and financial incentives to developers, grocery store operators and land owners.[341] His administration also created a Healthy Bodega initiative, which provides healthful food samples and promotional support to grocers in lower-income areas to encourage them to carry one-percent milk and fruits and vegetables.[342] Under Bloomberg's leadership, the city passed a Green Carts bill,[343] which supports mobile produce vendors in lower-income areas; expanded farmers' markets using the city's Health Bucks program, which provides coupons to eligible individuals to buy produce at farmers' markets in lower-income areas;[344] and committed $111 million in capital funding for playground improvements.[345] New York also was one of the first cities in the nation to help patrons make more informed decisions about their food choices by requiring fast-food and chain restaurants to label their menus with calorie information.[346] In 2010, Bloomberg received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards.[347] In 2013, Bloomberg was chosen as the inaugural laureate of the Genesis Prize, a $1-million award to be presented annually for Jewish values.[348] He will invest his US\u00a0$1M award in a global competition, the Genesis Generation Challenge, to identify young adults' big ideas to better the world.[349] In 2014, Bloomberg was bestowed the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Harvard University in recognition of his public service and leadership in the world of business.[350] On October 6, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II awarded Bloomberg as Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his \"prodigious entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavors, and the many ways in which they have benefited the United Kingdom and the U.K.-U.S. special relationship.\" As Bloomberg is not a citizen of the United Kingdom, he cannot use the title \"Sir\", but may, at his own discretion, use the post-nominal letters \"KBE\".[351] In 2015, the Bloomberg Terminal was featured prominently in the \"Tools of the Trade\" financial technology exhibit in Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum, as well as the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.[27] In March 2017, Bloomberg was ranked sixth on the UK-based company Richtopia's list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs.[352][353] In May 2019, Bloomberg was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Washington University in St. Louis, where he delivered the commencement speech to the class of 2019, and announced he would fund a conference at Washington University in early 2020 that will focus on mitigating the effects of climate change.[354][355][356]",

Bloomberg was the mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013 and is currently a candidate in the Democratic Party primaries for the 2020 United States presidential election.\nBloomberg grew up in Medford, Massachusetts and attended Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School. He began his career at the securities brokerage Salomon Brothers, before forming his own company in 1981, Bloomberg L.P., a global financial services, software and mass media company that bears his name, and is known for its Bloomberg Terminal, a computer software system providing financial data widely used in the global financial services industry. He spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. As of November 2019, this made him the ninth-richest person in the United States and the 14th-richest person in the world; his net worth was estimated at $58 billion.[3] Since signing The Giving Pledge whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth, Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.[4] He has given more than $3.3 billion to Johns Hopkins University, including his $1.8 billion gift in 2018 for student financial aid which was the largest private donation in modern times to higher education.[5]\nBloomberg served as the 108th mayor of New York City, holding office for three consecutive terms, two terms as a Republican and one as an Independent beginning his first in 2002. A lifelong Democrat before seeking elective office, Bloomberg switched his party registration in 2001 to run for mayor as a Republican. He defeated opponent Mark J. Green in a close election held just weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks. He won a second term in 2005 and left the Republican Party two years later. Bloomberg campaigned to change the city's term limits law and was elected to his third term in 2009 as an independent on the Republican ballot line. His final term as mayor ended on December 31, 2013. Bloomberg also served as chair of the board of trustees at his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, from 1996 to 2002. After a brief stint as a full-time philanthropist, Bloomberg re-assumed the position of CEO at Bloomberg L.P. by the end of 2014.\nBloomberg officially launched his campaign for the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2020 presidential election on November 24, 2019, following weeks of speculation that he would join the race as a late entry.[6]\nBloomberg was born at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, in Brighton, a neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, on February 14, 1942, to William Henry Bloomberg (1906\u20131963), a bookkeeper for a dairy company,[7] and Charlotte (Rubens) Bloomberg (1909\u20132011).[8][9] The Bloomberg Center at the Harvard Business School was named in William Henry's honor.[10] His family is Jewish. He is a member of the Emanu-El Temple in Manhattan.[11] Bloomberg's paternal grandfather, Alexander \"Elick\" Bloomberg, was an immigrant from Russia.[2] Bloomberg's maternal grandfather, Max Rubens, was an immigrant from what is present-day Belarus.[12][13]\nThe family lived in Allston until Bloomberg was two years old, when they moved to Brookline, Massachusetts, for the next two years, finally settling in the Boston suburb of Medford, Massachusetts, where he lived until after he graduated from college.[14]\nBloomberg is an Eagle Scout.[15][16]\nBloomberg attended Johns Hopkins University, where he joined the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. In 1962, as a sophomore, he constructed the school mascot's (the blue jay's) costume.[17] He graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. In 1966, he graduated from Harvard Business School with a Master of Business Administration.[18][19]\nIn 1973, Bloomberg became a general partner at Salomon Brothers, a large Wall Street investment bank, where he headed equity trading and, later, systems development. In 1981, Salomon Brothers was bought[20] by Phibro Corporation, and Bloomberg was laid off from the investment bank.[21] He was given no severance package, but owned $10 million worth of equity as a partner at the firm.[22]\nUsing this money, Bloomberg, having designed in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon, went on to set up a company named Innovative Market Systems (IMS). His business plan was based on the realization that Wall Street (and the financial community generally) was willing to pay for high-quality business information, delivered as quickly as possible and in as many usable forms possible, via technology (e.g., graphs of highly specific trends).[23]\nBloomberg, along with Thomas Secunda, Duncan MacMillan, and Charles Zegar, developed and built a computerized system to provide real-time market data, financial calculations and other financial analytics to Wall Street firms. The machines were first called \"Market Master Terminals\" and later on became known as \"Bloomberg Terminals.\" In 1983, Merrill Lynch became the company's first customer, investing $30 million in IMS to help finance the development of \"the Bloomberg\" terminal computer system and by 1984, IMS was selling machines to all of Merrill Lynch's clients.\nThe company was renamed Bloomberg L.P. in 1987.[24] By 1990, it had installed 8,000 terminals.[25] Over the years, ancillary products including Bloomberg News, Bloomberg Message, and Bloomberg Tradebook were launched.[26]\nAs of October 2015, the company had more than 325,000 terminal subscribers worldwide.[27] Subscriptions cost $24,000 per year, discounted to $20,000 for two or more.[28] As of 2019, Bloomberg employs 20,000 people in dozens of locations.[28] The company earned approximately $10 billion in 2018, loosely $3 billion more than Thomson Reuters, now Refinitiv, its nearest competitor.[28]\nHis company also has a radio network that currently has 1130 WBBR AM in New York City as its flagship station.\nWhen he left the position of CEO to pursue a political career as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg was replaced as CEO by Lex Fenwick.[29] During Bloomberg's three mayoral terms, the company was led by president Daniel L. Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor under Bloomberg.[30] After completing his final term as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg spent his first eight months out of office as a full-time philanthropist. In fall 2014, he announced that he would return to Bloomberg L.P. as CEO at the end of 2014,[31] succeeding Doctoroff, who had led the company since retiring from the Bloomberg administration in February 2008.[31][32][33]\nBloomberg still owns the business but resigned as CEO of Bloomberg L.P. to run for President in 2019.[28] Bloomberg is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[34] He wrote an autobiography, with help from Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler, called Bloomberg by Bloomberg.[35]\nIn March 2009, Forbes reported Bloomberg's wealth at $16 billion, a gain of $4.5 billion over the previous year, the world's biggest increase in wealth in 2009.[36] At that time, there were only four fortunes in the U.S. that were larger (although the Walmart family fortune is split among four people). He had moved from 142nd to 17th in the Forbes list of the world's billionaires in only two years.[37][38] Subsequently, Forbes reported his wealth at $22 billion, then $31 billion, then $43.3 billion, and ranked him 11th-, then 10th-, then 6th-richest in the U.S.[24][39][40] As of November 2019, Bloomberg was the 14th richest person in the world, with a net worth estimated at $58 billion.[3]\nBloomberg assumed office as the 108th Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2002. He won re-election in 2005 and again in 2009. As mayor, Bloomberg initially struggled with a low approval rating from the public; however, he subsequently developed and maintained high approval ratings.[41] His re-election meant the Republicans had won the previous four mayoral elections (although Bloomberg's decision to leave the Republican Party and be declared an independent on June 19, 2007, resulted in the Republican Party's losing the mayor's seat prior to the expiration of his second term). Bloomberg joined Rudy Giuliani and Fiorello La Guardia as re-elected Republican mayors in the mostly Democratic city.\nBloomberg stated that he wanted public education reform to be the legacy of his first term and addressing poverty to be the legacy of his second.[42] According to the National Assessment of Educational Performance, fourth-grade reading scores from 2002 to 2009 rose nationally by 11 points, but in May 2010, The New York Times reported that eighth-graders had shown no significant improvement in math or reading.\nBloomberg chose to apply a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what New York Times political reporter Adam Nagourney called a \"bullpen\" open office plan, similar to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.[43]\nIn efforts to create \"cutbacks\" in the New York City Spending Bracket, Bloomberg declined to receive a city salary. He accepted a remuneration of $1 annually for his services.[44]\nIn 2001, the incumbent mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, was ineligible for re-election, as the city limited the mayoralty to two consecutive terms. Several well-known New York City politicians aspired to succeed him. Bloomberg, a lifelong member of the Democratic Party, decided to run for mayor as a member of the Republican Party ticket. Voting in the primary began on the morning of September 11, 2001. The primary was postponed later that day, due to the September 11 attacks. In the rescheduled primary, Bloomberg defeated Herman Badillo, a former Democratic congressman, to become the Republican nominee. Meanwhile, the Democratic primary did not produce a first-round winner. After a runoff, the Democratic nomination went to New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green.\nIn the general election, Bloomberg received Giuliani's endorsement. He also had a huge spending advantage. Although New York City's campaign finance law restricts the amount of contributions that a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions. He spent $73 million of his own money on his campaign, outspending Green five to one.[45] One of the major themes of his campaign was that, with the city's economy suffering from the effects of the World Trade Center attacks, it needed a mayor with business experience.\nIn addition to serving as the Republican nominee, Bloomberg had the ballot line of the controversial Independence Party, in which \"Social Therapy\" leaders Fred Newman and Lenora Fulani exert strong influence. Some[who?] say that endorsement was important, as Bloomberg's votes on that line exceeded his margin of victory over Green. (Under New York's fusion rules, a candidate can run on more than one party's line and combine all the votes received on all lines. Green, the Democrat, had the ballot line of the Working Families Party). Bloomberg also created an independent line called Students First whose votes were combined with those on the Independence line. Another factor was the vote in Staten Island, which has traditionally been far friendlier to Republicans than the rest of the city. Bloomberg handily beat Green in that borough, taking 75 percent of the vote. Overall, Bloomberg won 50 percent to 48 percent.[citation needed]\nBloomberg's election marked the first time in New York City history that two different Republicans had been elected mayor consecutively. New York City has not been won by a Republican in a presidential election year since Calvin Coolidge won in 1924. Bloomberg is considered a social liberal, who is pro-choice, in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and an advocate for stricter gun control laws.\nAlthough 68 percent of New York City's registered voters are Democrats, Bloomberg decided the city should host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The convention drew thousands of protesters, many of them local residents angry over the Iraq war and other issues. The New York Police Department arrested approximately 1,800 protesters, but according to The New York Times, more than 90 percent of the cases were later dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence.[46]\nBloomberg was re-elected mayor in November 2005 by a margin of 20 percent, the widest margin ever for a Republican mayor of New York City.[47] He spent almost $78 million on his campaign, exceeding the record of $74 million he spent on the previous election. In late 2004 or early 2005, Bloomberg gave the Independence Party of New York $250,000 to fund a phone bank seeking to recruit volunteers for his re-election campaign.[48]\nFormer Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer won the Democratic nomination to oppose Bloomberg in the general election. Thomas Ognibene sought to run against Bloomberg in the Republican Party's primary election.[49] The Bloomberg campaign successfully challenged enough of the signatures Ognibene had submitted to the Board of Elections to prevent Ognibene from appearing on ballots for the Republican primary.[49] Instead, Ognibene ran on only the Conservative Party ticket.[50] Ognibene accused Bloomberg of betraying Republican Party ideals, a feeling echoed by others.[51][52][53][54]\nBloomberg opposed the confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States.[55] Though a Republican at the time, Bloomberg is a staunch supporter of abortion rights and did not believe that Roberts was committed to maintaining Roe v. Wade.[55] In addition to Republican support, Bloomberg obtained the endorsements of several prominent Democrats: former Democratic Mayor Ed Koch; former Democratic governor Hugh Carey; former Democratic City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, and his son, Councilman Peter Vallone Jr.; former Democratic Congressman Floyd Flake (who had previously endorsed Bloomberg in 2001), and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz.[56]\nOn October 2, 2008, Bloomberg announced he would seek to extend the city's term limits law and run for a third mayoral term in 2009, arguing a leader of his field was needed following the financial crisis of 2007\u201308. \"Handling this financial crisis while strengthening essential services\u00a0... is a challenge I want to take on,\" Bloomberg said at a news conference. \"So should the City Council vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if I have earned another term.\"[57]\nRonald Lauder, who campaigned for New York City's term limits in 1993 and spent over 4 million dollars of his own money to limit the maximum years a mayor could serve to eight years,[58] sided with Bloomberg in running for a third term and agreed to stay out of future legality issues.[59] In exchange, he was promised a seat on an influential city board by Bloomberg.[60]\nSome people and organizations objected and NYPIRG filed a complaint with the City Conflict of Interest Board.[61] On October 23, 2008, the City Council voted 29\u201322 in favor of extending the term limit to three consecutive four-year terms, thus allowing Bloomberg to run for office again.[62] After two days of public hearings, Bloomberg signed the bill into law on November 3.[63]\nBloomberg's bid for a third term generated some controversy. Civil libertarians such as former New York Civil Liberties Union Director Norman Siegel and New York Civil Rights Coalition Executive Director Michael Meyers joined with local politicians such as New York State Senator Eric Adams to protest the term-limits extension.[64]\nBloomberg's opponent was Democratic and Working Families Party nominee Bill Thompson, who had been New York City Comptroller for the past eight years and before that, president of the New York City Board of Education.[65] Bloomberg defeated Thompson by a vote of 51% to 46%.[66]\nAfter the release of Independence Party campaign filings in January 2010, it was reported that Bloomberg had made two $600,000 contributions from his personal account to the Independence Party on October 30 and November 2, 2009.[67] The Independence Party then paid $750,000 of that money to Republican Party political operative John Haggerty Jr.[68]\nThis prompted an investigation beginning in February 2010 by the office of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. into possible improprieties.[69] The Independence Party later questioned how Haggerty spent the money, which was to go to poll-watchers.[70] Former New York State Senator Martin Connor contended that because the Bloomberg donations were made to an Independence Party housekeeping account rather than to an account meant for current campaigns, this was a violation of campaign finance laws.[71] Haggerty also spent money from a separate $200,000 donation from Bloomberg on office space.[72]\nOn March 5, 2019, Bloomberg had announced that he would not run for president in 2020; instead he encouraged the Democratic Party to \"nominate a Democrat who will be in the strongest position to defeat Donald Trump.\"[73] However, due to his dissatisfaction with the Democratic field, Bloomberg reconsidered. He officially launched his campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination on November 24, 2019.[74]\nBloomberg is financing his campaign personally and has said he won't accept donations.[75] As of December 31, 2019 - five weeks after declaring his candidacy - he had spent or committed $200 million, mostly on television advertising, producing \"an onslaught of campaign commercials with no precedent in Democratic politics\".[76] By mid January 2020 he was polling in the high single digits, ranking fourth among the Democratic candidates in one poll.[77][78]\nBloomberg has been a registered Democrat for most of his life. He is regarded as socially liberal or progressive on multiple issues, supporting abortion rights, same-sex marriage, strict gun control measures, environmentalism and a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. On economics and foreign policy issues, Bloomberg has tended towards a moderate stance. He opposed a timeline for withdrawal from the Iraq War, and criticized those who favored one. Economically, he supports government involvement in issues such as public welfare while being strongly in favor of free trade and being pro-business, describing himself as a fiscal conservative because he balanced New York City's budget.[79] He is concerned about climate change and has touted his mayoral efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.[80] Bloomberg has been criticized for not allowing many emergency officials who responded to the September 11, 2001, attacks to attend the tenth anniversary observation of that day.[81] He was also at odds with many around the U.S. for not inviting any clergy to the ceremony marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.[82]\nBloomberg supports abortion rights, stating, \"Reproductive choice is a fundamental human right and we can never take it for granted. On this issue, you're either with us or against us.\" He has criticized \"pro-choice\" politicians who support \"pro-life\" candidates.[83]\nBloomberg supports governmental funding for embryonic stem cell research, calling the Republican position on the issue \"insanity\".[84] He supports same-sex marriage with the rationale that \"government shouldn't tell you whom to marry.\"[85]\nBloomberg supports the strict drug laws of New York City. He has stated that he smoked marijuana in the past, and was quoted in a 2001 interview as saying \"You bet I did. I enjoyed it.\" This led to a reported $500,000 advertising campaign by NORML, featuring his image and the quote. Bloomberg stated in a 2002 interview that he regretted the remark and did not believe that marijuana should be decriminalized.[86] In 2012, Bloomberg backed an effort by Governor Andrew Cuomo to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana.[87] In January 2019, Bloomberg said \u201cLast year, in 2017, 72,000 Americans OD\u2019d [overdosed] on drugs. In 2018, more people than that are OD-ing on drugs, have OD\u2019d on drugs, and today, incidentally, we are trying to legalize another addictive narcotic, which is perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done.\"[88][89] In December 2019, Bloomberg came out in favor of marijuana decriminalization and allowing states to legalize it without federal intervention.[90]\nIn April 2006, along with Boston mayor Thomas Menino, Bloomberg co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns.[91][92] A December 2013 press release by the group said the bipartisan coalition included over 1,000 mayors.[91] In 2014, the organization merged with Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America to form Everytown for Gun Safety,[93] which in 2018 in collaboration with student groups organized the March For Our Lives.[94] When asked in an April 2014 interview why he was devoting so many of his personal resources to supporting gun control, restrictive food choice and smoking cessation, his concern was about his mortality, replying \"I am telling you if there is a God, when I get to heaven I\u2019m not stopping to be interviewed. I am heading straight in. I have earned my place in heaven. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d[95]\nAs mayor, Bloomberg increased the mandatory minimum sentence for illegal possession of a loaded handgun, saying, \"Illegal guns don't belong on our streets and we're sending that message loud and clear. We're determined to see that gun dealers who break the law are held accountable, and that criminals who carry illegal loaded guns serve serious time behind bars.\"[96] He opposes the death penalty, saying he would \"rather lock somebody up and throw away the key and put them in hard labor\".[96] He has called the death penalty \"murder by the state\".[97]\nBloomberg was a staunch proponent of stop-and-frisk in New York City and has argued that it lowered the murder rate.[98] The manner in which the NYPD utilized the practice was ruled unconstitutional in 2013, but the practice itself was not deemed unconstitutional.[99][100] There is no evidence that the practice reduced the crime rate.[101] However, in 2018 Bloomberg said of stop-and-frisk, \"The history of the decline in police stops is misunderstood. As crime hit historic lows, and more than a year before any court ruling, I pledged to a Sunday congregation in Brooklyn and to all New Yorkers that 'we must and will do better' by reforming police practices while continuing to drive down crime. And that's exactly what we did, on our own accord. We cut police stops by 94 percent, while continuing to reduce crime and incarceration.\"[102]\nOn November 17, 2019, while speaking in Brooklyn's non-denominational Christian Cultural Center, Bloomberg renounced his previous support for stop-and-frisk and issued an apology.[103][104] New York Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Bloomberg's apology by stating \"This is LONG overdue and the timing is transparent and cynical.\"[105] Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch also criticized Bloomberg's apology, noting in a statement that, \"We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities,\u201d and that the \"[Bloomberg] administration\u2019s misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe.\u201d[106]\nBloomberg replaced New York City's school board set up by the state of New York with a setup providing direct mayoral control over public education.[107][108] This was criticized by some, such as former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch who has argued that mayoral control led to further privatization of education.[109] Bloomberg states that he raised the salaries of teachers by fifteen percent while boosting test scores and graduation rates.[110][111] Some, such as the United Federation of Teachers, dispute these claims, criticizing Bloomberg for including things that do not show up on a paycheck, such as increased spending on teachers' pensions and healthcare, which they say inflate the amount teachers' salaries were raised; they also accuse him of exaggerating the boost in graduation rates and the role his administration played in it, pointing out that New York City's graduation rates still far lagged behind the rest of New York State.[112][113][114]\nBloomberg opposes social promotion, stating that students should be promoted only when they are adequately prepared for the next grade level. Some educators disagree, however, arguing that leaving children behind stigmatizes them as failures, only to face failure again as they repeat the grade.[115] He favors after-school programs to help students who are behind. As mayor, Bloomberg strengthened the cellphone ban in schools.[116] In Los Angeles, Bloomberg waded into the controversy over the proliferation of charter schools, donating over $1 million to elect pro-charter school board candidates opposed by United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA).[117]\nDuring his second term as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg unveiled PlaNYC: A Greener, Greater New York on April 22, 2007, to fight global warming, protect the environment and prepare for the projected 1 million additional people expected to be living in the city by the year 2030.[118]\nUnder PlaNYC, in just six years New York City reduced citywide greenhouse gas emissions by 19% since 2005 and was on track to achieve a 30% reduction ahead of the PlaNYC 2030 goal.[119] In October 2007, as part of PlaNYC, Bloomberg launched the Million Trees NYC initiative, which aimed to plant and care for one million trees throughout the city in the next decade. In November 2015, New York City planted its one millionth tree, two years ahead of the original 10-year schedule.[120]\nIn 2008, Bloomberg convened the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), an effort to prepare the city for climate change.[121] In 2012, Travel + Leisure readers voted New York City the \"Dirtiest American City,\" for having the most extant litter.[122] Bloomberg has been involved in motivating other cities to make changes and has spoken about reducing carbon dioxide emissions, using cleaner and more efficient fuels, using congestion pricing in New York City, and encouraging public transportation.[123]\nBloomberg unveiled the Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency (SIRR) in June 2013, after the city was affected by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The $20 billion initiative laid out extensive plans to protect New York City against future impacts of climate change.[124] On September 26, 2013, Bloomberg announced that his administration's air pollution reduction efforts had resulted in the best air quality in New York City in more than 50 years.[125] The majority of the air quality improvement was attributed to the phasing out of heavy polluting heating oils through New York's \"Clean Heat\" program.[126] As a result of the improved air quality, the average life expectancy of New Yorkers had increased three years during Bloomberg's tenure, compared to 1.8 years in the rest of the country.[127]\nBy 2017 Bloomberg donated 100 million dollars to the campaign Beyond Coal, that helped close over half of the US coal power stations, since 2011 when it was expanded due to his financial help. In 2017 he donated 64 million dollars more, the day after EPA head Scott Pruitt began to abolish President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan.[128]\nIn 2019 Bloomberg, with the Sierra Club and other organizations, launched \"Beyond Carbon,\" an initiative to complete the USA's transition to non-fossil energy sources.[129]\nBloomberg and former California Governor Jerry Brown launched and are leading America's Pledge, a coalition of cities, businesses, states and more in the US to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[130][131] The organization covers 68% of the GDP and 65% of the population of the United States. In COP25 it presented a report named \"ACCELERATING AMERICA\u2019S PLEDGE,\" in which it stated that already existing commitments can cut USA greenhouse gas emissions by 19% by 2025 and by 25% by 2030. Accelerating local action can lower emissions by 37% by the year 2030, and if federal support will be adjusted, by 49% by the same year relative to the level of the year 2005.[132][133]\nSee further information in the section: \"Environmental Advocacy\" in this page.\nBloomberg has criticized those who advocate for mass deportation of illegal immigrants, calling their stance unrealistic, \"We're not going to deport 12 million people, so let's stop this fiction. Let's give them permanent status.\"[134] He supports a federal ID database that uses DNA and fingerprint technology to keep track of all citizens and to verify their legal status.[135] Bloomberg has held that illegal immigrants should be offered legalization and supported the congressional efforts of John McCain and Ted Kennedy in their attempt at immigration reform in 2007.[136]\nRegarding border security, he compared it to the tide, stating, \"It's as if we expect border control agents to do what a century of communism could not: defeat the natural market forces of supply and demand ... and defeat the natural human desire for freedom and opportunity. You might as well as sit in your beach chair and tell the tide not to come in. As long as America remains a nation dedicated to the proposition that 'all Men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness', people from near and far will continue to seek entry into our country.\"[137]\nIn 2006, Bloomberg stated on his weekly WABC radio show that illegal immigration does not strain the financial resources of New York City, since many immigrants are hard working and \"do not avail themselves of services until their situation is dire.\"[138][citation needed]\nIn January 2011, city schools began a pilot program which allows girls over 14 years old to be provided with Plan B emergency contraception without parental consent, unless parents opt out in writing. Beginning with five schools, the pilot had been expanded to thirteen schools by September 2012.[139][140]\nOn December 5, 2006, New York City under Bloomberg became the first city in the United States to ban trans fat from all restaurants. This went into effect in July 2008.[141]\nIn September 2012, the city passed a law limiting the practice of circumcision among Orthodox Jews. The legislation requires that at each event, the mohel receives signed consent forms from the parents, acknowledging that they were notified of health risks associated with cleaning the wound by sucking blood from the male baby's organ. This regulation caused an outcry among certain Orthodox Jewish communities on this alleged infringement of their religious freedom,[142][143] and the matter was taken to federal court.[144]\nDuring the same month, the NYC Board of Health approved Bloomberg's proposal to ban the sale of many sweetened drinks more than 16 ounces (473ml) in volume. The limit would have applied to businesses such as restaurants and movie theaters, but did not apply to grocery stores, including 7-Eleven. Diet varieties of sweetened drinks were unaffected.[145]\nOn March 12, 2013, hours before the ban was scheduled to take effect, State Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling struck it down, ruling that the Board of Health lacked the jurisdiction to enforce it and that the rule was \"arbitrary and capricious\". The city appealed the decision.[146] On July 30, the Appellate Division upheld the lower court's ruling, stating the Board of Health \"failed to act within the bounds of its lawfully delegated authority\" and the ban was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine, which reserves legislative power to the legislature and does not allow the board to \"exercise sweeping power to create whatever rule they deem necessary\". Bloomberg announced that the city would appeal the decision.[147]\nBloomberg has been criticized for some of his policies which have been described by many as facilitating the creation of a nanny state.[148] Comedian Bill Maher, while on Jimmy Kimmel Live, said that Bloomberg's soda ban \"gives liberals a bad name\".[149] In response to the soda ban, The Center for Consumer Freedom ran a full-page ad in The New York Times featuring an image of Bloomberg's face superimposed on an elderly female body wearing a dress and scarf, with the title \"The Nanny\", and the tagline \"New Yorkers Need a Mayor, Not a Nanny.\"[150] Others have pointed out that the smoking rate dropped quickly during Bloomberg's time in office (which has involved the banning of smoking in certain areas).[148]\nCriticism of Bloomberg's attempt to ban the sale of large soft drinks was picked up, mostly by Republican and libertarian commentators and politicians, as a line of attack in political campaigns around the United States. In one example, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul brought Big Gulps to a joint appearance for Cuccinelli's ultimately unsuccessful 2013 gubernatorial campaign to symbolize Bloomberg's efforts to restrict soft drink sales, criticizing the mayor for wanting \"to buy the governor's office down here\", a reference to pro-gun control advertisements his political action committee was running in the state.[151] Republican legislators in Wisconsin reacted to the ban by inserting language to prohibit communities from restricting the sale of large soft drinks throughout the state in a 2013 budget bill.[152]\nBloomberg believes that the September 11, 2001 attacks were not intended to be solitary events. When he assumed office, he set up a Counterterrorism Bureau which works along with the NYPD intelligence division to gather information about worldwide terrorism affecting New York City.[153] He believes that funding for Homeland Security by the federal government should be distributed by risk, where cities that are considered to have the highest threat for a terrorist attack would get the most money.[154] Bloomberg is also a supporter of the USA PATRIOT Act.[155]\nAfter the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombings, Bloomberg said that laws and the interpretation of the Constitution have to change to provide greater security against such attacks, \"the people who are worried about privacy have a legitimate worry, but we live in a complex world where you're going to have a level of security greater than you did back in the olden days, if you will\u00a0... our laws and our interpretation of the Constitution, I think, have to change.\"[156]\nBloomberg characterizes himself as a fiscal conservative for turning the city's $6-billion deficit into a $3-billion surplus; however, conservative PAC Club for Growth has criticized him because he increased property taxes and spending while doing so.\nBeing a fiscal conservative is not about slashing programs that help the poor, or improve health care, or ensure a social safety net. It's about insisting services are provided efficiently, get to only the people that need them, and achieve the desired results. Fiscal conservatives have hearts too\u00a0\u2013 but we also insist on using our brains, and that means demanding results and holding government accountable for producing them.\nTo me, fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets\u00a0\u2013 not running deficits that the next generation can't afford. It means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you don't squander it. And most importantly, being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns\u00a0\u2013 and by all indications, we've got one coming.\nBloomberg has expressed a distaste for taxes, stating, \"Taxes are not good things, but if you want services, somebody's got to pay for them, so they're a necessary evil.\"[157] As mayor, he did raise property taxes to fund budget projects; however, in January 2007, he proposed cuts in property taxes by five percent and cuts in sales taxes, including the elimination of taxes on clothing and footwear. Bloomberg pointed to the Wall Street profits and the real estate market as evidence that the city's economy is booming and could handle a tax break.[158]\nBloomberg's self-described fiscal conservatism also led him to eliminate the existing $6-billion deficit when he assumed office. Bloomberg balanced the budget of New York City by raising property taxes and making cuts to city agencies.[159]\nBloomberg is in favor of providing tax breaks to big corporations for the good of the whole community. As mayor, Bloomberg lobbied the CEO of Goldman Sachs to establish its headquarters across from Ground Zero by promising $1.65 billion in tax breaks. Regarding this deal, Bloomberg stated, \"This [New York City] is where the best want to live and work. So I told him [CEO of Goldman Sachs], 'We can help with minimizing taxes. Minimizing your rent. Improving security. But in the end, this is about people.'\"[160]\nBloomberg had less cordial relations with unions as mayor. In 2002, when New York City's transit workers threatened to strike, Bloomberg responded by riding a mountain bike through the city to show how the city could deal with the transit strike by finding alternate means of transportation and not pandering to the unions.[161] Three years later, a clash over wages and union benefits led to a three-day strike. Negotiations led to the end of the strike in December 2005.[162]\nBloomberg is a staunch advocate of free trade and is strongly opposed to protectionism, stating, \"The things that we have to worry about is this protectionist movement that has reared its head again in this country. ... \" He worries about the growth of China and fears the lessening gap between the United States and other countries, \"The rest of the world is catching up, and, there are people that say, surpassing us. I hope they are wrong. I hope those who think we are still in good shape are right. But nevertheless, the time to address these issues is right now.\"[163]\nBloomberg has placed a strong emphasis on public health and welfare, adopting many liberal policies. As the mayor he made HIV, diabetes, and hypertension all top priorities. He extended the city's smoking ban to all commercial establishments and implemented a trans fat ban in restaurants.[164] Bloomberg has been a strong supporter of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation\u00a0\u2013 the largest urban healthcare agency in the United States\u00a0\u2013 serving over 1.3 million New Yorkers, and has touted its use of information technology and Electronic Health Records to increase efficiency and enhance patient care.[165] He launched a program called Opportunity NYC, the nation's first-ever conditional cash transfer pilot program, designed to help New Yorkers break the cycle of poverty in the city. He instituted a $7.5-billion municipal affordable housing plan, the largest in the nation, that is supposed to provide 500,000 New Yorkers with housing.[166]\nBloomberg has expressed concern about poverty and growing class divisions, stating, \"This society cannot go forward, the way we have been going forward, where the gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing.\"[163]\nAs mayor, Bloomberg made trips to Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Israel in the first four months of 2007.[167] In late 2007 he conducted an Asia trip that brought him to China, where he called for greater freedom of information to promote innovation. He attended the United Nations Climate Conference in Bali.\nInitially, Bloomberg strongly supported the war in Iraq and the rationale for going in. He stated, \"Don't forget that the war started not very many blocks from here,\"[168] alluding to Ground Zero. In regard to the global War on Terrorism including Iraq he said, \"It's not only to protect Americans. It's America's responsibility to protect people around the world who want to be free.\" During the 2004 presidential election campaign, New York City hosted the Republican National Convention at which Bloomberg endorsed President George W. Bush for President of the United States.[169]\nHis enthusiasm seemed to have lessened somewhat over the course of the war. In August 2005, he said, \"I think everybody has very mixed emotions about the war that was started to find weapons of mass destruction and then they were not found.\"[170] Bloomberg expressed criticism of Democrats in Congress who wanted to set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, calling them \"irresponsible\".[171]\nIn September 2019, Bloomberg said that the Communist Party of China \"listens to the public\" on pollution and stated Xi Jinping is not a dictator because he has to \"satisfy his constituents, or he's not going to survive...\" Bloomberg argued governments, even non-democratic governments, are not able to operate without the will of the majority of their people, so he predicted China will take further action to combat climate change.[172] In January 2020, Bloomberg came out in favor of sanctions on Chinese officials for \"human rights violations in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang.\"[173]\nBloomberg is a proponent of large-scale development. He has repeatedly supported projects such as the Pacific Park mega-development, the Hudson Yards Redevelopment and associated rail-yard development (even supporting a subway extension to Hudson Yards), and the Harlem rezoning proposal.[174] On smaller-scale issues, Bloomberg usually takes the side of development as well. He favors the demolition of Admiral's Row[175] to build a supermarket parking lot. However, Bloomberg has occasionally sided with preservation, most notably in vetoing landmark revocation for the Austin Nichols warehouse.[176] This move was widely applauded by architectural historians. The City Council overruled the veto shortly thereafter, however.[177]\nOn September 13, 2013, Bloomberg announced that he would not endorse any of the candidates to succeed him.[178][179] On his radio show, he stated, \"I don't want to do anything that complicates it for the next mayor. And that's one of the reasons I've decided I'm just not going to make an endorsement in the race.\" He added, \"I want to make sure that person is ready to succeed, to take what we've done and build on that.\"[180]\nPrior to the announcement in an interview in New York magazine, Bloomberg praised The New York Times for its endorsement of Christine Quinn and Joe Lhota as their favorite, respective, candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries.[181][182] Quinn came in third in the Democratic primary and Lhota won the Republican primary.\nEarlier in the month, Bloomberg was chastised in the press for his remarks regarding Democratic mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio's campaign methods.[183] Bloomberg said initially in a New York magazine interview that he considered de Blasio's campaign \"racist,\" and when asked about his comment, Bloomberg explained what he meant by his remark.[184]\nWell, no, no, I mean he's making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone watching what he's been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It's comparable to me pointing out I'm Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about.[184]On January 1, 2014, de Blasio became New York City's new mayor, succeeding Bloomberg.[185]\nIn June 2018, Bloomberg made plans to give $80 million to support Democratic congressional candidates in the 2018 election, with the goal of flipping control of the Republican-controlled House to Democrats. In a statement, Bloomberg said that Republican House leadership were \"absolutely feckless\" and had failed to govern responsibly. Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson was chosen to lead the effort, which was to target mainly suburban districts.[186] By early October, Bloomberg had committed more than $100 million to returning the House and Senate to Democratic power, fueling speculation about a presidential run in 2020.[187] On October 10, 2018, Bloomberg announced that he had changed his political party affiliation to Democrat, which he had previously been registered as prior to 2001.[188]\nBloomberg was frequently mentioned as a possible centrist candidate for the presidential elections in 2008 and 2012, as well as for governor of New York in 2010. He declined to seek either office, opting to continue serving as the mayor of New York City.\nThere was widespread speculation that he would run as a third-party candidate in the 2016 presidential election, though he chose not to, later endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president. In October 2018, Bloomberg changed his political party affiliation back to the Democrats.[189]\nOn February 27, 2008, Bloomberg announced that he would not run for president in 2008, and that he would endorse a candidate who took an independent and non-partisan approach.[190] He had also stated unequivocally, live on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, on December 31, 2007, that he was not going to run for president in 2008.[191] Despite prior public statements by Bloomberg denying plans for a presidential run,[192] many pundits believed Bloomberg would announce a campaign at a later date. On January 7, 2008, he met at the University of Oklahoma with a bipartisan group, including (now former) Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, both of whom had been frequently mentioned as possible running mates, to pressure the major-party candidates to promote national unity and reduce partisan gridlock. Speculation that Bloomberg would choose this forum to announce his candidacy proved to be unfounded.[193][194]\nIn summer 2006, he met with Al From of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group, to talk about the logistics of a possible run.[195] After a conversation with Bloomberg, Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska suggested that he and Bloomberg could run on a shared independent ticket for the presidency.[196]\nOn This Week on June 10, 2007, anchor George Stephanopoulos included panelist Jay Carney, who mentioned a conversation between Bloomberg and top staffers where he heard Bloomberg ask approximately how much a presidential campaign would cost. Carney said that one staffer replied, \"Around $500 million.\" According to a Washington Post article, a $500-million budget would allow Bloomberg to circumvent many of the common obstacles faced by third-party presidential candidates.[197] On June 19, 2007, Bloomberg left the Republican Party, filing as an independent after a speech criticizing the current political climate in Washington.[198][199]\nOn August 9, 2007, in an interview with former CBS News anchor Dan Rather that aired on August 21, Bloomberg categorically stated that he was not running for president, that he would not be running, and that there were no circumstances in which he would, saying, \"If somebody asks me where I stand, I tell them. And that's not a way to get elected, generally. Nobody's going to elect me president of the United States. What I'd like to do is to be able to influence the dialogue. I'm a citizen.\"[200]\nDespite continued denials, a possible Bloomberg candidacy continued to be the subject of media attention, including a November Newsweek cover story.[201] During a private reception in December 2007, Bloomberg conducted a version of bingo in which guests were to guess the meaning of the numbers on a printed card. When Bloomberg asked the significance of 271, one guest answered correctly: the number of electoral votes received by George W. Bush in 2000.[202] In January 2008, CNN reported that a source close to Bloomberg said that the mayor had launched a research effort to assess his chances of winning a potential presidential bid. According to the report, the unidentified source also stated that Bloomberg had set early March as a timetable for making a decision as to whether or not to run.[203] On January 16, 2008, it was reported that Bloomberg's business interests were placed in \"a sort of blind trust\" because of his possible run for the presidency. His interests were put under the management of Quadrangle Group, co-founded by reported Bloomberg friend Steven Rattner, though Bloomberg would continue to control particular investment decisions.[204]\nIn January 2008, the Associated Press reported that Bloomberg met with Clay Mulford, a ballot-access expert and campaign manager for Ross Perot's third-party presidential campaigns. Bloomberg denied that the meeting concerned a possible presidential campaign, and said the following month, \"I am not \u2013 and will not be \u2013 a candidate for president.\" He added that he is \"hopeful that the current campaigns can rise to the challenge by offering truly independent leadership. The most productive role that I can serve is to push them forward, by using the means at my disposal to promote a real and honest debate.\"[190]\nAt the same time, there was also some speculation that Bloomberg could be a candidate for the vice presidency in 2008. In a blog posting of June 21, 2007, Ben Smith of The Politico asked the question of whether a vice-presidential candidate can self-finance an entire presidential ticket.[205]\nBloomberg did not publicly endorse a candidate for the 2008 U.S. presidential election, but it has since been revealed that he voted for Barack Obama.[206]\nIn November 2007, the New York Post detailed efforts by New York State Republicans to recruit Bloomberg to oppose Governor Eliot Spitzer in the 2010 election. Early polls indicated Bloomberg would defeat Spitzer in a landslide. (The potential 2010 match-up became moot when Spitzer resigned on March 17, 2008.)[207] A March 2008 poll of New York voters showed that, in a hypothetical 2010 gubernatorial matchup, Bloomberg would defeat Governor David Paterson (who became governor after Spitzer's resignation) and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the 2010 gubernatorial election.[208] Bloomberg did not run for governor.[209]\nIn March 2010, Bloomberg's top political strategist Kevin Sheekey resigned from his mayoral advisory position and returned to Bloomberg LP, Bloomberg's company. It was speculated that the move would allow Sheekey to begin preliminary efforts for a Bloomberg presidential campaign in the 2012 election. An individual close to Bloomberg said, \"the idea of continuing onward is not far from his [Bloomberg's] mind.\"[210]\nIn October 2010, the Committee to Draft Michael Bloomberg \u2013 which had attempted to recruit Bloomberg to run for the presidency in 2008 \u2013 announced it was relaunching its effort to persuade Bloomberg to wage a presidential campaign, in 2012.[211][212] The committee members insisted that they would persist in the effort in spite of Bloomberg's repeated denials of interest in seeking the presidency.[212][213]\nIn a December 2010 appearance on Meet the Press, Bloomberg ruled out a run for the presidency in 2012.[214] In July 2011, in the midst of Democrats' and Republicans' inability to agree on a budget plan and thus an increase in the federal debt limit, the Washington Post published a blog post about groups organizing third party approaches. It focused on Bloomberg as the best hope for a serious third-party presidential candidacy in 2012.[215]\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012, Bloomberg penned an op-ed officially endorsing Barack Obama for president, citing Obama's policies on climate change.[216][217]\nOn January 23, 2016, it was reported that Bloomberg was again considering a presidential run, as an independent candidate in the 2016 election.[218][219] This was the first time he had officially confirmed he was considering a run.[220] Bloomberg supporters believed that Bloomberg could run as a centrist and capture many voters who were dissatisfied with the likely Democratic and Republican nominees.[221] However, on March 7, Bloomberg announced he would not be running for president.[222][223]\nIn July 2016, Bloomberg delivered a speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in which he called Hillary Clinton \"the right choice\".[224][225][226] In the speech, Bloomberg warned of the dangers a Donald Trump presidency would pose. He said Trump \"wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He's wrong on both counts.\" Bloomberg also said Trump's economic plans \"would make it harder for small businesses to compete\" and would \"erode our influence in the world\". Trump responded to the speech by condemning Bloomberg in a series of tweets.[224][227]\nBloomberg is a dedicated environmentalist and has advocated policy to fight climate change at least since he became the mayor of New York City. At the national level, Bloomberg has consistently pushed for transitioning the United States' energy mix from fossil fuels to clean energy. In July 2011, Bloomberg donated $50 million through Bloomberg Philanthropies to Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, allowing the campaign to expand its efforts to shut down coal-fired power plants from 15 states to 45 states.[228][229] On April 8, 2015, to build on the success of the Beyond Coal campaign, Bloomberg announced an additional Bloomberg Philanthropies investment of $30 million in the Beyond Coal initiative, matched with another $30 million by other donors, to help secure the retirement of half of America's fleet of coal plants by 2017.[230]\nBloomberg's personal life was criticized by InsideSources for contradicting his environmentalist image. Bloomberg owns a $30 million private jet, a $4.5 million helicopter that burns 72 gallons of fuel per hour, and several low-mpg vehicles, including an SUV and sports car. Bloomberg owns about ten properties, including at least three mansions. He flies to his waterfront mansion in Bermuda several times per month.[231][232]\nBloomberg, through Bloomberg Philanthropies, awarded a $6 million grant to the Environmental Defense Fund in support of strict regulations on fracking, in the 14 states with the heaviest natural gas production.[233]\nIn October 2013, Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the Risky Business initiative with former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer. The joint effort worked to convince the business community of the need for more sustainable energy and development policies, by quantifying and publicizing the economic risks the United States faces from the impact of climate change.[234] In January 2015, Bloomberg led Bloomberg Philanthropies in a $48-million partnership with the Heising-Simons family to launch the Clean Energy Initiative. The initiative supports state-based solutions aimed at ensuring America has a clean, reliable, and affordable energy system.[235]\nSince 2010, Bloomberg has taken an increasingly global role on environmental issues. From 2010 to 2013, he served as the chairman of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a network of the world's biggest cities working together to reduce carbon emissions.[236] During his tenure, Bloomberg worked with President Bill Clinton to merge C40 with the Clinton Climate Initiative, with the goal of amplifying their efforts in the global fight against climate change worldwide.[237] He serves as the president of the board of C40 Cities.[238] In January 2014, Bloomberg began a five-year commitment totaling $53 million through Bloomberg Philanthropies to the Vibrant Oceans Initiative. The initiative partners Bloomberg Philanthropies with Oceana, Rare, and Encourage Capital to help reform fisheries and increase sustainable populations worldwide.[239] In 2018, Bloomberg joined Ray Dalio in announcing a commitment of $185 million towards protecting the oceans.[240]\nOn January 31, 2014, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed Bloomberg as his first Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change to help the United Nations work with cities to prevent climate change.[241] In September 2014, Bloomberg convened with Ban and global leaders at the UN Climate Summit to announce definite action to fight climate change in 2015.[242] Noting in March 2018 that \"climate change is running faster than we are,\" Ban's successor Ant\u00f3nio Guterres appointed Bloomberg as UN envoy for climate action.[243][244] He resigned on November 11, 2019, in the run-up to his presidential campaign.[245]\nIn late 2014, Bloomberg, Ban Ki-moon, and global city networks ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), with support from UN-Habitat, launched the Compact of Mayors, a global coalition of mayors and city officials pledging to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate change, and track their progress transparently.[246] To date, over 250 cities representing more than 300 million people worldwide and 4.1% of the total global population, have committed to the Compact of Mayors,[247] which was merged with the Covenant of Mayors in June 2016.[248][249]\nOn June 30, 2015, Bloomberg and mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo jointly announced the creation of the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, which convened on December 4, 2015.[250] The Climate Summit assembled hundreds of city leaders from around the world at Paris City Hall,[251][252] marking the largest recorded gathering of local leaders on the subject of fighting climate change.[253] The Summit concluded with the presentation of the Paris Declaration, a pledge by leaders from assembled global cities to cut carbon emissions by 3.7 gigatons annually by 2030.[254]\nDuring the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and chair of the Financial Stability Board, announced that Bloomberg will lead a new global task force designed to help industry and financial markets understand the growing risks of climate change.[255]\nBloomberg and former Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope co-authored a book on climate change, \"Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet,\"[256] published by St. Martin's Press.[257] The book was released 18 April 2017 and appeared on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction best seller list.[258]\nFollowing the announcement that the U.S. government would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, Bloomberg outlined a coalition of cities, states, universities and businesses that had come together to honor America's commitment under the agreement through 'America's Pledge.'[259] Through Bloomberg Philanthropies, he offered \"up to $15 million to support the U.N. agency that helps countries implement the agreement.\"[260][261]\nAbout a month later, Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown announced that the America's Pledge coalition would work to \"quantify the actions taken by U.S. states, cities and business to drive down greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\"[262][263] In announcing the initiative, Bloomberg said \"the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but American society remains committed to it.\"[264]\nTwo think-tanks, World Resource Institute and the Rocky Mountain Institute, will work with America's Pledge to analyze the work cities, states and businesses do to meet the U.S. commitment to the Paris agreement.[265]\nIn May 2019, Bloomberg announced a 2020 Midwestern Collegiate Climate Summit in Washington University in St. Louis with the aim to bring together leaders from Midwestern universities, local government and the private sector to reduce climate impacts in the region.[266][267]\nIn early June 2019, Bloomberg pledged $500 million to reduce climate impacts and shut remaining coal-fired power plants by 2030 via the new Beyond Carbon initiative.[268][269]\nOn August 25, 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies and Harvard University announced the creation of the joint Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative.[270] Funded by a $32 million gift from Bloomberg, the Initiative will host up to 300 mayors and 400 staff from around the world over the next four years in executive training programs focused on increasing effective public sector management and innovation at the city level.[271]\nBloomberg hosted the Global Business Forum on September 20, 2017. The event was held during the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly and featured international CEOs and heads of state.[272] The forum \"took place during the elite space once held by the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting,\" and former President Bill Clinton served as the first speaker.[273][274] The mission of the event was to discuss \"opportunities for advancing trade and economic growth, and the related societal challenges ...\"[274] In addition to Clinton and Bloomberg, speakers included Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, World Bank President Jim Kim, IMF head Christine Lagarde, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and French President Emmanuel Macron.[275][272]\nAccording to a profile of Bloomberg in Fast Company, his Bloomberg Philanthropies foundation has five areas of focus: public health, the arts, government innovation, the environment, and education.[276] According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Bloomberg was the third-largest philanthropic donor in America in 2015.[277] Through his Bloomberg Philanthropies Foundation, he has donated and/or pledged $240 million in 2005, $60 million in 2006, $47 million in 2007, $150 million in 2009, $332 million in 2010, $311 million in 2011, and $510M in 2015.[277][278]\n2011 recipients included the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; World Lung Foundation and the World Health Organization. In 2013 it was reported that Bloomberg had donated $109.24 million in 556 grants and 61 countries to campaigns against tobacco.[24] According to The New York Times, Bloomberg was an \"anonymous donor\" to the Carnegie Corporation from 2001 to 2010, with gifts ranging from $5 million to $20 million each year.[279] The Carnegie Corporation distributed these contributions to hundreds of New York City organizations ranging from the Dance Theatre of Harlem to Gilda's Club, a non-profit organization that provides support to people and families living with cancer. He continues to support the arts through his foundation.[280]\nIn 1996, Bloomberg endowed the William Henry Bloomberg Professorship at Harvard with a $3 million gift in honor of his father, who died in 1963, saying, \"throughout his life, he recognized the importance of reaching out to the nonprofit sector to help better the welfare of the entire community.\"[281] Bloomberg also endowed his hometown synagogue, Temple Shalom, which was renamed for his parents as the William and Charlotte Bloomberg Jewish Community Center of Medford.[282]\nBloomberg reports giving $254 million in 2009 to almost 1,400 nonprofit organizations, saying, \"I am a big believer in giving it all away and have always said that the best financial planning ends with bouncing the check to the undertaker.\"[283]\nIn July 2011, Bloomberg launched a $24 million initiative to fund \"Innovation Delivery Teams\" in five cities. The teams are one of Bloomberg Philanthropies' key goals: advancing government innovation.[284] In December 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched a partnership with online ticket search engine SeatGeek to connect artists with new audiences. Called the Discover New York Arts Project, the project includes organizations HERE, New York Theatre Workshop, and the Kaufman Center.[285] In his final term as mayor, Bloomberg earmarked a substantial appropriation to The Shed, a new arts center planned for Hudson Yards on the far west side of Manhattan.[286] He continued his support for The Shed after his time as mayor with a philanthropic donation of $75 million.[287] The Shed \"will present performances, concerts, visual art, music and other events.\"[288]\nOn March 22, 2012, Bloomberg announced his foundation was pledging $220 million over four years in the fight against global tobacco use.[289]\nBloomberg has donated $200 million toward the construction of new buildings at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In January 2013, Johns Hopkins University announced that with a recent $350 million gift, Bloomberg's total giving to his undergraduate alma mater surpassed $1.1 billion; his first gift to the school, 48 years prior, had been a $5 donation.[290] Five-sevenths of the $350 million gift is allocated to the Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships, endowing 50 Bloomberg Distinguished Professors (BDPs) whose interdisciplinary expertise crosses traditional academic disciplines.[291]\nIn June 2015, Bloomberg donated $100 million to Cornell Tech, the applied sciences graduate school of Cornell University, to construct the first academic building on the school's Roosevelt Island campus.  The building is named \"The Bloomberg Center.\"[292]\nIn September 2016, on the School of Public Health's centennial anniversary Bloomberg Philanthropies contributed $300 million to establish the Bloomberg American Health Initiative, bringing his total lifetime contribution to the university to $1.5 billion.[293]\nOn March 29, 2016, Bloomberg joined Vice President Joe Biden at Johns Hopkins University to announce the creation of The Bloomberg\u2013Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in East Baltimore.[294][295] The institute was launched with a $50 million gift by Bloomberg, a $50 million gift by philanthropist Sidney Kimmel, and $25 million from other donors.[296] It will support cancer therapy research, technology and infrastructure development, and private sector partnerships.[297] The institute embraces the spirit of Vice President Biden's \"cancer moonshot\" initiative, which seeks to find a cure for cancer through national coordination of government and private sector resources.[294]\nHe is the founder of Everytown for Gun Safety (formerly Mayors Against Illegal Guns), a gun control advocacy group. On August 17, 2016, the World Health Organization appointed Bloomberg as its Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases.[298] In this role, Bloomberg will mobilize private sector and political leaders to help the WHO reduce deaths from preventable diseases, traffic accidents, tobacco, obesity, and alcohol. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan cited Bloomberg's ongoing support for WHO anti-smoking, drowning prevention, and road safety programs in her announcement of his new role.[299][300]\nIn a ceremony on October 18, 2016, the Museum of Science, Boston announced a $50 million gift from Bloomberg.[301] The donation marks Bloomberg's fourth gift to the museum, which he credits with sparking his intellectual curiosity as a patron and student during his youth in Medford, Massachusetts.[302] The endowment will support and rename the museum's education division as the William and Charlotte Bloomberg Science Education Center, in honor of Bloomberg's parents. It is the largest donation in the museum's 186-year history.[303]\nOn December 5, 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies became the largest funder of tobacco-control efforts in the developing world. The group announced a $360 million commitment on top of their pre-existing commitment, bringing his total contribution close to $1 billion. This new donation will help expand its previous work, such as having monitor tobacco use, introduce strong tobacco-control laws, and create mass media campaigns to educate the public about the dangers of tobacco use. The program includes 110 countries, among them China, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.[304]\nOn November 18, 2018, Johns Hopkins announced a further gift of $1.8 billion from Bloomberg, marking the largest private donation in modern history to an institution of higher education and bringing Bloomberg's total contribution to the school in excess of $3.3 billion. Bloomberg's gift allows the school to practice need-blind admission and meet the full financial need of admitted students.[5]\nBloomberg will spend $10 million on advertisements defending Democratic congresspersons who expect to suffer reelection difficulties for having voted for the impeachment of Donald Trump.[305]\nIn 1975, Bloomberg married Susan Elizabeth Barbara Brown, a British national from Yorkshire, United Kingdom.[306] They had two daughters: Emma (born c. 1979) and Georgina (born 1983), who were featured on Born Rich, a documentary film about the children of the extremely wealthy. Bloomberg divorced Brown in 1993, but he has said she remains his \"best friend.\"[24] Since 2000, Bloomberg has lived with former New York state banking superintendent Diana Taylor.[307][308][309]\nMichael Bloomberg and his daughters own houses in Bermuda and stay there frequently.[310][311] His daughter Emma is married to Christopher Frissora, son of multimillionaire businessman Mark Frissora.[312]\nAlthough he attended Hebrew school, had a Bar Mitzvah, and his family kept a kosher kitchen, Bloomberg today is relatively secular, attending synagogue mainly during the High Holidays.[313] Neither of his daughters were raised Jewish.[313]\nLicensed as a private pilot,[314] Bloomberg pilots an AW109 helicopter, and as of 2012 was near the top of the waiting list for an AW609 tiltrotor aircraft.[315] In his youth he was a licensed amateur radio operator, was proficient in Morse code, and built ham radios.[316]\nHis younger sister, Marjorie Tiven, has been Commissioner of the New York City Commission for the United Nations, Consular Corps and Protocol, since February 2002.[317]\nIn 2013, he owned 13 properties in various countries around the world, including a mansion built in the Georgian style.[318][319] His newest acquisition is a historical property located in London that once belonged to writer George Eliot.[320]\nHe maintains a public listing in the New York City phone directory,[321] and during his term as mayor, he lived not in Gracie Mansion \u2013 the official mayoral residence \u2013 but instead at his own home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In addition to his Bermuda home, he has homes in London, and Vail, Colorado.[322]\nBloomberg stated that during his mayoralty, he rode the New York City Subway on a daily basis, particularly in the commute from his 79th Street home to his office at City Hall. An August 2007 story in The New York Times stated that he was often seen chauffeured by two New York Police Department-owned SUVs to an express train station to avoid having to change from the local to the express trains on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.[323] He supported the construction of the 7 Subway Extension and the Second Avenue Subway; on December 20, 2013, Bloomberg took a ceremonial ride on a train to the new 34th Street station to celebrate a part of his legacy as mayor.[324][325]\nAt the 2007 commencement exercises for Tufts University, Bloomberg delivered the commencement address.[326] He was awarded an honorary degree in Public Service from the university. Likewise, Bloomberg delivered the 2007 commencement address at Bard College, where he was also awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.[327] In February 2003, he received the \"Award for Distinguished Leadership in Global Capital Markets\" from the Yale School of Management.[328] Bloomberg was named the 39th most influential person in the world in the 2007 and 2008 Time 100.[329] In October 2010, Vanity Fair ranked him #7 in its \"Vanity Fair 100: The New Establishment 2010.\"[330]\nIn May 2008, Bloomberg was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Pennsylvania, where he delivered the commencement speech to the class of 2008.[331] Bloomberg delivered the commencement address to the class of 2008 at Barnard College, located in New York City, after receiving the Barnard Medal of Distinction, the college's highest honor.[332]\nIn 2009, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Fordham University.[333]\nIn May 2011, Bloomberg was the speaker for Princeton University's 2011 baccalaureate service.[334]\nIn June 2014, Bloomberg was the speaker for Williams College's 2014 commencement.[335] He received an honorary degree as doctor of laws.[336] Bloomberg was given a tribute award at the 2007 Gotham Awards, a New York City-based celebrator of independent film.[337] On November 19, 2008, Bloomberg received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York\".[338] Additionally, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at Fordham University's 2009 commencement ceremonies.[339]\nIn 2009, Bloomberg received a Healthy Communities Leadership Award from Leadership for Healthy Communities \u2013 a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation national program \u2013 for his policies and programs that increase access to healthful foods and physical activity options in the city.[340] For instance, to increase access to grocery stores in underserved areas, the Bloomberg administration developed a program called FRESH that offers zoning and financial incentives to developers, grocery store operators and land owners.[341] His administration also created a Healthy Bodega initiative, which provides healthful food samples and promotional support to grocers in lower-income areas to encourage them to carry one-percent milk and fruits and vegetables.[342] Under Bloomberg's leadership, the city passed a Green Carts bill,[343] which supports mobile produce vendors in lower-income areas; expanded farmers' markets using the city's Health Bucks program, which provides coupons to eligible individuals to buy produce at farmers' markets in lower-income areas;[344] and committed $111 million in capital funding for playground improvements.[345] New York also was one of the first cities in the nation to help patrons make more informed decisions about their food choices by requiring fast-food and chain restaurants to label their menus with calorie information.[346]\nIn 2010, Bloomberg received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards.[347]\nIn 2013, Bloomberg was chosen as the inaugural laureate of the Genesis Prize, a $1-million award to be presented annually for Jewish values.[348] He will invest his US\u00a0$1M award in a global competition, the Genesis Generation Challenge, to identify young adults' big ideas to better the world.[349]\nIn 2014, Bloomberg was bestowed the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Harvard University in recognition of his public service and leadership in the world of business.[350]\nOn October 6, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II awarded Bloomberg as Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his \"prodigious entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavors, and the many ways in which they have benefited the United Kingdom and the U.K.-U.S. special relationship.\" As Bloomberg is not a citizen of the United Kingdom, he cannot use the title \"Sir\", but may, at his own discretion, use the post-nominal letters \"KBE\".[351]\nIn 2015, the Bloomberg Terminal was featured prominently in the \"Tools of the Trade\" financial technology exhibit in Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum, as well as the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.[27]\nIn March 2017, Bloomberg was ranked sixth on the UK-based company Richtopia's list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs.[352][353]\nIn May 2019, Bloomberg was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Washington University in St. Louis, where he delivered the commencement speech to the class of 2019, and announced he would fund a conference at Washington University in early 2020 that will focus on mitigating the effects of climate change.[354][355][356]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nElizabeth Anne Holmes (/ho\u028amz/; born February 3, 1984)[2] is an American businesswoman who is the founder and former CEO of Theranos, a now-defunct healthcare company that soared in valuation because it claimed to have revolutionized blood testing using surprisingly small volumes of blood, such as from a fingerprick.[3][4] By 2015, Forbes named Holmes the youngest and wealthiest self-made female billionaire in America on the basis of a $9 billion valuation of her company.[5] Yet within a year, following revelations of potential fraud about its claims, Forbes revised her net worth to zero dollars,[6] and Fortune named Holmes one of the \"World's Most Disappointing Leaders\".[7] The decline of Theranos began in 2015, when a series of journalistic and regulatory investigations revealed doubts about the company's technology claims and whether Holmes had misled investors and the government. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Theranos and Holmes with deceiving investors by \"massive fraud\" through false or exaggerated claims about the accuracy of her blood-testing technology; Holmes settled the charges by paying a $500,000 fine, returning shares to the company, relinquishing her voting control of Theranos, and being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years. In June 2018, a federal grand jury indicted Holmes and former Theranos chief operating officer Ramesh Balwani on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for distributing blood tests with falsified results to consumers.[8][9] A trial is set to begin in August 2020. [10][11][12] The credibility of Theranos was in part interpreted as an effect of Holmes's personal connections and ability to recruit the support of influential people including Henry Kissinger, Hillary Clinton, George Shultz, James Mattis, and Betsy DeVos. Holmes was in a relationship with her chief operating officer Ramesh Balwani, and after the demise of Theranos she married hotel heir Billy Evans.[13] Holmes's career, the rise and dissolution of her company, and the subsequent fallout are the subject of a book, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, by the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, and an HBO documentary feature film, The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley. Holmes was born in Washington, D.C.[14] Her father, Christian Rasmus Holmes IV, was a vice president at Enron, after which he held executive positions in government agencies such as USAID, the EPA, and USTDA.[15][16][17] Her mother, Noel Anne (Daoust), worked as a Congressional committee staffer.[18] Holmes attended St. John's School in Houston.[14] During high school, she was interested in computer programming and claims she started her first business selling C++ compilers to Chinese universities.[19] Her parents had arranged Mandarin Chinese home tutoring, and partway through high school, Holmes began attending Stanford University's summer Mandarin program.[20] In 2001, Holmes attended Stanford, where she studied chemical engineering, and worked as a student researcher and laboratory assistant in the School of Engineering.[18] After the end of her freshman year, Holmes worked in a laboratory at the Genome Institute of Singapore testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome through the collection of blood samples with syringes.[19] She filed her first patent application on a wearable drug-delivery patch in 2003.[21][22] In March 2004, she dropped out of Stanford's School of Engineering and used her tuition money as seed funding for a consumer healthcare technology company.[18][23] Holmes founded the company Real-Time Cures in Palo Alto, California, to \"democratize healthcare\".[19][24][25][26] She sought to perform blood tests using only small amounts of blood. Holmes described her fear of needles as a motivation.[17][25] When Holmes initially pitched the idea to reap \"vast amounts of data from a few droplets of blood derived from the tip of a finger\" to her medicine professor Phyllis Gardner at Stanford, Gardner responded, \"I don't think your idea is going to work\", explaining it was impossible to do what Holmes was claiming could be done. Several other expert medical professors told Holmes the same thing.[17] However, Holmes did not relent, and succeeded in getting her advisor and dean at the School of Engineering, Channing Robertson, to back her idea.[17] In April 2004, Holmes incorporated the company as Theranos (a portmanteau of \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\")[27] and rented the basement of a group college house.[18] At that time, Holmes hired her first employee and rented lab space.[28] Robertson became the company's first board member and introduced Holmes to venture capitalists.[18] Holmes was an admirer of Apple founder Steve Jobs, and deliberately copied his style, frequently dressing in a black turtleneck sweater, as Jobs did.[29] During most of her public appearances, she spoke in an unusually deep baritone voice, although a former Theranos colleague later claimed that her natural voice was actually a few octaves higher.[20] Her family, meanwhile, has maintained that her baritone voice is authentic.[30] Theranos experienced a spectacular rise before its ultimate downfall. By December 2004, Holmes had raised $6 million to fund the firm.[18][28] By the end of 2010, Theranos had more than $92 million in venture capital.[21] In July 2011, Holmes was introduced to former secretary of state George Shultz. After a two-hour meeting, he joined the Theranos board of directors.[31] Holmes was recognized for forming \"the most illustrious board in U.S. corporate history\" over the next three years.[32] Holmes operated Theranos in \"stealth mode\" without press releases or a company website until September 2013, when the company announced a partnership with Walgreens to launch in-store blood sample collection centers.[33][34] Media attention increased in 2014, when Holmes appeared on the covers of Fortune, Forbes, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and Inc.[35] Forbes recognized Holmes as the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and ranked her #110 on the Forbes 400 in 2014. Theranos was valued at $9 billion with more than $400 million in venture capital.[18][36] By the end of 2014, her name appeared on 18 U.S. patents and 66 foreign patents.[22] During 2015, Holmes established agreements with Cleveland Clinic, Capital BlueCross, and AmeriHealth Caritas to use Theranos technology.[21] John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal initiated a secret, months-long investigation of Theranos after he received a tip from a medical expert who thought the blood testing device seemed suspicious.[20] Carreyrou spoke to ex-employee whistleblowers and obtained company documents. On learning of the investigation, Holmes initiated through her lawyer David Boies a campaign to stop Carreyrou from publishing, by levying legal and financial threats against the Journal and the whistleblowers.[20] In October 2015, despite Boies' legal threats and strong-arm tactics, Carreyrou published a \"bombshell article\"[37] that the Edison blood testing device by Theranos gave inaccurate results, and that the company used commercially available machines for most testing, as well as other incriminating details.[38] This was the first serious criticism of Theranos in the press, and a further series of articles by Carreyrou followed with more damning details. Holmes denied all the claims, calling the newspaper a \"tabloid\" and promising the company would publish data on the accuracy of its tests.[39][40] She appeared on Jim Cramer's Mad Money the same evening the article was published. Cramer said, \"The article was pretty brutal\", to which Holmes responded, \"This is what happens when you work to change things, first they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world.\"[41] In January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sent a warning letter to Theranos after an inspection of its Newark, California laboratory uncovered irregularities with staff proficiency, procedures, and equipment.[42] CMS regulators proposed a two-year ban on Holmes from owning or operating a lab after the company had not fixed problems in its California lab in March 2016.[43] On The Today Show, Holmes said she was \"devastated we did not catch and fix these issues faster\" and the lab would be rebuilt with help from a new scientific and medical advisory board.[44] In July 2016, CMS banned Holmes from owning, operating, or directing a blood-testing service for a period of two years. The company appealed that decision to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services appeals board.[17][45] Shortly thereafter, Walgreens ended its relationship with Theranos and closed its in-store blood collection centers. The FDA also ordered the company to cease using its Capillary Tube Nanotainer device, one of its core inventions.[46] In 2017, the State of Arizona filed suit against Theranos, alleging that the company had sold 1.5 million blood tests to Arizonans while concealing or misrepresenting important facts about those tests. The company settled the lawsuit in April of that year by agreeing to refund the cost of the tests to Arizona consumers, and to pay $225,000 in civil fines and attorney fees, for a total of $4.65 million.[47] Other reported ongoing actions include civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, an unspecified FBI investigation, and two class action fraud lawsuits. Holmes denied any wrongdoing.[17] On May 16, 2017, approximately 99 percent of Theranos shareholders reached an agreement with the company to dismiss all current and potential litigation in exchange for shares of preferred stock. Holmes released a portion of her equity to offset any dilution of stock value to non-participating shareholders.[48][49] On March 14, 2018, Holmes settled an SEC lawsuit.[50] The charges of fraud included the company's false claim that its technology was being used by the U.S. Department of Defense in combat situations.[51] The company also lied when it claimed to have a $100 million revenue stream in 2014. That year, the company only made $100,000.[52] The terms of Holmes' settlement included surrendering voting control of Theranos, a ban on holding an officer position in a public company for 10 years, and a $500,000 fine.[53][54][55] At its height, Theranos had more than 800 employees.[56] It fired 340 staff members in October 2016 and an additional 155 employees in January 2017.[57] In April 2018, Theranos filed a WARN Act notice with the State of California announcing its plans to permanently lay off 105 employees, leaving it with fewer than two dozen employees.[56][58] Most of the remaining employees were laid off in August 2018. On September 5, 2018, the company announced that it has begun the process of formally dissolving, with its remaining cash and assets to be distributed to its creditors.[59] On June 15, 2018, following an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco that lasted more than two years, a federal grand jury indicted Holmes and former Theranos chief operating officer and president Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that Holmes and Balwani engaged in two criminal schemes, one to defraud investors, the other to defraud doctors and patients.[8][60] After the indictment was issued, Holmes stepped down as CEO of Theranos but remained chair of the board.[9] The case is U.S. v. Holmes, 18-cr-00258, United States District Court for the Northern District of California and it is set to begin on July 28, 2020.[61][62] They face up to 20 years in prison.[63][64] In June 2019, Bloomberg News reported Holmes and Balwani are looking into a possible defense strategy of blaming the media for the downfall of Theranos. The lawyers are looking into whether journalist John Carreyrou's reporting caused undue influence upon government regulatory agencies in order to write a sensational story for The Wall Street Journal.[61] In October 2019, The Mercury News reported that Cooley LLP, Holmes' legal team in a class-action civil case, requested that the court allow them to stop representing her, stating that she had not paid them in a year for services, and that \"given Ms. Holmes\u2019s current financial situation, Cooley has no expectation that Ms. Holmes will ever pay it for its services as her counsel.\u201d[65] In November 2019, The Recorder reported that Senior District Judge H. Russel Holland, who was overseeing the civil case, indicated that he would allow Cooley to withdraw.[66] Holmes partnered with Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa in June 2015 to improve blood testing in Mexico.[67] In October 2015, she announced #IronSisters to help women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers.[68] She helped to draft and pass a law in Arizona to let people obtain and pay for lab tests without requiring insurance or healthcare provider approval, while misrepresenting the accuracy and effectiveness of the Theranos device.[20][69] Theranos's board and investors included many influential figures.[20][70] Holmes's first major investor was Tim Draper \u2013 Silicon Valley venture capitalist and father of Holmes's childhood friend Jesse Draper \u2013 who \"cut Holmes a check\" for $1 million upon hearing her initial pitch for the firm that would become Theranos.[71][72] Theranos's pool of major investors expanded to include:[70] Rupert Murdoch, conservative media-mogul; the Walton family, founders of retail chains Walmart and Sam's Club; the DeVos family (founders of U.S. multi-level marketing firm Amway), including Betsy DeVos, who would become Secretary of Education under U.S. President Donald Trump; the Cox family of Cox Enterprises; and Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, Mexican billionaire. All of these investors lost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars each when Theranos folded.[70] One of Holmes's first board members was George Shultz.[20][71] With Shultz's early involvement aiding Holmes's recruitment efforts, the 12-member Theranos board eventually included:[73] Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state; William Perry, a former secretary of defense; James Mattis, a future secretary of defense; Gary Roughead, a retired U.S. Navy admiral; Bill Frist, a former U.S. Senator (R-TN); Sam Nunn, a former U.S. Senator (D-GA); and former CEOs Dick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo and Riley Bechtel of Bechtel. Before the exposure and the subsequent collapse of Theranos, Holmes received widespread acclaim. In 2015, she was appointed a member of the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows[74] and was named one of TIME magazine's Most Influential People in the World in 2015.[75] Holmes received the Under 30 Doers Award from Forbes and ranked on its 2015 list of the Most Powerful Women.[76][77] She was also named Woman of the Year by Glamour and received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Pepperdine University after she delivered the commencement speech to the 2015 graduates.[78][79] Holmes was awarded the 2015 Horatio Alger Award, making her the youngest recipient in its history.[80][81] She previously had been named Fortune's Businessperson of the Year and listed on its 40 Under 40.[82][83] Following several journalistic and criminal investigations and civil suits regarding Theranos' business practices, she was charged with \"massive fraud\" by the Securities and Exchange Commission.[51] In 2016, Fortune named Holmes one of the World's Most Disappointing Leaders.[7] Before the March 2018 settlement, Holmes held a 50% stock ownership in Theranos.[19] Forbes listed her as one of America's Richest Self-Made Women in 2015 with a net worth of $4.5 billion.[36] In June 2016, Forbes released an updated valuation of $800 million for Theranos, which made Holmes's stake essentially worthless, because other investors owned preferred shares and would have been paid before Holmes, who owned only common stock.[6] Holmes reportedly owed a $25 million debt to Theranos in connection with exercising options. She did not receive any company cash from the arrangement, nor did she sell any of her shares, including those associated with the debt.[84][85][86] Holmes was romantically involved with technology entrepreneur Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, a Pakistani-born Hindu who immigrated to India and then the US.[20] She met him in 2002 at age 18, while still in school; he was 19 years older than her and married to another woman at the time.[87] Balwani divorced his wife in 2002[88] and became romantically involved with Holmes in 2003, about the same time Holmes dropped out of college,[87] and the couple moved into an apartment around 2005. Although Balwani did not officially join the company until 2009, as chief operating officer, he was advising Holmes behind the scenes before then.[87] Holmes and Balwani ran the company jointly in a corporate culture of \"secrecy and fear\".[87] He left Theranos in 2016 in the wake of investigations. The circumstances of his departure are unclear; Holmes states that she fired him, but Balwani states that he left of his own accord.[87] In early 2019, Holmes became engaged to William \"Billy\" Evans, a 27-year-old heir to the Evans Hotel Group.[89] In mid-2019, Holmes and Evans married in a private ceremony.[90] The couple live in San Francisco.[89] Holmes has been featured in a number of media works, as listed in this section and in the given citation.[91] In May 2018, author John Carreyrou released his book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup to considerable acclaim. A movie based on the book is in development, with Jennifer Lawrence in the role of Holmes and Adam McKay serving as writer and director.[92][93] In January 2019, ABC News, Nightline, and Rebecca Jarvis released a podcast and documentary about the Holmes story called The Dropout. It includes interviews and deposition tapes of key figures including Elizabeth Holmes; Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani; Christian Holmes (Elizabeth's brother); Tyler Shultz (Theranos whistleblower and grandson of Board Member George Shultz); Theranos board members Bill Frist, Gary Roughead, Robert Kovacevich; and others. There is also an interview with Jeff Coopersmith, the attorney representing Balwani.[94][71] On March 18, 2019, HBO premiered the documentary The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley, a two-hour documentary film first shown at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2019. It portrays the claims and promises made by Holmes in the last years of Theranos and how ultimately the company was brought down by the weight of many falsehoods. The documentary ends in 2018, with Holmes and Balwani indicted for multiple crimes.[95]",

In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Theranos and Holmes with deceiving investors by \"massive fraud\" through false or exaggerated claims about the accuracy of her blood-testing technology; Holmes settled the charges by paying a $500,000 fine, returning shares to the company, relinquishing her voting control of Theranos, and being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years. In June 2018, a federal grand jury indicted Holmes and former Theranos chief operating officer Ramesh Balwani on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for distributing blood tests with falsified results to consumers.[8][9] A trial is set to begin in August 2020. [10][11][12]\nThe credibility of Theranos was in part interpreted as an effect of Holmes's personal connections and ability to recruit the support of influential people including Henry Kissinger, Hillary Clinton, George Shultz, James Mattis, and Betsy DeVos. Holmes was in a relationship with her chief operating officer Ramesh Balwani, and after the demise of Theranos she married hotel heir Billy Evans.[13]\nHolmes's career, the rise and dissolution of her company, and the subsequent fallout are the subject of a book, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, by the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, and an HBO documentary feature film, The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley.\nHolmes was born in Washington, D.C.[14] Her father, Christian Rasmus Holmes IV, was a vice president at Enron, after which he held executive positions in government agencies such as USAID, the EPA, and USTDA.[15][16][17] Her mother, Noel Anne (Daoust), worked as a Congressional committee staffer.[18]\nHolmes attended St. John's School in Houston.[14] During high school, she was interested in computer programming and claims she started her first business selling C++ compilers to Chinese universities.[19] Her parents had arranged Mandarin Chinese home tutoring, and partway through high school, Holmes began attending Stanford University's summer Mandarin program.[20] In 2001, Holmes attended Stanford, where she studied chemical engineering, and worked as a student researcher and laboratory assistant in the School of Engineering.[18]\nAfter the end of her freshman year, Holmes worked in a laboratory at the Genome Institute of Singapore testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome through the collection of blood samples with syringes.[19] She filed her first patent application on a wearable drug-delivery patch in 2003.[21][22] In March 2004, she dropped out of Stanford's School of Engineering and used her tuition money as seed funding for a consumer healthcare technology company.[18][23]\nHolmes founded the company Real-Time Cures in Palo Alto, California, to \"democratize healthcare\".[19][24][25][26] She sought to perform blood tests using only small amounts of blood. Holmes described her fear of needles as a motivation.[17][25] When Holmes initially pitched the idea to reap \"vast amounts of data from a few droplets of blood derived from the tip of a finger\" to her medicine professor Phyllis Gardner at Stanford, Gardner responded, \"I don't think your idea is going to work\", explaining it was impossible to do what Holmes was claiming could be done. Several other expert medical professors told Holmes the same thing.[17] However, Holmes did not relent, and succeeded in getting her advisor and dean at the School of Engineering, Channing Robertson, to back her idea.[17]\nIn April 2004, Holmes incorporated the company as Theranos (a portmanteau of \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\")[27] and rented the basement of a group college house.[18] At that time, Holmes hired her first employee and rented lab space.[28] Robertson became the company's first board member and introduced Holmes to venture capitalists.[18]\nHolmes was an admirer of Apple founder Steve Jobs, and deliberately copied his style, frequently dressing in a black turtleneck sweater, as Jobs did.[29] During most of her public appearances, she spoke in an unusually deep baritone voice, although a former Theranos colleague later claimed that her natural voice was actually a few octaves higher.[20] Her family, meanwhile, has maintained that her baritone voice is authentic.[30]\nTheranos experienced a spectacular rise before its ultimate downfall. By December 2004, Holmes had raised $6 million to fund the firm.[18][28] By the end of 2010, Theranos had more than $92 million in venture capital.[21] In July 2011, Holmes was introduced to former secretary of state George Shultz. After a two-hour meeting, he joined the Theranos board of directors.[31] Holmes was recognized for forming \"the most illustrious board in U.S. corporate history\" over the next three years.[32]\nHolmes operated Theranos in \"stealth mode\" without press releases or a company website until September 2013, when the company announced a partnership with Walgreens to launch in-store blood sample collection centers.[33][34] Media attention increased in 2014, when Holmes appeared on the covers of Fortune, Forbes, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and Inc.[35] Forbes recognized Holmes as the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and ranked her #110 on the Forbes 400 in 2014. Theranos was valued at $9 billion with more than $400 million in venture capital.[18][36] By the end of 2014, her name appeared on 18 U.S. patents and 66 foreign patents.[22] During 2015, Holmes established agreements with Cleveland Clinic, Capital BlueCross, and AmeriHealth Caritas to use Theranos technology.[21]\nJohn Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal initiated a secret, months-long investigation of Theranos after he received a tip from a medical expert who thought the blood testing device seemed suspicious.[20] Carreyrou spoke to ex-employee whistleblowers and obtained company documents. On learning of the investigation, Holmes initiated through her lawyer David Boies a campaign to stop Carreyrou from publishing, by levying legal and financial threats against the Journal and the whistleblowers.[20]\nIn October 2015, despite Boies' legal threats and strong-arm tactics, Carreyrou published a \"bombshell article\"[37] that the Edison blood testing device by Theranos gave inaccurate results, and that the company used commercially available machines for most testing, as well as other incriminating details.[38] This was the first serious criticism of Theranos in the press, and a further series of articles by Carreyrou followed with more damning details.\nHolmes denied all the claims, calling the newspaper a \"tabloid\" and promising the company would publish data on the accuracy of its tests.[39][40] She appeared on Jim Cramer's Mad Money the same evening the article was published. Cramer said, \"The article was pretty brutal\", to which Holmes responded, \"This is what happens when you work to change things, first they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world.\"[41]\nIn January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sent a warning letter to Theranos after an inspection of its Newark, California laboratory uncovered irregularities with staff proficiency, procedures, and equipment.[42] CMS regulators proposed a two-year ban on Holmes from owning or operating a lab after the company had not fixed problems in its California lab in March 2016.[43] On The Today Show, Holmes said she was \"devastated we did not catch and fix these issues faster\" and the lab would be rebuilt with help from a new scientific and medical advisory board.[44]\nIn July 2016, CMS banned Holmes from owning, operating, or directing a blood-testing service for a period of two years. The company appealed that decision to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services appeals board.[17][45]  Shortly thereafter, Walgreens ended its relationship with Theranos and closed its in-store blood collection centers. The FDA also ordered the company to cease using its Capillary Tube Nanotainer device, one of its core inventions.[46]\nIn 2017, the State of Arizona filed suit against Theranos, alleging that the company had sold 1.5 million blood tests to Arizonans while concealing or misrepresenting important facts about those tests. The company settled the lawsuit in April of that year by agreeing to refund the cost of the tests to Arizona consumers, and to pay $225,000 in civil fines and attorney fees, for a total of $4.65 million.[47] Other reported ongoing actions include civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, an unspecified FBI investigation, and two class action fraud lawsuits. Holmes denied any wrongdoing.[17]\nOn May 16, 2017, approximately 99 percent of Theranos shareholders reached an agreement with the company to dismiss all current and potential litigation in exchange for shares of preferred stock.  Holmes released a portion of her equity to offset any dilution of stock value to non-participating shareholders.[48][49]\nOn March 14, 2018, Holmes settled an SEC lawsuit.[50] The charges of fraud included the company's false claim that its technology was being used by the U.S. Department of Defense in combat situations.[51] The company also lied when it claimed to have a $100 million revenue stream in 2014. That year, the company only made $100,000.[52] The terms of Holmes' settlement included surrendering voting control of Theranos, a ban on holding an officer position in a public company for 10 years, and a $500,000 fine.[53][54][55]\nAt its height, Theranos had more than 800 employees.[56] It fired 340 staff members in October 2016 and an additional 155 employees in January 2017.[57] In April 2018, Theranos filed a WARN Act notice with the State of California announcing its plans to permanently lay off 105 employees, leaving it with fewer than two dozen employees.[56][58] Most of the remaining employees were laid off in August 2018. On September 5, 2018, the company announced that it has begun the process of formally dissolving, with its remaining cash and assets to be distributed to its creditors.[59]\nOn June 15, 2018, following an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco that lasted more than two years, a federal grand jury indicted Holmes and former Theranos chief operating officer and president Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that Holmes and Balwani engaged in two criminal schemes, one to defraud investors, the other to defraud doctors and patients.[8][60] After the indictment was issued, Holmes stepped down as CEO of Theranos but remained chair of the board.[9]\nThe case is U.S. v. Holmes, 18-cr-00258, United States District Court for the Northern District of California and it is set to begin on July 28, 2020.[61][62] They face up to 20 years in prison.[63][64]\nIn June 2019, Bloomberg News reported Holmes and Balwani are looking into a possible defense strategy of blaming the media for the downfall of Theranos. The lawyers are looking into whether journalist John Carreyrou's reporting caused undue influence upon government regulatory agencies in order to write a sensational story for The Wall Street Journal.[61]\nIn October 2019, The Mercury News reported that Cooley LLP, Holmes' legal team in a class-action civil case, requested that the court allow them to stop representing her, stating that she had not paid them in a year for services, and that \"given Ms. Holmes\u2019s current financial situation, Cooley has no expectation that Ms. Holmes will ever pay it for its services as her counsel.\u201d[65] In November 2019, The Recorder reported that Senior District Judge H. Russel Holland, who was overseeing the civil case, indicated that he would allow Cooley to withdraw.[66]\nHolmes partnered with Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa in June 2015 to improve blood testing in Mexico.[67] In October 2015, she announced #IronSisters to help women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers.[68] She helped to draft and pass a law in Arizona to let people obtain and pay for lab tests without requiring insurance or healthcare provider approval, while misrepresenting the accuracy and effectiveness of the Theranos device.[20][69]\nTheranos's board and investors included many influential figures.[20][70] Holmes's first major investor was Tim Draper \u2013 Silicon Valley venture capitalist and father of Holmes's childhood friend Jesse Draper \u2013 who \"cut Holmes a check\" for $1 million upon hearing her initial pitch for the firm that would become Theranos.[71][72] Theranos's pool of major investors expanded to include:[70] Rupert Murdoch, conservative media-mogul; the Walton family, founders of retail chains Walmart and Sam's Club; the DeVos family (founders of U.S. multi-level marketing firm Amway), including Betsy DeVos, who would become Secretary of Education under U.S. President Donald Trump; the Cox family of Cox Enterprises; and Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, Mexican billionaire. All of these investors lost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars each when Theranos folded.[70]\nOne of Holmes's first board members was George Shultz.[20][71] With Shultz's early involvement aiding Holmes's recruitment efforts, the 12-member Theranos board eventually included:[73] Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state; William Perry, a former secretary of defense; James Mattis, a future secretary of defense; Gary Roughead, a retired U.S. Navy admiral; Bill Frist, a former U.S. Senator (R-TN); Sam Nunn, a former U.S. Senator (D-GA); and former CEOs Dick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo and Riley Bechtel of Bechtel.\nBefore the exposure and the subsequent collapse of Theranos, Holmes received widespread acclaim.  In 2015, she was appointed a member of the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows[74] and was named one of TIME magazine's Most Influential People in the World in 2015.[75] Holmes received the Under 30 Doers Award from Forbes and ranked on its 2015 list of the Most Powerful Women.[76][77] She was also named Woman of the Year by Glamour and received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Pepperdine University after she delivered the commencement speech to the 2015 graduates.[78][79] Holmes was awarded the 2015 Horatio Alger Award, making her the youngest recipient in its history.[80][81] She previously had been named Fortune's Businessperson of the Year and listed on its 40 Under 40.[82][83]\nFollowing several journalistic and criminal investigations and civil suits regarding Theranos' business practices, she was charged with \"massive fraud\" by the Securities and Exchange Commission.[51] In 2016, Fortune named Holmes one of the World's Most Disappointing Leaders.[7]\nBefore the March 2018 settlement, Holmes held a 50% stock ownership in Theranos.[19] Forbes listed her as one of America's Richest Self-Made Women in 2015 with a net worth of $4.5 billion.[36] In June 2016, Forbes released an updated valuation of $800 million for Theranos, which made Holmes's stake essentially worthless, because other investors owned preferred shares and would have been paid before Holmes, who owned only common stock.[6] Holmes reportedly owed a $25 million debt to Theranos in connection with exercising options. She did not receive any company cash from the arrangement, nor did she sell any of her shares, including those associated with the debt.[84][85][86]\nHolmes was romantically involved with technology entrepreneur Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, a Pakistani-born Hindu who immigrated to India and then the US.[20] She met him in 2002 at age 18, while still in school; he was 19 years older than her and married to another woman at the time.[87] Balwani divorced his wife in 2002[88] and became romantically involved with Holmes in 2003, about the same time Holmes dropped out of college,[87] and the couple moved into an apartment around 2005. Although Balwani did not officially join the company until 2009, as chief operating officer, he was advising Holmes behind the scenes before then.[87] Holmes and Balwani ran the company jointly in a corporate culture of \"secrecy and fear\".[87] He left Theranos in 2016 in the wake of investigations. The circumstances of his departure are unclear; Holmes states that she fired him, but Balwani states that he left of his own accord.[87]\nIn early 2019, Holmes became engaged to William \"Billy\" Evans, a 27-year-old heir to the Evans Hotel Group.[89] In mid-2019, Holmes and Evans married in a private ceremony.[90] The couple live in San Francisco.[89]\nHolmes has been featured in a number of media works, as listed in this section and in the given citation.[91]\nIn May 2018, author John Carreyrou released his book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup to considerable acclaim. A movie based on the book is in development, with Jennifer Lawrence in the role of Holmes and Adam McKay serving as writer and director.[92][93]\nIn January 2019, ABC News, Nightline, and Rebecca Jarvis released a podcast and documentary about the Holmes story called The Dropout. It includes interviews and deposition tapes of key figures including Elizabeth Holmes; Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani; Christian Holmes (Elizabeth's brother); Tyler Shultz (Theranos whistleblower and grandson of Board Member George Shultz); Theranos board members Bill Frist, Gary Roughead, Robert Kovacevich; and others. There is also an interview with Jeff Coopersmith, the attorney representing Balwani.[94][71]\nOn March 18, 2019, HBO premiered the documentary The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley, a two-hour documentary film first shown at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2019. It portrays the claims and promises made by Holmes in the last years of Theranos and how ultimately the company was brought down by the weight of many falsehoods. The documentary ends in 2018, with Holmes and Balwani indicted for multiple crimes.[95]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJared Corey Kushner (born January 10, 1981) is an American investor, real-estate developer, and newspaper publisher who is currently senior advisor to his father-in-law, Donald Trump, the president of the United States. Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer Charles Kushner, the son of Jewish immigrants from the USSR, and is married to Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company Kushner Companies, which launched his business career. He later also bought Observer Media, publisher of the New York Observer. He is the co-founder and part owner of Cadre, an online real-estate investment platform. During the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, Kushner helped develop and run Trump's digital media strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor. Kushner was born in Livingston, New Jersey, to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and Charles Kushner, a real-estate developer.[2] His paternal grandparents, Reichel and Joseph Kushner, were Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from Navahrudak, now in Belarus.[3][4] Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's maternal grandfather.[5] Raised in a Modern Orthodox Jewish family,[6] Kushner graduated from the Frisch School, a Modern Orthodox yeshiva high school, in 1999. He was an honors student and a member of the debate, hockey, and, basketball teams.[7] Kushner enrolled at Harvard University in 1999. According to journalist Daniel Golden, Kushner was accepted due to his father's donations and history with the school.[8][9] He was elected into the Fly Club, supported the campus Chabad house,[10][11] and bought and sold real estate in Somerville, Massachusetts, as a vice president of Somerville Building Associates (a division of Kushner Companies), returning a profit of $20 million by its dissolution in 2005.[12][13][14] Kushner graduated from Harvard in 2003 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government.[15][16] Kushner graduated from New York University in 2007 with dual JD/MBA degrees. He interned at Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office, and at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP.[17] Following his father's conviction for fraud in 2005 and subsequent incarceration, Jared Kushner took over the management of his father's real estate company.[18] As of 2019[update], Kushner's net worth is estimated at about $800 million.[19] Kushner was a real-estate investor, and increased Kushner Companies' presence in the New York City real-estate market.[20] Kushner Companies purchased the office building at 666 Fifth Avenue in 2007, for a then-record price of $1.8 billion, most of it borrowed.[21] He assumed the role of CEO in 2008.[22] Following the property crash that year, the cash flow generated by the property was insufficient to cover its debt service, and the Kushners were forced to sell the retail footage to Stanley Chera[23] and bring in Vornado Realty Trust as a 50% equity partner in the ownership of the building.[24] By that time, Kushner Companies had lost more than $90 million on its investment.[25] He was the face of the deal but his father Charles Kushner pushed him to do the deal.[26] On August 18, 2014, Kushner acquired a three-building apartment portfolio in Middle River, Maryland, for $38 million with Aion Partners. In 2013\u20132014, he and his company acquired more than 11,000 units throughout New York, New Jersey, and the Baltimore area.[27] In May 2015, he purchased 50.1% of the Times Square Building from Africa Israel Investments Ltd. for $295 million.[28] In 2014, Kushner, with his brother Joshua and Ryan Williams, co-founded Cadre (now RealCadre LLC), an online real-estate investment platform. His business partners included Goldman Sachs and billionaire George Soros, a top Democratic Party donor.[29][30][31] In early 2015, Soros Fund Management financed the startup with a $250 million credit line.[29][32] Kushner did not identify these business relationships in his January 2017 government financial-disclosure form.[29][33] In 2006, Kushner purchased The New York Observer, a weekly New York City newspaper, for $10\u00a0million,[34] using money he says he earned during his college years by closing deals on residential buildings in Somerville, Massachusetts,[35] with family members providing the backing for his investments.[36] After purchasing the Observer, Kushner published it in tabloid format.[37] Since then, he has been credited with increasing the Observer's online presence and expanding the Observer Media Group.[38][39] With no substantial experience in journalism, Kushner could not establish a good relationship with the newspaper's veteran editor-in-chief, Peter W. Kaplan.[40] \"This guy doesn't know what he doesn't know\", Kaplan remarked about Kushner, to colleagues, at the time.[40] As a result of his differences with Kushner, Kaplan quit his position. Kaplan was followed by a series of short-lived successors until Kushner hired Elizabeth Spiers in 2011.[41] It has been alleged that Kushner used Observer as propaganda against rivals in real estate.[41][42] Spiers left the newspaper in 2012. In January 2013, Kushner hired a new editor-in-chief, Ken Kurson. Kurson had been a consultant to Republican political candidates in New Jersey.[41] According to Vanity Fair, under Kushner, the \"Observer has lost virtually all of its cultural currency among New York's elite, but the paper is now profitable and reporting traffic growth ... [it] boasts 6 million unique visitors per month, up from 1.3 million in January 2013\".[43] In April 2016, the New York Observer became one of only a handful of newspapers to officially endorse United States presidential candidate Donald Trump in the Republican primary, but the paper ended the campaign period by choosing not to back any presidential candidate at all.[44][45] Kushner stepped down from his newspaper role in January 2017 to pursue a role in President Donald Trump's administration. He was replaced by his brother-in-law, Joseph Meyer.[46] Jared Kushner had been a lifelong Democrat prior to his father-in-law Donald Trump entering politics.[47] He had donated over $10,000 to Democratic campaigns[48] starting at young age of 11. In 2008 he donated to the campaign for Hillary Clinton and his newspaper the New York Observer endorsed Barack Obama over John McCain in the US presidential election.[49] After expressing disappointment with Barack Obama, however, he endorsed Republican U.S. presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 via the New York Observer.[50] In 2014 he continued to donate to Democratic groups,[49] but he then continued his \"ideological conversion\" by joining his father-in-law Donald Trump's nascent US presidential campaign in the field of the Republican candidates in 2015.[55] Kushner had no prior involvement in campaign politics or in government before Trump's campaign.[56] From the outset of the presidential campaign of his father-in-law Donald Trump, Kushner was the architect of Trump's digital, online, and social media campaigns, enlisting talent from Silicon Valley to run a 100-person social-media team dubbed \"Project Alamo\".[57] Kushner, together with Paul Manafort and Brad Parscale, hired Steve Bannon's firm Cambridge Analytica to support the Trump campaign.[58] Kushner has also helped as a speechwriter, and was tasked with working to establish a plan for Trump's White House transition team.[59] He was for a time seen as Trump's de facto campaign manager, succeeding Corey Lewandowski, who was fired in part on Kushner's recommendation in June 2016.[60] He had been intimately involved with campaign strategy, coordinating Trump's visit in late August to Mexico, and he is believed to be responsible for the choice of Mike Pence as Trump's running mate.[57][61] Kushner's \"sprawling digital fundraising database and social media campaign\" has been described as \"the locus of his father-in-law's presidential bid\".[62] According to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt (who worked on technology for Hillary Clinton's campaign), Kushner's role in the 2016 election was its biggest surprise. Schmidt told Forbes, \"Best I can tell, he actually ran the campaign and did it with essentially no resources.\"[63] Federal Election Commission filings indicate the Trump campaign spent $343 million, about 59 percent as much as the Clinton campaign.[64] On July 5, 2016, Kushner wrote an open letter in the New York Observer addressing the controversy around a tweet from the Trump campaign containing allegedly anti-Semitic imagery. He was responding to his own paper's editorial by Dana Schwartz criticizing Kushner's involvement with the Trump campaign.[65] In the letter, Kushner wrote, \"In my opinion, accusations like 'racist' and 'anti-Semite' are being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless.\"[66] During the presidential transition, Kushner was said to be his father-in-law's \"confidant\",[67] and one of Donald Trump's closest advisors, even more so than Trump's four adult children.[68] Trump was reported to have requested the top-secret security clearance for him to attend the presidential daily intelligence briefings as his staff-level companion, along with General Mike Flynn, who already had the clearance prior to his resignation.[69] Kushner was reportedly an influential factor behind the firing of New Jersey governor Chris Christie as head of the transition team, as well as the dismissal from the Donald Trump transition team of anyone connected to Christie.[70][71] An anonymous source familiar with the transition told Politico, \"Jared doesn't like Christie... He's always held [the prosecution of his father] against Christie.\"[72] Kushner told Forbes that the reports that he was involved in Christie's dismissal were false: \"Six months ago, Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together... I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\"[73] On January 9, 2017, Kushner was named Senior Advisor to the President[74] (formally, \"Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor\"[75]). He consequently resigned as CEO of Kushner Companies, and as publisher of the Observer.[76] Kushner's appointment was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law.[77] On January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion stating, \"The President may appoint relatives to his immediate staff of advisors.\"[78][79] Kushner was sworn in on January 22, 2017.[80] Kushner operated on a temporary security clearance for more than a year,[81][82] with access to classified information, until he was granted permanent access in May 2018.[83] On February 27, 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly downgraded Kushner's interim security clearance to \"secret\" status, along with other White House staffers working with interim security clearances.[84][85][86] He worked in the White House based on an interim security clearance[87] until May 2018, when he passed a comprehensive background investigation.[88] The New York Times reported in February 2019 that in May 2018 Trump ordered Kelly to grant Kushner a top-secret clearance, which Kelly contemporaneously documented in an internal memo. Trump had asserted in January 2019 that he had no role in directing officials to grant Kushner the clearance.[89] Kushner's office is physically the closest to the Oval Office.[90] Trump put Kushner in charge of brokering peace in Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, as well as making deals with foreign countries, although in what way he is in charge is unclear.[91][92][93] On August 24, 2017, Kushner traveled to Israel to talk to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu[94] (with whom Kushner has longstanding personal links and family ties, causing Palestinians to distrust him[95][96]). He then traveled to Palestine to meet President Mahmoud Abbas in an attempt to restart a peace process in the Middle East.[94] Furthermore, after Donald Trump became President-elect, Kushner and his wife met with Japanese Prime Minister and other Japanese officials, while his wife was conducting a licensing deal between her namesake clothing brand and a Japanese government-owned company.[97] His wife sat in on a meeting between her father, then-president-elect Donald Trump, and Japan's prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.[98] In late March 2017, Jared Kushner was also given the new role of leading the \"White House Office of American Innovation\",[99][100] where Kushner reportedly has been focusing on improving governmental efforts with regard to Veterans Affairs, information-technology contracting, and the opioid crisis.[101] Kushner was involved in the sale of $100+ billion of arms to Saudi Arabia, and during a meeting with Saudi officials at the White House, he called Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson to ask for a lower price on a radar system to detect ballistic missiles.[102] Kushner's business activities in China have drawn scrutiny for mixing government with business.[103][104][105] Kushner's investments in real estate and financial services have also drawn controversy for conflicts of interest.[106][107] In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that he had failed to disclose all required financial information in his security clearance applications, including that he owes $1 billion in loans.[33][108] Abbe Lowell, the lawyer of Kushner, in a statement admitted that Kushner used private e-mail for official White House business. No classified or privileged information was used on this account. Kushner's father-in-law repeatedly criticized his opponent Hillary Clinton for her personal e-mail usage in her role as Secretary of State.[109] In an HBO/Axios interview released in June 2019, Kushner denied that President Trump was a racist. When asked whether birther conspiracy theories about President Obama (which Trump pushed extensively for a number of years) were racist, Kushner did not answer, saying instead twice, \"Look, I wasn\u2019t really involved in that.\"[110][111] In the interview, Kushner spoke about how great the United States was for accepting his grandparents as refugees, \"It's a great reminder of how great this country is.\"[111] In the same interview, he defended the Trump administration's decision to drastically reduce the number of refugees accepted by the United States (the lowest level in 40 years).[112] Kushner helped to spearhead creation of the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act (FIRST STEP ACT, H.R. 5682) and its endorsement by the House Judiciary Committee on May 9, 2018.[113][114][115] Kushner's contacts with Russian officials have come under scrutiny as part of the larger federal investigation into Russian interference in the election.[116] Kushner has said he had four meetings with Russians during the 2016 campaign and presidential transition, and that none of those Russian contacts were improper.[117] In June 2016, an agent of Emin Agalarov reportedly offered Donald Trump Jr., Kushner's brother-in-law, compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government if he met with a lawyer connected to the Kremlin.[118] A meeting took place on June 9, 2016, and included Kushner, Trump Jr., and Paul Manafort, who was then chairman of the presidential campaign, who met with Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower.[119] According to Rinat Akhmetshin, who was also present at the meeting, Veselnitskaya claimed to have evidence of \"violations of Russian law by a Democratic donor\", and that the \"Russian lawyer described her findings at the meeting and left a document about them with Trump Jr. and the others\".[120] The Democratic National Committee cyber attacks were revealed later that week.[118] Between April and November 2016, Kushner had two undisclosed phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak.[121] (In May 2017, Kushner's attorney Jamie Gorelick told Reuters that Kushner had participated in \"thousands of calls in this time period\" and did not recall any with Kislyak.[121]) In December 2016, Kushner met with Kislyak.[122] That month, U.S. intelligence officials who were monitoring Kislyak reportedly overheard him relaying to Moscow a request from Kushner to establish a \"secret and secure communications channel\" with the Kremlin using Russian diplomatic facilities. Kislyak reportedly was \"taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate \u2013 a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team\".[123][124] Also in December 2016, Kushner met with Sergey N. Gorkov, a trained Russian spy who then headed Vnesheconombank (VEB), a Russian state-owned bank.[122][125][126] Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Kushner met with Gorkov briefly as part of his role in the transition, and as a diplomatic conduit to the State Department.[127] However, VEB has stated that Gorkov met with Kushner on a private matter concerning his family's real estate corporation, Kushner Companies, even though VEB has been under international sanctions since July 2014.[128] In July 2017, Kushner appeared before both the House and Senate intelligence committees in closed session as part of their investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.[129] He also released a public statement.[130] In October 2017 the Senate Judiciary Committee requested numerous documents from Kushner. Kushner's attorneys gave the committee many documents on November 3, but the committee followed up on November 16 with a request for many additional documents it said had not been produced.[131] In early November 2017, Kushner was interviewed by investigators from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office. Reportedly the interview focused on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.[132] On December 1, Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI, as part of a plea bargain. Bloomberg reported that Kushner is most likely the \"senior member of the Trump transition team,\" mentioned in Flynn's plea documents, who is said to have ordered Flynn to contact Russia.[133] Mueller is investigating meetings between Trump associates including Kushner and George Nader, an emissary representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. In August 2016, Nader offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[134] In December 2016, Nader attended a New York meeting between the United Arab Emirates officials and Kushner, Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon.[135] Mueller is also investigating Kushner's possible ties to Qatar, Israel and China.[136] The transcript of Kushner's interview with FBI investigators was not publicly released in January 2020 as ordered by a federal judge, as the Justice Department stated it required a security review by an unnamed intelligence agency.[137] The transcript was released on February 3, redacted nearly in its entirety.[138][139] On January 18, 2017, Kushner requested Top Secret security clearance,[122] using \"Standard Form 86 (SF86): Questionnaire for National Security Positions\".[140][141] The request omitted dozens of pertinent contacts with foreign officials, including the meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov.[122] Failure to disclose pertinent contacts can cause security clearances to be declined or revoked, and an intentional failure to disclose can result in imprisonment.[142] Kushner's lawyers said that the omissions were \"an oversight\",[143] and that \"a member of [Kushner's] staff had prematurely hit the 'send' button\" before the form was completed.[140] By July 2017, Kushner had resubmitted his SF86, this time disclosing contacts with foreign nationals.[142] This was the first time that government officials were made aware of the June 2016 Trump campaign\u2013Russian meeting and Kushner's role in it.[142] On September 15, 2017, Carl Kline, the director of the personnel security office within the Executive Office of President Trump, recorded Kushner as having an interim Top Secret/SCI security clearance.[89] Kushner and his wife were among at least 48 officials granted interim clearance giving them access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI): detailed accounts of intelligence sources and methods.[144][145] In February 2018, all White House staff holding interim Top Secret/SCI security clearances, including Kushner, were downgraded to Secret clearances, and Trump said that he would not intervene to grant Kushner a permanent security clearance.[146] That day, White House sources said that part of the reason Kushner had not yet been granted permanent security clearance was that he was under investigation by Mueller.[147] On May 23, 2018, Kushner received permanent Top Secret security clearance.[148][149] In January 2019, Trump told the New York Times that he had not intervened to grant Kushner's security clearances.[89][150] On February 8, 2019, Kushner's wife Ivanka also denied that Trump had intervened to grant her or Kushner's security clearances.[150][151][152] However, on February 28, 2019, CNN (citing three anonymous sources) and The New York Times (citing four anonymous sources) reported that Trump had intervened to order the granting of those clearances.[89][150][153] Reportedly, this is the first time a U.S. President has intervened in such a way.[147] Kushner has a younger brother, Joshua, and two sisters, Dara and Nicole.[154] He married Ivanka Trump in a Jewish ceremony on October 25, 2009. They had met in 2005 through mutual friends.[155][156][157] Kushner and his wife (who converted to Judaism in 2009[158]) are Modern Orthodox Jews, keep a kosher home, and observe the Jewish Shabbat.[159][160][161] They have three children, a daughter born in July 2011[162] and two sons born in October 2013[163] and March 2016.[164] In 2017, federal disclosures suggested Kushner and his wife had assets worth at least $240 million, and as much as $740 million.[106][165] They also have an art collection, estimated to be worth millions that was not mentioned in the financial disclosures initially,[166] and enjoy visiting art studios.[167] The United States Office of Government Ethics has said that the updated disclosures comply with the regulations and laws.[168] When asked about his father-in-law President Donald Trump, Kushner told CNN's Van Jones: \"He's a black swan. He's been a black swan all his life.\"[169][ambiguous]",

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer Charles Kushner, the son of Jewish immigrants from the USSR, and is married to Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company Kushner Companies, which launched his business career. He later also bought Observer Media, publisher of the New York Observer. He is the co-founder and part owner of Cadre, an online real-estate investment platform.\nDuring the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, Kushner helped develop and run Trump's digital media strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor.\nKushner was born in Livingston, New Jersey, to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and Charles Kushner, a real-estate developer.[2] His paternal grandparents, Reichel and Joseph Kushner, were Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from Navahrudak, now in Belarus.[3][4] Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's maternal grandfather.[5]\nRaised in a Modern Orthodox Jewish family,[6] Kushner graduated from the Frisch School, a Modern Orthodox yeshiva high school, in 1999. He was an honors student and a member of the debate, hockey, and, basketball teams.[7]\nKushner enrolled at Harvard University in 1999. According to journalist Daniel Golden, Kushner was accepted due to his father's donations and history with the school.[8][9] He was elected into the Fly Club, supported the campus Chabad house,[10][11] and bought and sold real estate in Somerville, Massachusetts, as a vice president of Somerville Building Associates (a division of Kushner Companies), returning a profit of $20 million by its dissolution in 2005.[12][13][14] Kushner graduated from Harvard in 2003 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government.[15][16]\nKushner graduated from New York University in 2007 with dual JD/MBA degrees. He interned at Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office, and at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP.[17]\nFollowing his father's conviction for fraud in 2005 and subsequent incarceration, Jared Kushner took over the management of his father's real estate company.[18] As of 2019[update], Kushner's net worth is estimated at about $800 million.[19]\nKushner was a real-estate investor, and increased Kushner Companies' presence in the New York City real-estate market.[20]\nKushner Companies purchased the office building at 666 Fifth Avenue in 2007, for a then-record price of $1.8 billion, most of it borrowed.[21] He assumed the role of CEO in 2008.[22] Following the property crash that year, the cash flow generated by the property was insufficient to cover its debt service, and the Kushners were forced to sell the retail footage to Stanley Chera[23] and bring in Vornado Realty Trust as a 50% equity partner in the ownership of the building.[24] By that time, Kushner Companies had lost more than $90 million on its investment.[25] He was the face of the deal but his father Charles Kushner pushed him to do the deal.[26]\nOn August 18, 2014, Kushner acquired a three-building apartment portfolio in Middle River, Maryland, for $38 million with Aion Partners. In 2013\u20132014, he and his company acquired more than 11,000 units throughout New York, New Jersey, and the Baltimore area.[27] In May 2015, he purchased 50.1% of the Times Square Building from Africa Israel Investments Ltd. for $295 million.[28]\nIn 2014, Kushner, with his brother Joshua and Ryan Williams, co-founded Cadre (now RealCadre LLC), an online real-estate investment platform. His business partners included Goldman Sachs and billionaire George Soros, a top Democratic Party donor.[29][30][31] In early 2015, Soros Fund Management financed the startup with a $250 million credit line.[29][32] Kushner did not identify these business relationships in his January 2017 government financial-disclosure form.[29][33]\nIn 2006, Kushner purchased The New York Observer, a weekly New York City newspaper, for $10\u00a0million,[34] using money he says he earned during his college years by closing deals on residential buildings in Somerville, Massachusetts,[35] with family members providing the backing for his investments.[36]\nAfter purchasing the Observer, Kushner published it in tabloid format.[37] Since then, he has been credited with increasing the Observer's online presence and expanding the Observer Media Group.[38][39] With no substantial experience in journalism, Kushner could not establish a good relationship with the newspaper's veteran editor-in-chief, Peter W. Kaplan.[40] \"This guy doesn't know what he doesn't know\", Kaplan remarked about Kushner, to colleagues, at the time.[40] As a result of his differences with Kushner, Kaplan quit his position. Kaplan was followed by a series of short-lived successors until Kushner hired Elizabeth Spiers in 2011.[41] It has been alleged that Kushner used Observer as propaganda against rivals in real estate.[41][42] Spiers left the newspaper in 2012. In January 2013, Kushner hired a new editor-in-chief, Ken Kurson. Kurson had been a consultant to Republican political candidates in New Jersey.[41]\nAccording to Vanity Fair, under Kushner, the \"Observer has lost virtually all of its cultural currency among New York's elite, but the paper is now profitable and reporting traffic growth ... [it] boasts 6 million unique visitors per month, up from 1.3 million in January 2013\".[43] In April 2016, the New York Observer became one of only a handful of newspapers to officially endorse United States presidential candidate Donald Trump in the Republican primary, but the paper ended the campaign period by choosing not to back any presidential candidate at all.[44][45]\nKushner stepped down from his newspaper role in January 2017 to pursue a role in President Donald Trump's administration. He was replaced by his brother-in-law, Joseph Meyer.[46]\nJared Kushner had been a lifelong Democrat prior to his father-in-law Donald Trump entering politics.[47] He had donated over $10,000 to Democratic campaigns[48] starting at young age of 11. In 2008 he donated to the campaign for Hillary Clinton and his newspaper the New York Observer endorsed Barack Obama over John McCain in the US presidential election.[49] After expressing disappointment with Barack Obama, however, he endorsed Republican U.S. presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 via the New York Observer.[50] In 2014 he continued to donate to Democratic groups,[49] but he then continued his \"ideological conversion\" by joining his father-in-law Donald Trump's nascent US presidential campaign in the field of the Republican candidates in 2015.[55] Kushner had no prior involvement in campaign politics or in government before Trump's campaign.[56]\nFrom the outset of the presidential campaign of his father-in-law Donald Trump, Kushner was the architect of Trump's digital, online, and social media campaigns, enlisting talent from Silicon Valley to run a 100-person social-media team dubbed \"Project Alamo\".[57] Kushner, together with Paul Manafort and Brad Parscale, hired Steve Bannon's firm Cambridge Analytica to support the Trump campaign.[58] Kushner has also helped as a speechwriter, and was tasked with working to establish a plan for Trump's White House transition team.[59] He was for a time seen as Trump's de facto campaign manager, succeeding Corey Lewandowski, who was fired in part on Kushner's recommendation in June 2016.[60] He had been intimately involved with campaign strategy, coordinating Trump's visit in late August to Mexico, and he is believed to be responsible for the choice of Mike Pence as Trump's running mate.[57][61] Kushner's \"sprawling digital fundraising database and social media campaign\" has been described as \"the locus of his father-in-law's presidential bid\".[62]\nAccording to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt (who worked on technology for Hillary Clinton's campaign), Kushner's role in the 2016 election was its biggest surprise. Schmidt told Forbes, \"Best I can tell, he actually ran the campaign and did it with essentially no resources.\"[63] Federal Election Commission filings indicate the Trump campaign spent $343 million, about 59 percent as much as the Clinton campaign.[64]\nOn July 5, 2016, Kushner wrote an open letter in the New York Observer addressing the controversy around a tweet from the Trump campaign containing allegedly anti-Semitic imagery. He was responding to his own paper's editorial by Dana Schwartz criticizing Kushner's involvement with the Trump campaign.[65] In the letter, Kushner wrote, \"In my opinion, accusations like 'racist' and 'anti-Semite' are being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless.\"[66]\nDuring the presidential transition, Kushner was said to be his father-in-law's \"confidant\",[67] and one of Donald Trump's closest advisors, even more so than Trump's four adult children.[68] Trump was reported to have requested the top-secret security clearance for him to attend the presidential daily intelligence briefings as his staff-level companion, along with General Mike Flynn, who already had the clearance prior to his resignation.[69]\nKushner was reportedly an influential factor behind the firing of New Jersey governor Chris Christie as head of the transition team, as well as the dismissal from the Donald Trump transition team of anyone connected to Christie.[70][71] An anonymous source familiar with the transition told Politico, \"Jared doesn't like Christie... He's always held [the prosecution of his father] against Christie.\"[72] Kushner told Forbes that the reports that he was involved in Christie's dismissal were false: \"Six months ago, Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together... I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\"[73]\nOn January 9, 2017, Kushner was named Senior Advisor to the President[74] (formally, \"Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor\"[75]). He consequently resigned as CEO of Kushner Companies, and as publisher of the Observer.[76] Kushner's appointment was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law.[77] On January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion stating, \"The President may appoint relatives to his immediate staff of advisors.\"[78][79] Kushner was sworn in on January 22, 2017.[80] Kushner operated on a temporary security clearance for more than a year,[81][82] with access to classified information, until he was granted permanent access in May 2018.[83] On February 27, 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly downgraded Kushner's interim security clearance to \"secret\" status, along with other White House staffers working with interim security clearances.[84][85][86] He worked in the White House based on an interim security clearance[87] until May 2018, when he passed a comprehensive background investigation.[88] The New York Times reported in February 2019 that in May 2018 Trump ordered Kelly to grant Kushner a top-secret clearance, which Kelly contemporaneously documented in an internal memo. Trump had asserted in January 2019 that he had no role in directing officials to grant Kushner the clearance.[89] Kushner's office is physically the closest to the Oval Office.[90]\nTrump put Kushner in charge of brokering peace in Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, as well as making deals with foreign countries, although in what way he is in charge is unclear.[91][92][93] On August 24, 2017, Kushner traveled to Israel to talk to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu[94] (with whom Kushner has longstanding personal links and family ties, causing Palestinians to distrust him[95][96]). He then traveled to Palestine to meet President Mahmoud Abbas in an attempt to restart a peace process in the Middle East.[94]\nFurthermore, after Donald Trump became President-elect, Kushner and his wife met with Japanese Prime Minister and other Japanese officials, while his wife was conducting a licensing deal between her namesake clothing brand and a Japanese government-owned company.[97] His wife sat in on a meeting between her father, then-president-elect Donald Trump, and Japan's prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.[98]\nIn late March 2017, Jared Kushner was also given the new role of leading the \"White House Office of American Innovation\",[99][100] where Kushner reportedly has been focusing on improving governmental efforts with regard to Veterans Affairs, information-technology contracting, and the opioid crisis.[101] Kushner was involved in the sale of $100+ billion of arms to Saudi Arabia, and during a meeting with Saudi officials at the White House, he called Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson to ask for a lower price on a radar system to detect ballistic missiles.[102]\nKushner's business activities in China have drawn scrutiny for mixing government with business.[103][104][105]  Kushner's investments in real estate and financial services have also drawn controversy for conflicts of interest.[106][107] In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that he had failed to disclose all required financial information in his security clearance applications, including that he owes $1 billion in loans.[33][108]\nAbbe Lowell, the lawyer of Kushner, in a statement admitted that Kushner used private e-mail for official White House business. No classified or privileged information was used on this account. Kushner's father-in-law repeatedly criticized his opponent Hillary Clinton for her personal e-mail usage in her role as Secretary of State.[109]\n\nIn an HBO/Axios interview released in June 2019, Kushner denied that President Trump was a racist. When asked whether birther conspiracy theories about President Obama (which Trump pushed extensively for a number of years) were racist, Kushner did not answer, saying instead twice, \"Look, I wasn\u2019t really involved in that.\"[110][111] In the interview, Kushner spoke about how great the United States was for accepting his grandparents as refugees, \"It's a great reminder of how great this country is.\"[111] In the same interview, he defended the Trump administration's decision to drastically reduce the number of refugees accepted by the United States (the lowest level in 40 years).[112] Kushner helped to spearhead creation of the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act (FIRST STEP ACT, H.R. 5682) and its endorsement by the House Judiciary Committee on May 9, 2018.[113][114][115]\nKushner's contacts with Russian officials have come under scrutiny as part of the larger federal investigation into Russian interference in the election.[116] Kushner has said he had four meetings with Russians during the 2016 campaign and presidential transition, and that none of those Russian contacts were improper.[117]\nIn June 2016, an agent of Emin Agalarov reportedly offered Donald Trump Jr., Kushner's brother-in-law, compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government if he met with a lawyer connected to the Kremlin.[118] A meeting took place on June 9, 2016, and included Kushner, Trump Jr., and Paul Manafort, who was then chairman of the presidential campaign, who met with Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower.[119] According to Rinat Akhmetshin, who was also present at the meeting, Veselnitskaya claimed to have evidence of \"violations of Russian law by a Democratic donor\", and that the \"Russian lawyer described her findings at the meeting and left a document about them with Trump Jr. and the others\".[120] The Democratic National Committee cyber attacks were revealed later that week.[118]\nBetween April and November 2016, Kushner had two undisclosed phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak.[121] (In May 2017, Kushner's attorney Jamie Gorelick told Reuters that Kushner had participated in \"thousands of calls in this time period\" and did not recall any with Kislyak.[121]) In December 2016, Kushner met with Kislyak.[122] That month, U.S. intelligence officials who were monitoring Kislyak reportedly overheard him relaying to Moscow a request from Kushner to establish a \"secret and secure communications channel\" with the Kremlin using Russian diplomatic facilities. Kislyak reportedly was \"taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate \u2013 a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team\".[123][124]\nAlso in December 2016, Kushner met with Sergey N. Gorkov, a trained Russian spy who then headed Vnesheconombank (VEB), a Russian state-owned bank.[122][125][126] Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Kushner met with Gorkov briefly as part of his role in the transition, and as a diplomatic conduit to the State Department.[127] However, VEB has stated that Gorkov met with Kushner on a private matter concerning his family's real estate corporation, Kushner Companies, even though VEB has been under international sanctions since July 2014.[128]\nIn July 2017, Kushner appeared before both the House and Senate intelligence committees in closed session as part of their investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.[129] He also released a public statement.[130] In October 2017 the Senate Judiciary Committee requested numerous documents from Kushner. Kushner's attorneys gave the committee many documents on November 3, but the committee followed up on November 16 with a request for many additional documents it said had not been produced.[131]\nIn early November 2017, Kushner was interviewed by investigators from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office. Reportedly the interview focused on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.[132] On December 1, Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI, as part of a plea bargain. Bloomberg reported that Kushner is most likely the \"senior member of the Trump transition team,\" mentioned in Flynn's plea documents, who is said to have ordered Flynn to contact Russia.[133]\nMueller is investigating meetings between Trump associates including  Kushner and George Nader, an emissary representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. In August 2016,  Nader offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[134] In December 2016, Nader attended a New York meeting between the United Arab Emirates officials and Kushner, Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon.[135] Mueller is also investigating Kushner's possible ties to Qatar, Israel and China.[136]\nThe transcript of Kushner's interview with FBI investigators was not publicly released in January 2020 as ordered by a federal judge, as the Justice Department stated it required a security review by an unnamed intelligence agency.[137] The transcript was released on February 3, redacted nearly in its entirety.[138][139]\nOn January 18, 2017, Kushner requested Top Secret security clearance,[122] using \"Standard Form 86 (SF86): Questionnaire for National Security Positions\".[140][141]\nThe request omitted dozens of pertinent contacts with foreign officials, including the meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov.[122] Failure to disclose pertinent contacts can cause security clearances to be declined or revoked, and an intentional failure to disclose can result in imprisonment.[142] Kushner's lawyers said that the omissions were \"an oversight\",[143] and that \"a member of [Kushner's] staff had prematurely hit the 'send' button\" before the form was completed.[140]\nBy July 2017, Kushner had resubmitted his SF86, this time disclosing contacts with foreign nationals.[142] This was the first time that government officials were made aware of the June 2016 Trump campaign\u2013Russian meeting and Kushner's role in it.[142]\nOn September 15, 2017, Carl Kline, the director of the personnel security office within the Executive Office of President Trump, recorded Kushner as having an interim Top Secret/SCI security clearance.[89] Kushner and his wife were among at least 48 officials granted interim clearance giving them access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI): detailed accounts of intelligence sources and methods.[144][145]\nIn February 2018, all White House staff holding interim Top Secret/SCI security clearances, including Kushner, were downgraded to Secret clearances, and Trump said that he would not intervene to grant Kushner a permanent security clearance.[146] That day, White House sources said that part of the reason Kushner had not yet been granted permanent security clearance was that he was under investigation by Mueller.[147]\nOn May 23, 2018, Kushner received permanent Top Secret security clearance.[148][149]\nIn January 2019, Trump told the New York Times that he had not intervened to grant Kushner's security clearances.[89][150] On February 8, 2019, Kushner's wife Ivanka also denied that Trump had intervened to grant her or Kushner's security clearances.[150][151][152] However, on February 28, 2019, CNN (citing three anonymous sources) and The New York Times (citing four anonymous sources) reported that Trump had intervened to order the granting of those clearances.[89][150][153] Reportedly, this is the first time a U.S. President has intervened in such a way.[147]\nKushner has a younger brother, Joshua, and two sisters, Dara and Nicole.[154] He married Ivanka Trump in a Jewish ceremony on October 25, 2009. They had met in 2005 through mutual friends.[155][156][157] Kushner and his wife (who converted to Judaism in 2009[158]) are Modern Orthodox Jews, keep a kosher home, and observe the Jewish Shabbat.[159][160][161] They have three children, a daughter born in July 2011[162] and two sons born in October 2013[163] and March 2016.[164] In 2017, federal disclosures suggested Kushner and his wife had assets worth at least $240 million, and as much as $740 million.[106][165] They also have an art collection, estimated to be worth millions that was not mentioned in the financial disclosures initially,[166] and enjoy visiting art studios.[167] The United States Office of Government Ethics has said that the updated disclosures comply with the regulations and laws.[168]  When asked about his father-in-law President Donald Trump, Kushner told CNN's Van Jones: \"He's a black swan. He's been a black swan all his life.\"[169][ambiguous]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nStephanie McMahon Levesque[8][9] (born Stephanie Marie McMahon; September 24, 1976),[5][unreliable source?] is an American businesswoman and professional wrestling personality. She is the chief brand officer (CBO) of WWE and appears as an on-screen authority figure and occasional wrestler on both the Raw and SmackDown brands. A fourth generation wrestling promoter as a member of the McMahon family, she has worked for WWE since she was a young girl (modeling T-shirts and other merchandise for various WWE catalogs) working her way up to receptionist, then in various front office jobs up to and including her current CBO position. She is the great-granddaughter of Roderick \"Jess\" McMahon, granddaughter of Vincent J. McMahon, daughter of WWE Chairman and CEO Vincent K. McMahon and retired WWE CEO and former Administrator of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, the younger sister of WWE part-owner/wrestler Shane McMahon, and wife of WWE executive/wrestler Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque. McMahon began appearing regularly on-air for WWE (then WWF as the World Wrestling Federation) in 1999 as a part of a storyline with The Undertaker. After a brief on-screen relationship with Test, she was engaged to Triple H\u2014whom she married both on-screen and later in real life\u2014which resulted in The McMahon-Helmsley Faction storyline. She has held the WWF Women's Championship once. In 2001, she was the on-screen owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling during The Invasion. The following year, she was the SmackDown General Manager, but stopped appearing regularly on television after an \"I Quit\" match with her father Vince McMahon. After making only sporadic appearances for several years, McMahon began appearing regularly on Raw in 2008 as the Raw brand general manager before disappearing once again. By mid-2013, McMahon returned to regular on-air appearances in the WWE, this time under the gimmick of an unctuous, judgmental, bullying owner along with on-screen chief operating officer, her husband, Triple H. From 2013 to 2016, they acted as a power couple known as The Authority, making what were often shady decrees while claiming only to be concerned for \"what's best for business,\" all the while romanticizing each other in the process with public displays of affection. The Authority would later expand into a stable, with its co-leaders being Triple H and herself. Stephanie Marie McMahon was born on September 24, 1976 in Hartford, Connecticut to Linda and Vince McMahon.[10] She has one brother, Shane McMahon. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. There, she attended the selective Greenwich Country Day School, throughout her elementary school years. At the age of 13, McMahon appeared in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) merchandise catalogs, modeling T-shirts and hats.[11] After graduating from Greenwich High School in 1994, she attended Boston University and in 1998 earned a degree in Communications.[12] After graduating in 1998, she began working for the WWF full-time.[13] McMahon entered the World Wrestling Federation (WWF/E) as a model and for the WWF's sales and merchandise department, but started her WWF business career as an Account Executive for the WWF offices in New York.[8][14] In her early years with the company, she did reception work, creative design, television production, and acted as a ring performer.[15] After spending time as the director of creative writing, a job she had by 2002,[15] she was promoted to Senior Vice President of Creative Writing in 2006. McMahon was promoted to executive vice president of Creative in 2007. She was responsible for overseeing the creative process (storylines) for all television and pay-per-view programming. She oversaw all aspects of talent management and branding, live event booking and marketing, and all social and digital media properties.[8] As Executive vice-president of Creative, McMahon was able to spearhead the upbringing of the WWE app, which has been downloaded over 20 million times. She was also able to launch a huge partnership with the USO metropolitan Washington, the social media company Tout, and was able to partner with Yahoo to bring WWE content.[16] Stephanie also led WWE's Creative coalition for their Anti Bullying Campaigns. On December 4, 2013 WWE announced the promotion of McMahon to chief brand officer, where she will lead efforts to further enhance WWE's brand reputation among key constituents including advertisers, media, business partners, and investors. She will also serve as the lead ambassador of WWE and work with business units to support key growth initiatives. She will also lead WWE's targeted youth and moms marketing programs. McMahon's new position enabled her to spearhead the continued partnership with General Mills' Totino's brand. On February 5, 2014, McMahon along with CMO and CRO Michelle Wilson announced a partnership between WWE and KaBOOM! to build a playground for WWE's annual WrestleMania week in Louisiana. McMahon earned a combined salary of over $775,000 between her corporate role and as an on-screen talent in 2013. She also owns over $77 million in WWE stock.[17] On April 15, 2014 during WWE's annual Business Partners Summit, McMahon confirmed that a new WWE logo would debut the night after WWE SummerSlam, although it was already showing up on WWE products like the WWE Network and NXT. On August 5, at the Needham fireside conference, McMahon alongside with her husband Triple H, and WWE Chief strategy and financial officer George Barrios, discussed the Creative side of WWE, the WWE Network, and the difference between WWE and UFC.[18] In early 1999, at the suggestion of WWF writer Vince Russo[19] McMahon debuted as the innocent and friendly daughter of Vince McMahon during an on-screen storyline involving Vince and The Undertaker.[20] The Undertaker stalked and abducted McMahon at the end of the April Backlash pay-per-view, which culminated in him almost marrying her in the middle of the ring the next night on Raw, before being rescued by Stone Cold Steve Austin.[21] McMahon then began an on-screen relationship with wrestler Test, which led to a rivalry between him and her older brother Shane.[22] After Test defeated Shane at SummerSlam in a \"Love Her Or Leave Her Match\",[23] McMahon and Test went on to team together in a match on September 20, 1999, with the couple defeating Jeff Jarrett and Debra.[24] The couple were eventually engaged, but during the in-ring ceremony, Triple H showed a video which revealed that he had drugged McMahon and taken her to Las Vegas, Nevada where they were married in a drive-through ceremony.[25][26] McMahon seemed to abhor Triple H at first, but at the inaugural Armageddon event, after Triple H defeated her father in a No Holds Barred Match, left with him after embracing. McMahon confronted Vince the next night on Raw and revealed the wedding was a planned event, which was a revenge plot against her father for the aforementioned kidnappings, thus turning her into a villainess.[26][27] In late 1999, with Vince McMahon absent as a result of injuries inflicted upon him by Triple H at the Armageddon pay-per-view, Triple H and McMahon became the on-screen owners of the WWF, a period known as the \"McMahon-Helmsley Era\" (slightly different from the modern era of \"The Authority\") and dominated by the McMahon-Helmsley Faction.[28] Triple H held the WWF Championship and McMahon held the WWF Women's Championship after defeating champion Jacqueline with the help of Tori and D-Generation X on the March 28 episode of SmackDown![29] McMahon successfully defended her title against Lita on SmackDown on June 6 and June 16.[30] McMahon reconciled with her father and brother at WrestleMania 2000 when they helped Triple H defend his title against The Rock, leaving Linda McMahon as the only fan-favorite in the McMahon family.[31] In mid-2000, a love triangle storyline began featuring McMahon, Triple H and Kurt Angle.[32] The storyline continued at Unforgiven when Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree following a low blow from McMahon, proving her loyalty to him.[33] McMahon later became Angle's manager and was in his corner when he defeated The Rock for the WWF Championship at No Mercy.[34] The alliance was short-lived, however, as after The Rock performed his Rock Bottom maneuver on McMahon at No Mercy, Triple H attacked Angle, considering it his fault that McMahon was hurt due to her managing Angle at the time.[35] On the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw, McMahon lost the WWF's Women's Championship to Lita despite the interferences from Angle and Triple H after special referee, The Rock, performed a spinebuster on McMahon.[36] The internal disputes between the McMahons led to Linda McMahon being in a comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who took the opportunity to have a public affair with Trish Stratus.[37][38] McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out.[39] Over the next few weeks, Vince made it clear that he favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus.[38] At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight.[38] During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.[37][38] McMahon later revealed that she had purchased Extreme Championship Wrestling and intended to bankrupt the WWF (in reality, the ownership of ECW assets at this time was highly disputed), along with her brother Shane, who had become the on-screen owner of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the two rosters merged to form a \"supergroup\" known as The Alliance.[22][40] Her team The Alliance consisting of her brother Shane, former WCW Champion Booker T., Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle and Steve Austin were defeated by Team WWF consisting of The Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Chris Jericho and The Rock at Survivor Series in a five-on-five, Winner Takes All elimination match.[41] The night after The Alliance was defeated, Shane and Stephanie were banished from WWF television.[42] McMahon returned in January 2002 when Triple H made a comeback as a fan-favorite, but the good couple began having problems, as McMahon began acting like a nagging and clingy wife.[26] As part of the storyline, the couple \"divorced\" after McMahon claimed to be pregnant in order to trick Triple H into renewing their marital vows.[43] Triple H later discovered that she was lying though and left her at the altar during the renewal ceremony.[44] As a result, after Triple H won the Royal Rumble, McMahon appointed herself as the special guest referee in a match between Kurt Angle and Triple H at No Way Out with Triple H's WrestleMania Undisputed WWF Championship shot on the line.[44] Though Angle won thanks to McMahon's biased officiating,[45] Triple H defeated him the next night to regain his title shot.[46] McMahon then aligned herself with former enemy, Chris Jericho.[22][46] Despite interference by McMahon, Jericho lost to Triple H at WrestleMania X8 on March 17.[47] On the March 25 episode of Raw, Jericho and McMahon lost to Triple H in a triple threat match for the Undisputed Championship, with the stipulation that, if McMahon was pinned, she would be forced to leave the WWF. In the match, McMahon came within a one count of becoming the first female WWE Champion in a pin on Jericho, but was ultimately pinned by Triple H.[48] On July 18, 2002, McMahon returned to the WWE (formerly WWF until a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund) as the general manager of SmackDown.[49] In contrast to her McMahon-Helmsley era villain character, McMahon became a fan favorite, as she began to favor fan favorite wrestlers at that time. She feuded with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown! at a Halloween party, McMahon and Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father underneath a mask.[50] McMahon was given credit for the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship.[51] She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to SmackDown!, which caused friction between herself and her father.[52] In the summer of 2003, Vince McMahon began to resent Stephanie's attempts to stop him from pursuing an affair with Sable.[53] In a controversial segment of SmackDown, John Cena requested that Stephanie rip Sable's top off and that he be allowed to slap Stephanie's buttocks; she agreed to it and he slapped her buttocks, after which she went backstage, fought Sable, and ripped Sable's top off briefly exposing Sable's breasts on air. The feud culminated in the controversial first ever \"Father\u2013Daughter 'I Quit' match\" at No Mercy.[54][55] McMahon was accompanied by her mother, the CEO of WWE Linda McMahon, and Sable accompanied Vince in their match.[54] McMahon lost when Linda, at ringside threw in a towel on her behalf because Vince would not release a choke he had on her with a lead pipe.[54] As a result of losing the match, McMahon disappeared from WWE television for two years. The match was made to write Stephanie out of storylines as she was marrying Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque that week.[56] McMahon returned as a villain once again on October 3, 2005 for Raw Homecoming, where she confronted Stone Cold Steve Austin and received a Stunner.[57] On October 10, 2005, she, along with her father and, in a surprise twist, her mother fired Raw announcer Jim Ross.[58] A visibly pregnant McMahon also returned on the March 6, 2006 episode of Raw, approaching Shawn Michaels backstage and claiming to have abdominal pains.[59] When Michaels left to get her some water, McMahon pulled out an unmarked substance out of her brassiere and poured it into his bottle of water.[59] This substance caused him to become groggy during his match against Shane later in the night, which he lost as a result.[59] McMahon also appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 1, 2006 and in a backstage vignette with her immediate family at WrestleMania 22.[60] McMahon returned during a backstage segment in April 2007 at WrestleMania 23, visiting her father before his \"Battle of the Billionaires\" match.[61] After her father returned to Raw after faking his own death,[62] McMahon publicly revealed that her father had an illegitimate child, who was among the WWE roster.[63] On the taped edition of Raw that aired September 3, 2007, McMahon, along with her mother Linda and her brother Shane, made several appearances to confront Mr. McMahon about the child, who was later revealed to be Hornswoggle, turning into a fan favorite.[64] On Raw's 15 Year Anniversary episode, she appeared along with Shane in a segment\u2014also involving her husband Triple H and Hornswoggle\u2014which ended with her kissing her real life husband Triple H, to humiliate her father on Raw.[65] After the severe injuries sustained by Vince on the June 23, three-hour edition of Raw, Shane appeared requesting for the Raw Superstars to stand together during what was a 'turbulent time'.[66][67] Shane's plea was ignored, and subsequently, for the next two weeks, McMahon and Shane urged the superstars to show solidarity.[68][69] The following week, Shane announced Mike Adamle as their choice to be the new Raw General Manager.[70] After Adamle stepped down as General Manager, McMahon soon became in charge of the brand and (reignited her feud) and had altercations with Chris Jericho in the following weeks, which involved her firing him (although he was later reinstated).[71] After her father Vince returned, the family began a feud with Randy Orton, who began the storyline by punting Vince in the head.[72] After a few weeks of feuding, Orton and his alliance, The Legacy, punted Shane in the head and performed an RKO on McMahon.[73] Following the attack, he was chased out of the ring by Triple H, her real-life husband.[73] The rivalry among Orton, the Legacy and the McMahons heated up when Orton attacked and kissed Stephanie. Triple H and the Legacy's rivalry continued at WrestleMania XXV, where Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Orton.[74] The following month, Orton won the championship at Backlash.[75] After Backlash, McMahon left Raw and took a hiatus from WWE television. McMahon appeared on the November 1 episode of Raw in a pre-taped segment, where she dreamt that Vince awoke from a coma after his doctor, played by actor and one-time WWE employee Freddie Prinze Jr., informed him that his wife Linda had invested millions in her campaign as she runs for senate.[5] Vince's heart rate elevated more and more as Prinze informed him on what was \"wrong\" with WWE since he went into a coma.[5] After beginning to feel better, Vince realizes that he has a serious case of \"the runs\", in which he gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom, in which he is covered in campaign signs, that block his backside.[5] McMahon suddenly wakes up from her dream and asks her husband, Triple H (off-screen and voice work only), if Vince was still in a coma, in which Triple H replies \"Yeah, he's in a coma. I'm pretty sure he's brain dead.\"; McMahon responds by saying \"Thank God,\" and then lays back down. McMahon made an appearance as a guest speaker at the WrestleMania XXVII Press Conference.[5] Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match.[5] Upon offering to shake his hand, Punk declined and insulted her: \"I would, but... I know where that hand's been.\"[5] The following night on Raw, McMahon appeared backstage with CM Punk and threatened him: \"...in the end, people always get what they deserve.\"[5] On July 23, 2012, McMahon made an appearance on the 1000th episode of Raw where she confronted and then slapped Paul Heyman to convince him to accept a match between Brock Lesnar and Triple H at SummerSlam.[5] On April 6, 2013, McMahon inducted former on-screen rival Trish Stratus into the WWE Hall of Fame.[76] On June 3, 2013, McMahon made an appearance to reveal her decision not to allow Triple H to compete that night.[77] On the June 17 episode of Raw, McMahon confronted new Divas Champion AJ Lee.[78] On the July 8 episode of Raw, McMahon fired Vickie Guerrero from the position of Raw Managing Supervisor when the WWE Universe voted \"Failed\" during Guerrero's job evaluation.[79] On the August 19 episode of Raw, McMahon turned heel when she interrupted Daniel Bryan and supported the actions of her husband at SummerSlam the previous night, telling Bryan that he wasn't suitable to be the face of the company. Later in the night McMahon stood beside Triple H and her father as they celebrated Randy Orton's WWE Championship Coronation, during which Daniel Bryan was attacked by The Shield and subsequently by Orton. In November 2013, McMahon signed a three-year performer's contract with the WWE, confirming her as a regular on its programming.[80] She and Triple H continued to rule the company as a controlling \"power couple\" dubbed The Authority. Swearing that their actions were \"best for business\", the pair would belittle and punish any talent that went against their ideology, and formed a particular vendetta against Daniel Bryan. McMahon was at ringside when Triple H lost to Bryan at WrestleMania XXX. In June 2014, as part of the ongoing storyline with Bryan, McMahon threatened to fire his wife Brie Bella if Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which forced Brie to quit before slapping McMahon in the face.[81] On the June 16 episode of Raw, Roman Reigns spiked the coffee Vickie Guerrero gave to McMahon, causing Stephanie to throw up on Vickie and leave with Triple H to the hospital. Vickie later gave Reigns a chance in the battle royal, which he would win.[82] On the June 23 episode of Raw, Vickie lost in a pudding match against McMahon with her job on the line, after interference by Alicia Fox, Layla and Rosa Mendes. Vickie ultimately lost the match and was fired; however, she got her retribution over McMahon by throwing her into the mud pool.[83] After Brie quit, McMahon put Brie's sister Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment.[84][85][86][87] Brie returned to television on the July 21 episode of Raw, appearing in the crowd leading to a confrontation between the two. McMahon was (kayfabe) arrested and charged with assault and battery, because she slapped Brie, who was not a (kayfabe) WWE employee[88] The following week, McMahon granted Brie her job back and a match at SummerSlam against her in order to get Brie to drop the lawsuit.[89] On the August 4 episode of Raw, after their contract signing, McMahon pedigreed both twins.[90] At SummerSlam, Nikki turned on Brie, allowing Stephanie to hit a pedigree on Brie having Stephanie win her first pay per view match in over 10 years.[91] On the October 27 episode of Raw, after John Cena, the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join the Authority, Triple H announced a Traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing the Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, the Authority will be ousted from power. During the match, Triple H tried to get the last member of Team Cena, Dolph Ziggler, eliminated by attacking two referees and placing Seth Rollins (who was also the final member of Team Authority) on top of Ziggler and calling crooked referee Scott Armstrong into the ring to make the count; however, the debuting Sting came out and attacked Armstrong and Triple H, giving Team Cena the win and thus disbanding The Authority. Stephanie and Triple H appeared on the episode of Raw after Survivor Series stating that without them the company would be driven to the ground. They were then escorted out of the arena by the returning Daniel Bryan and only to be insulted by Mr.McMahon for letting him down and the McMahon family before exiting the arena. On the December 29 episode of Raw, The Authority was brought back in power by John Cena, and she and her husband entered and stepped on the entrance ramp celebrating their return with a glass of champagne and a kiss.[92] Stephanie and Triple H then proceeded to fire Erick Rowan, Ryback and Dolph Ziggler. On the July 13, 2015 episode of Raw, Stephanie interrupted Team Bella (The Bella Twins and Alicia Fox) to introduce Becky Lynch, Charlotte, and then-NXT Women's Champion Sasha Banks, calling for a \"revolution\" in the WWE Divas division. While Lynch and Charlotte allied with Paige, Banks would ally with Tamina and Naomi, leading to a brawl between the three teams.[93] On the February 22, 2016 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon presented the \"Vincent J. McMahon Legacy of Excellence\" award to Stephanie. Before she could start her acceptance speech, Shane McMahon returned for the first time since 2009 and demanded to gain control of Raw, claiming The Authority was running the company to the ground. Mr. McMahon accepted the offer, only if he won one more match. Shane accepted, and Mr. McMahon announced he would wrestle at WrestleMania 32 against The Undertaker inside Hell in a Cell. On the post-WrestleMania episode of Raw on April 4, Mr. McMahon opened the show to announce that his returning son, Shane, would run Raw for one night only. However, Shane continued to run Raw due to \"overwhelming fan support\" until the April 25 episode of Raw, when Stephanie returned to announce that Mr. McMahon would decide who'd permanently control Raw at Payback. Mr. McMahon announced that both Stephanie and Shane would run Raw together on a permanent basis, thus disbanding The Authority. On the July 11 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon announced Stephanie as the commissioner of the Raw brand, while Shane was named commissioner of SmackDown in order for them to compete against each other in the upcoming reestablished brand extension. The following week on Raw, Stephanie appointed Mick Foley as the Raw General Manager. The next week on Raw, Stephanie and Mick Foley announced the WWE Universal Championship would be the main championship on Raw. On the October 11 episode of SmackDown, Commissioner Shane McMahon and General Manager Daniel Bryan challenged Raw to three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches \u2013 involving each brand's best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively. The following week on Raw, Raw Commissioner Stephanie accepted the challenge. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Stephanie invited both Shane and Bryan to appear on the following week's Raw to address the interpromotional matches, which Shane and Bryan accepted. During this meeting, each commissioner and general manager touted the reasons for why their respective brand was better and eventually called out their respective male teams. In the ensuing battle, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins of Team Raw stood tall at the end. At Survivor Series, Team SmackDown defeated Team Raw, On the March 20 episode of Raw, Foley was fired as Raw General Manager for his actions. In April, Stephanie was written out of the storyline after being pushed accidentally through a table at WrestleMania 33 by Triple H, and did not appear on WWE TV for many months. However, McMahon made a one-off appearance after Kevin Owens assaulted her father on the September 12 edition of SmackDown.[94] McMahon returned to Raw on the October 30, 2017 episode, confronting Raw General Manager Kurt Angle regarding Shane and the Smackdown roster's attack on the Raw roster at the end of the previous week's Raw, naming him team captain for Raw at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, warning him that if Raw is not victorious over Smackdown at the pay-per-view, she was considering dismissing him from being Raw General Manager. On the December 18 episode of Raw, after a six-woman tag team match between the team of Sasha Banks, Bayley, and Mickie James and Absolution (Paige, Mandy Rose, and Sonya Deville) ended in disqualification and a brawl ensued with the rest of the Raw women's roster (Alicia Fox, Asuka, Nia Jax, Dana Brooke, and Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss), Raw Commissioner Stephanie came out and the brawl stopped. Stephanie recapped the leaps that women's wrestling had taken the past few years, going from a revolution to an evolution of women's wrestling, including the first-ever women's Hell in a Cell match, the first-ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match, and women main eventing Raw and SmackDown. She then announced the first-ever women's Royal Rumble match for the 2018 Royal Rumble with the winner receiving a match at WrestleMania 34 for either the Raw Women's Championship or SmackDown Women's Championship. Upon the signing of Ronda Rousey, McMahon embarked on a feud with her, leading to mixed tag-team match at WrestleMania 34 against Rousey and Kurt Angle with her husband, Triple H as her partner. This was McMahon's first match since SummerSlam (2014) and her first ever WrestleMania match. At the event, her team was defeated when she tapped out to Rousey's armbar.[95] Following this loss, Stephanie would begin making only sporadic appearances on TV. On the July 23 episode of Raw, McMahon returned to announce a match between Kevin Owens and Braun Strowman at the August 19 SummerSlam Pay Per View.

She is the chief brand officer (CBO) of WWE and appears as an on-screen authority figure and occasional wrestler on both the Raw and SmackDown brands.\nA fourth generation wrestling promoter as a member of the McMahon family, she has worked for WWE since she was a young girl (modeling T-shirts and other merchandise for various WWE catalogs) working her way up to receptionist, then in various front office jobs up to and including her current CBO position. She is the great-granddaughter of Roderick \"Jess\" McMahon, granddaughter of Vincent J. McMahon, daughter of WWE Chairman and CEO Vincent K. McMahon and retired WWE CEO and former Administrator of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, the younger sister of WWE part-owner/wrestler Shane McMahon, and wife of WWE executive/wrestler Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque.\nMcMahon began appearing regularly on-air for WWE (then WWF as the World Wrestling Federation) in 1999 as a part of a storyline with The Undertaker. After a brief on-screen relationship with Test, she was engaged to Triple H\u2014whom she married both on-screen and later in real life\u2014which resulted in The McMahon-Helmsley Faction storyline. She has held the WWF Women's Championship once. In 2001, she was the on-screen owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling during The Invasion. The following year, she was the SmackDown General Manager, but stopped appearing regularly on television after an \"I Quit\" match with her father Vince McMahon.\nAfter making only sporadic appearances for several years, McMahon began appearing regularly on Raw in 2008 as the Raw brand general manager before disappearing once again. By mid-2013, McMahon returned to regular on-air appearances in the WWE, this time under the gimmick of an unctuous, judgmental, bullying owner along with on-screen chief operating officer, her husband, Triple H. From 2013 to 2016, they acted as a power couple known as The Authority, making what were often shady decrees while claiming only to be concerned for \"what's best for business,\" all the while romanticizing each other in the process with public displays of affection. The Authority would later expand into a stable, with its co-leaders being Triple H and herself.\nStephanie Marie McMahon was born on September 24, 1976 in Hartford, Connecticut to Linda and Vince McMahon.[10] She has one brother, Shane McMahon. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. There, she attended the selective Greenwich Country Day School, throughout her elementary school years. At the age of 13, McMahon appeared in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) merchandise catalogs, modeling T-shirts and hats.[11] After graduating from Greenwich High School in 1994, she attended Boston University and in 1998 earned a degree in Communications.[12] After graduating in 1998, she began working for the WWF full-time.[13]\nMcMahon entered the World Wrestling Federation (WWF/E) as a model and  for the WWF's sales and merchandise department, but started her WWF business career as an Account Executive for the WWF offices in New York.[8][14] In her early years with the company, she did reception work, creative design, television production, and acted as a ring performer.[15] After spending time as the director of creative writing, a job she had by 2002,[15] she was promoted to Senior Vice President of Creative Writing in 2006.\nMcMahon was promoted to executive vice president of Creative in 2007. She was responsible for overseeing the creative process (storylines) for all television and pay-per-view programming. She oversaw all aspects of talent management and branding, live event booking and marketing, and all social and digital media properties.[8]\nAs Executive vice-president of Creative, McMahon was able to spearhead the upbringing of the WWE app, which has been downloaded over 20 million times. She was also able to launch a huge partnership with the USO metropolitan Washington, the social media company Tout, and was able to partner with Yahoo to bring WWE content.[16] Stephanie also led WWE's Creative coalition for their Anti Bullying Campaigns.\nOn December 4, 2013 WWE announced the promotion of McMahon to chief brand officer, where she will lead efforts to further enhance WWE's brand reputation among key constituents including advertisers, media, business partners, and investors. She will also serve as the lead ambassador of WWE and work with business units to support key growth initiatives. She will also lead WWE's targeted youth and moms marketing programs.\nMcMahon's new position enabled her to spearhead the continued partnership with General Mills' Totino's brand.\nOn February 5, 2014, McMahon along with CMO and CRO Michelle Wilson announced a partnership between WWE and KaBOOM! to build a playground for WWE's annual WrestleMania week in Louisiana. McMahon earned a combined salary of over $775,000 between her corporate role and as an on-screen talent in 2013. She also owns over $77 million in WWE stock.[17]\nOn April 15, 2014 during WWE's annual Business Partners Summit, McMahon confirmed that a new WWE logo would debut the night after WWE SummerSlam, although it was already showing up on WWE products like the WWE Network and NXT.\nOn August 5, at the Needham fireside conference, McMahon alongside with her husband Triple H, and WWE Chief strategy and financial officer George Barrios, discussed the Creative side of WWE, the WWE Network, and the difference between WWE and UFC.[18]\nIn early 1999, at the suggestion of WWF writer Vince Russo[19] McMahon debuted as the innocent and friendly daughter of Vince McMahon during an on-screen storyline involving Vince and The Undertaker.[20] The Undertaker stalked and abducted McMahon at the end of the April Backlash pay-per-view, which culminated in him almost marrying her in the middle of the ring the next night on Raw, before being rescued by Stone Cold Steve Austin.[21]\nMcMahon then began an on-screen relationship with wrestler Test, which led to a rivalry between him and her older brother Shane.[22] After Test defeated Shane at SummerSlam in a \"Love Her Or Leave Her Match\",[23] McMahon and Test went on to team together in a match on September 20, 1999, with the couple defeating Jeff Jarrett and Debra.[24] The couple were eventually engaged, but during the in-ring ceremony, Triple H showed a video which revealed that he had drugged McMahon and taken her to Las Vegas, Nevada where they were married in a drive-through ceremony.[25][26] McMahon seemed to abhor Triple H at first, but at the inaugural Armageddon event, after Triple H defeated her father in a No Holds Barred Match, left with him after embracing. McMahon confronted Vince the next night on Raw and revealed the wedding was a planned event, which was a revenge plot against her father for the aforementioned kidnappings, thus turning her into a villainess.[26][27]\nIn late 1999, with Vince McMahon absent as a result of injuries inflicted upon him by Triple H at the Armageddon pay-per-view, Triple H and McMahon became the on-screen owners of the WWF, a period known as the \"McMahon-Helmsley Era\" (slightly different from the modern era of \"The Authority\") and dominated by the McMahon-Helmsley Faction.[28] Triple H held the WWF Championship and McMahon held the WWF Women's Championship after defeating champion Jacqueline with the help of Tori and D-Generation X on the March 28 episode of SmackDown![29] McMahon successfully defended her title against Lita on SmackDown on June 6 and June 16.[30] McMahon reconciled with her father and brother at WrestleMania 2000 when they helped Triple H defend his title against The Rock, leaving Linda McMahon as the only fan-favorite in the McMahon family.[31]\nIn mid-2000, a love triangle storyline began featuring McMahon, Triple H and Kurt Angle.[32] The storyline continued at Unforgiven when Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree following a low blow from McMahon, proving her loyalty to him.[33] McMahon later became Angle's manager and was in his corner when he defeated The Rock for the WWF Championship at No Mercy.[34] The alliance was short-lived, however, as after The Rock performed his Rock Bottom maneuver on McMahon at No Mercy, Triple H attacked Angle, considering it his fault that McMahon was hurt due to her managing Angle at the time.[35] On the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw, McMahon lost the WWF's Women's Championship to Lita despite the interferences from Angle and Triple H after special referee, The Rock, performed a spinebuster on McMahon.[36]\nThe internal disputes between the McMahons led to Linda McMahon being in a comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who took the opportunity to have a public affair with Trish Stratus.[37][38] McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out.[39] Over the next few weeks, Vince made it clear that he favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus.[38] At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight.[38] During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.[37][38]\nMcMahon later revealed that she had purchased Extreme Championship Wrestling and intended to bankrupt the WWF (in reality, the ownership of ECW assets at this time was highly disputed), along with her brother Shane, who had become the on-screen owner of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the two rosters merged to form a \"supergroup\" known as The Alliance.[22][40]\nHer team The Alliance consisting of her brother Shane, former WCW Champion Booker T., Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle and Steve Austin were defeated by Team WWF consisting of The Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Chris Jericho and The Rock at Survivor Series in a five-on-five, Winner Takes All elimination match.[41] The night after The Alliance was defeated, Shane and Stephanie were banished from WWF television.[42] McMahon returned in January 2002 when Triple H made a comeback as a fan-favorite, but the good couple began having problems, as McMahon began acting like a nagging and clingy wife.[26]\nAs part of the storyline, the couple \"divorced\" after McMahon claimed to be pregnant in order to trick Triple H into renewing their marital vows.[43] Triple H later discovered that she was lying though and left her at the altar during the renewal ceremony.[44] As a result, after Triple H won the Royal Rumble, McMahon appointed herself as the special guest referee in a match between Kurt Angle and Triple H at No Way Out with Triple H's WrestleMania Undisputed WWF Championship shot on the line.[44] Though Angle won thanks to McMahon's biased officiating,[45] Triple H defeated him the next night to regain his title shot.[46] McMahon then aligned herself with former enemy, Chris Jericho.[22][46] Despite interference by McMahon, Jericho lost to Triple H at WrestleMania X8 on March 17.[47] On the March 25 episode of Raw, Jericho and McMahon lost to Triple H in a triple threat match for the Undisputed Championship, with the stipulation that, if McMahon was pinned, she would be forced to leave the WWF. In the match, McMahon came within a one count of becoming the first female WWE Champion in a pin on Jericho, but was ultimately pinned by Triple H.[48]\nOn July 18, 2002, McMahon returned to the WWE (formerly WWF until a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund) as the general manager of SmackDown.[49] In contrast to her McMahon-Helmsley era villain character, McMahon became a fan favorite, as she began to favor fan favorite wrestlers at that time. She feuded with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown! at a Halloween party, McMahon and Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father underneath a mask.[50] McMahon was given credit for the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship.[51] She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to SmackDown!, which caused friction between herself and her father.[52]\nIn the summer of 2003, Vince McMahon began to resent Stephanie's attempts to stop him from pursuing an affair with Sable.[53] In a controversial segment of SmackDown, John Cena requested that Stephanie rip Sable's top off and that he be allowed to slap Stephanie's buttocks; she agreed to it and he slapped her buttocks, after which she went backstage, fought Sable, and ripped Sable's top off briefly exposing Sable's breasts on air.
