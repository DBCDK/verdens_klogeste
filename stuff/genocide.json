                "text": "no title\n\nAmal Clooney (n\u00e9e Alamuddin; Arabic: \u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u200e; born 3 February 1978)[1] is a Lebanese-British barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, specialising in international law and human rights.[2] Her clients include Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, in his fight against extradition;[3] the former prime minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko;[4] Egyptian-Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy;[5] and Nobel Prize laureate Nadia Murad.[6] In 2019, Clooney was appointed the special envoy on media freedom by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office.[7] Amal Alamuddin was born in Beirut, Lebanon. Her first name is derived from Arabic \u0623\u0645\u0644 \u02beamal, meaning \"hope\".[8] Her family left Lebanon when she was two years old, during the Lebanese Civil War, and settled in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.[9] Her father, Ramzi Alamuddin, a Lebanese Druze from Baakline (a village in the Chouf district),[10] received his MBA degree at the American University of Beirut. He returned to Lebanon in 1991.[11][12] Her mother, Bariaa (n\u00e9e Miknass), from a family of Sunni Muslims[13][10] from Tripoli in Northern Lebanon,[13][10] is a political journalist[14] and foreign editor of the Pan-Arab newspaper al-Hayat and a founder of the public relations company International Communication Experts, which is part of a larger company that specialises in celebrity guest bookings, publicity photography, and event promotion.[15] Alamuddin has three siblings: one sister and two half-brothers,[15] from her father's first marriage.[16] Alamuddin attended Dr Challoner's High School, a girls' grammar school located in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire. She then studied at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she received an Exhibition[17] and the Shrigley Award.[18] In 2000, Clooney graduated with a BA degree in Jurisprudence (Oxford's equivalent to the LLB).[19] The following year, in 2001, she entered New York University School of Law to study for the LLM degree. She received the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law.[20][21] For one semester while at NYU, she worked in the office of Sonia Sotomayor, then a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.[22] Clooney is qualified to practice as a lawyer in the United States and the United Kingdom. She was admitted to the bar in New York in 2002, and in England and Wales in 2010. She has also practised at international courts in The Hague including the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.[20] Alamuddin worked at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York City, for three years as part of the Criminal Defense and Investigations Group, where her clients included Enron and Arthur Andersen.[18][20] In 2004, she completed a judicial clerkship at the International Court of Justice. She clerked under Judge Vladlen S. Vereshchetin from Russia, Judge Nabil Elaraby from Egypt,[23][24] and ad hoc Judge Sir Franklin Berman from the United Kingdom. She was subsequently based in The Hague working in the Office of the Prosecutor at the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon and at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.[25] Alamuddin returned to Britain in 2010,[26] where she became a barrister in London (Bar of England & Wales, Inner Temple) at Doughty Street Chambers.[18] In 2013 Clooney was appointed to a number of United Nations commissions, including as adviser to Special Envoy Kofi Annan on Syria and as Counsel to the 2013 Drone Inquiry by UN human rights rapporteur Ben Emmerson QC into the use of drones in counter-terrorism operations.[21][27] Alamuddin had been involved in high-profile cases representing the state of Cambodia, the former Libyan intelligence chief Abdallah Al Senussi, Yulia Tymoshenko[28] and Julian Assange, and was an adviser to the King of Bahrain in connection with the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry headed by Professor M. Cherif Bassiouni.[20] For the spring 2015 and 2016 academic semesters, Clooney was a visiting faculty member and a senior fellow with Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute.[29][30] She was a co-professor with Sarah H. Cleveland in Cleveland's course on human rights and taught a class on human rights litigation to students in the school's Human Rights Clinic.[31][32] For the spring 2018 semester, Clooney taught at Columbia Law School, again as a co-professor with Sarah H. Cleveland on a core class on human rights.[33] Clooney has also lectured students on international criminal law at the Law School of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, The New School in New York City, The Hague Academy of International Law, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.[20] As of 2011[update], Alamuddin was assisting the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the arbitration between Merck Sharp and Dohme and the Republic of Ecuador.[34] Starting in 2014, Clooney represented Canadian Al Jazeera English journalist Mohamed Fahmy who, along with other journalists, was being held in Egypt.[35][36][37][38] He was eventually sentenced to three years in prison and lost a retrial in August 2015 before finally being pardoned by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.[39][40] In August 2014, Clooney declined a UN commission to look into possible violations of the rules of war in Gaza during the Gaza war of 2014.[41] In October 2014, Clooney was hired in an attempt to repatriate the ancient Greek sculptures the Elgin Marbles.[42][43] In May 2015, Greece decided to stop legal proceedings to recover the sculptures and dismissed her as their brief.[44] In January 2015, Clooney began work on the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.[45] She is representing Armenia on behalf of Doughty Street Chambers along with Geoffrey Robertson QC.[46] She said Turkey's stance was hypocritical \"because of its disgraceful record on freedom of expression\", including prosecutions of Turkish-Armenians who campaigned for the 1915 massacres to be called a genocide.[45] She is representing Armenia in the case against Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek,[47][48] whose 2007 conviction for genocide denial and racial discrimination was overturned in Perin\u00e7ek v. Switzerland (2013).[45] A \"minor internet frenzy\" resulted from her bon mot prior to the 28 January 2015 hearing. In response to a journalist pestering her over what designer gown she would be wearing in court, she replied \"Ede & Ravenscroft\"\u00a0\u2013 the tailors who make her court robes.[49][50] On 8 March 2015, Clooney filed a case against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines before the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, a body under the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, for the continued detention of former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.[51] Arroyo was a sitting Pampanga congresswoman at the time. On 2 October, The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention later released its opinion that the detention of former President Arroyo \"violates international law\" and is \"arbitrary on a number of grounds\".[52] On 7 April 2015, it was announced that Clooney would be part of the legal team defending Mohamed Nasheed, former President of the Maldives, in his ongoing arbitrary detention.[53] Nasheed was sentenced to 13 years in jail in March 2015 following what was characterized as a politically motivated trial.[54] Amnesty International described his sentencing as a \"travesty of justice\".[55][56] Prior to visiting the Maldives, the local co-counsel working on the case was stabbed in the head, an indication of the danger and instability in the country.[57] In January 2016, Clooney gave a series of interviews about the UN-condemned trial and imprisonment of Nasheed and put forth efforts to support imposing sanctions on the Maldives.[58][59] According to The Economist, she has \"helped strengthen the backing of Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, for the cause of Maldivian democracy.\"[60] In June 2015, Clooney began work on the recently re-opened Hooded Men case[61] brought by the Irish government against the British government in the European Court of Human Rights.[62][63] Clooney worked with Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Charles Flanagan[citation needed] on the case, which concerned policies used by UK Prime Minister Edward Heath (1970\u20131974) in Operation Demetrius that included the illegal interrogation methods known as five techniques.[64] In September 2018, the court rejected the final appeal in the case.[65] Clooney is part of the legal team representing Louis Olivier Bancoult and Chagos islanders on their claim[66] that they had been forced off their island, Diego Garcia, in 1971 by the UK government to make way for a U.S. military base.[67] In 2016, it was announced that Clooney would represent Azerbaijani journalist Khadija Ismayilova at the European Court of Human Rights. Ismayilova's investigative work had resulted in her imprisonment.[68] Following the trial, Ismayilova was released from prison and had her sentence reduced to a suspended three-and-a-half-year term.[69] In September 2016, Clooney spoke\u00a0\u2013 for the first time at the United Nations\u00a0\u2013 before the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to discuss the decision she made in June 2016[70] to represent Nadia Murad as a client in legal action against ISIL commanders.[71][72][73] Clooney characterised the genocide, rape, and trafficking as a \"bureaucracy of evil on an industrial scale\" by ISIL, describing a slave market existing both online, on Facebook and in the Middle East that is still active today.[74] Clooney, along with Ara Darzi, was involved in securing the release of two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, from Myanmar on 7 May 2019.[75] On 25 February 2014, the UK Attorney General's Office appointed Clooney for the period 2014 to 2019 to the C Panel of the Public International Law Panel of Counsel.[76][77] In May 2014, Clooney was a signatory of UNICEF UK and Jemima Khan's open letter that called for \"action from UK Government to protect women and children\".[78] On 2 January 2015, it was reported by The Guardian that before Clooney was involved as Rapporteur in the case against Mohamed Fahmy, she had written a report in February 2014 for the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) that was critical of Egypt's judiciary process. Clooney and others were warned that there was a strong possibility they would be arrested if they entered Egypt, as a result of the criticism.[79][80] In April 2019, Clooney became a special envoy at the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, advising the Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt on global media freedom.[7][81] In her role as media freedom special envoy, Clooney will chair a panel of international lawyers to 'develop and promote legal mechanisms to prevent and reverse media abuses'.[82] Clooney studied at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she received an Exhibition[17] and the Shrigley Award.[18] Clooney received the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law from NYU School of Law.[20][21] Clooney was chosen as Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of 2015.[83] At the 2014 British Fashion Awards, Clooney was shortlisted for Best British Style alongside David Beckham, Kate Moss, Keira Knightley and Emma Watson.[84] Clooney is the president of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which she co-founded with her husband George Clooney in late 2016 to advance justice in courtrooms, communities, and classrooms around the world. Clooney partnered with the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative in beginning the Amal Clooney Scholarship, which was created to send one female student from Lebanon to the United World College Dilijan each year, to enroll in a two-year International Baccalaureate (IB) programme.[85] Clooney and her husband sponsor a Yazidi student, Hazim Avdal, who Clooney met via her work with Nadia Murad as Avdal worked at Yazda. He is attending the University of Chicago.[86] In 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the Clooneys pledged $500,000 to the March for Our Lives and said they would be in attendance.[87] Clooney is fluent in English, French, and Arabic.[88][89] She became engaged to actor George Clooney on 28 April 2014.[90] They had first met through a mutual friend in July 2013.[91] On 7 August 2014, the couple obtained marriage licences in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London.[92] They married on 27 September 2014 in Venice's city hall (at Ca' Farsetti),[93][94][95] following a high-profile wedding ceremony two days earlier, also[96] in Venice.[97][98][99] They were married by Clooney's friend Walter Veltroni, former mayor of Rome.[99][100] The wedding was widely reported in the media.[101] In October 2014, it was announced that the Clooneys had bought the Mill House on an island in the River Thames at Sonning Eye in England[102] at a cost of around \u00a310 million.[103] In February 2017, it was reported by the CBS talk show The Talk that Clooney was pregnant.[104] Friend Matt Damon confirmed the pregnancy to Entertainment Tonight.[105] In June 2017, she gave birth to fraternal twins.[106]",

Clooney and others were warned that there was a strong possibility they would be arrested if they entered Egypt, as a result of the criticism.[79][80]\nIn April 2019, Clooney became a special envoy at the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, advising the Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt on global media freedom.[7][81] In her role as media freedom special envoy, Clooney will chair a panel of international lawyers to 'develop and promote legal mechanisms to prevent and reverse media abuses'.[82]\nClooney studied at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she received an Exhibition[17] and the Shrigley Award.[18] Clooney received the Jack J.

When asked if an album was in the works, Kardashian replied, \"There's no album in the works or anything\u2014just one song we did for Kourtney and Kim Take New York, and a video Hype Williams directed, half of the proceeds we're giving away to a cancer foundation, because The-Dream's and one of my parents passed away from cancer. It's just all having fun\u2014with a good cause\".[64] Jim Farber, writing for the Daily News, called the song a \"dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature,\" and suggested that the single made Kardashian the \"worst singer in the reality TV universe.\"[65] That month, the International Business Times reported that Kardashian's 2010 earnings were the highest among Hollywood-based reality stars, estimating them at $6\u00a0million.[66][67] In April 2011, Kardashian released her third fragrance \"Gold\".[49] In March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled \"True Reflection\", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote.[68] In April, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.[69][70] In October 2012, Kardashian released her fifth fragrance, \"Glam\", which \"draws on the glamour of her Hollywood lifestyle\", and was made available through Debenhams.[71] In summer of 2012, Kardashian and her family filmed a music video in the Dominican Republic to Notorious B.I.G's song \"Hypnotize\".[72] In the romantic drama Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor (2013), produced, written, and directed by Tyler Perry, Kardashian obtained the role of the co-worker of an ambitious therapist. While the film was a moderate box office success, with a worldwide gross of US$53.1 million,[73] critical response was negative and Kardashian won the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress. Kardashian appeared on the cover, and in a pictorial in Paper's winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude.[74] On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: \"Break the Internet\", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media.[75][76] The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera.[77][78] A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and \"trying to tear down\" barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was \"just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise.\"[79] However, the stunt \"set a new benchmark\" in social media response,[80] and Paper's website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.[81][82] On October 6, 2014 Kardashian posted a jeweled homage in honor of daughter North West on Instagram in the form of some pretty Loud Love Jewelry gold rings, one for each letter of North's name[83][84][85] In June 2014, Kardashian released a mobile game for iPhone and Android called Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The objective of the game is to become a Hollywood star or starlet.[86] The game supports a free to play model, meaning the game is free to download, but charges for in-game items.[87] The game was a hit, earning US$1.6\u00a0million in its first five days of release.[87] In July, the game's developer Glu Mobile announced that the game was the fifth highest earning game in Apple's App Store.[87] Kardashian voiced the role of an alien in an episode of the adult animated series American Dad!, in season 11 (2014\u201315) in the episode titled \"Blagsnarst, A Love Story\" on September 21, 2014.[88][89] In May 2015, Kardashian released a portfolio book called Selfish, a 325-page collection of self-taken photos of herself.[90] In December 2015, Kardashian released an emoji pack for iOS devices called Kimoji.[91] The app was a best-seller, becoming one of the top 5 most bought apps that week.[91] In August 2015, Kardashian was the cover model for Vogue Spain.[92] As of November 2016, as per CBC Marketplace and interviews with celebrity endorsement experts, Kim Kardashian was paid between $75,000 and $300,000 for each post that she made on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter endorsing beauty products like waist trainers, teeth whiteners as well as Coca-Cola and well known charities. Experts think that celebrities offer fake glimpses into their lives to make viewers fall for their advertising pitches, curated to look as though the viewer is catching them in a spontaneous moment when they are mostly staged.[93] In June 2017 she launched her own beauty line, KKW Beauty and in November 2017 she launched her own fragrance line, KKW Fragrance. By 2018, according to Business Insider, Kardashian was charging $720,000 per Instagram post. Even though engagement data indicates that her posts are worth slightly less,[94] she's regularly making headlines and this allows her to demand a premium above any calculated Instagram sponsored post price. Kardashian made a cameo appearance in the heist film Ocean's 8, which was released on June 8, 2018.[95][96] In 2019, Kardashian made waves at the Met Gala with her figure hugging corset-induced Thierry Mugler dress.[97][98] In June 2019, Kardashian launched a new range of shape wear called Kimono. Kardashian was heavily criticised over the name of the brand which critics argued disrespected Japanese culture and ignored the significance behind the traditional outfit. Following the launch of the range, the hashtag #KimOhNo began trending on Twitter and the mayor of Kyoto wrote to Kardashian to ask her to reconsider the trademark on Kimono. In response to public pressure, in July 2019, Kardashian announced that she would change the name.[99] However, Japanese trade minister Hiroshige Seko stated that he would still be dispatching patent officials for a meeting at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and that Japan would keep an eye on the situation.[100] She later replaced the shapewear company to the name Skims.[101] In 2000, 19-year-old Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas.[102] Thomas filed for divorce in 2003. Kardashian later blamed their separation on physical and emotional abuse on his part[103] and said she was high on ecstasy during the ceremony.[104] Prior to the completion of her divorce, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.[102] In May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.[105] They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[106] Earlier that month, she had released her \"wedding fragrance\" called \"Kim Kardashian Love\" which coincided with her own wedding.[49][107] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a \"media blitz\" related to the wedding.[108] After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences.[109] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[110] A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case that included an apology from Jaxson.[111] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.[112] The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.[113] Kardashian began dating rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries.[114] Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013,[115] Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday,[116] and married on May 24, 2014, at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[117] Her wedding dress was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy[118] with some guests' dresses designed by designer Michael Costello.[119] The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as \"a historic blizzard of celebrity.\"[7] Kim Kardashian is a Christian and has described herself as \"really religious\".[120] She was educated in Christian schools of both the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic traditions.[120] In October 2019 she was baptized in an Armenian Apostolic ceremony at the baptistery in the Etchmiadzin Cathedral complex and given the Armenian name Heghine (\u0540\u0565\u0572\u056b\u0576\u0565).[121][122] In April 2015, Kardashian and West traveled to the Armenian Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem to have their daughter North baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church, one of the oldest denominations of Oriental Orthodox Christianity. The ceremony took place at the Cathedral of St. James.[123] Khloe Kardashian was appointed the godmother of North.[124] In October 2019, Kim baptized her three younger children at the baptistery in the Etchmiadzin Cathedral complex, Armenia's mother church.[125][126] Psalm was given the Armenian name Vardan, Chicago\u2014Ashkhen and Saint\u2014Grigor.[127] Kardashian and husband Kanye West have four children: daughter North (born June 15, 2013),[128] son Saint (born December 5, 2015),[129] daughter Chicago (born January 15, 2018),[130][131] and son Psalm (born May 9, 2019).[132][133][134] Kardashian has been open about her difficult pregnancies. She suffered pre-eclampsia during her first pregnancy, which forced her to deliver at 34 weeks. She also suffered placenta accreta after delivery, eventually having to have surgery to remove the placenta and subsequent scar tissue.[135] After her second pregnancy, her doctors advised against trying to become pregnant again.[136] The couple's third and fourth child were born via surrogate. Kardashian began suffering from psoriasis at the age of 30.[137] She was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in late 2017.[138] In May 2014, Kardashian was estimated to be worth US$45\u00a0million.[139] In 2015, Forbes reported she had \"made more this year than ever as her earnings nearly doubled to $53 million from 2014's $28 million\", and reported that she \"has monetized fame better than any other\".[140] Much of her income includes wholesale earnings of the Sears line, the Kardashian Kollection, which brought in $600 million in 2013 and the Kardashian Beauty cosmetics line, Kardashian-branded tanning products, the boutique-line DASH, as well as sponsored social media posts which are collectively worth $300,000-500,000 per post.[141][142] As of July 2018, Kardashian is worth US$350 million.[143] Combined with husband Kanye West's net worth of $160 million, their total household net worth is an estimated $510 million, making them one of the richest couples in the entertainment industry.[144] Kardashian does not receive alimony payments from either of her first two marriages.[145] During an interview with Caity Weaver of GQ for the July 2016 issue, Kardashian described herself as a Democrat, and declared support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US Presidential Election.[146] Kardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry.[147][148] She is not a citizen of either country and does not speak Armenian.[149] She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement.[150][151][152] In April 2015, Kardashian traveled to Armenia with her husband, her sister Khlo\u00e9, and her daughter North and visited the Armenian Genocide memorial Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan.[153] In April 2016, Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement denying the Armenian Genocide.[154] During her visit to Armenia in 2019, she stated that she \"talk[s] about it [the Armenian Genocide] with people internally at the White House.\" However, she added that \"haven\u2019t had a private conversation\" with President Donald Trump about it.[155] Kardashian has also worked in the area of prison reform, advocating for the commutation of the sentence of Chris Young and also of Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense as the leader of a major cocaine ring in Tennessee[156][157][158] which was granted by President Donald Trump in June 2018.[159][160] Along with Van Jones and Jared Kushner, she was instrumental in persuading President Trump to support the First Step Act, which enacted major reforms in the US prison system. Van Jones later stated that without Kardashian, the act would have never passed because it would not have received the president's support. It was later passed by a great majority in the US Senate.[161][162][163] In April 2019, it was revealed in Vogue that Kardashian was studying to pass the bar exam; instead of attending law school, she is \"reading the law.\"[164] In January 2017, she tweeted a table of statistics that went viral, highlighting statistics that show that gun violence in the United States kills 11,737 people annually while terrorism in the United States kills 14 people annually. In January 2018, the World Economic Forum awarded it the \"International Statistic of the Year\" for 2017.[165] On a trip to Uganda in October 2018, she met with President Yoweri Museveni with her husband. They had a press conference, and Kanye talked about tourism in Uganda. They were criticized for meeting the Museveni due to his being a dictator and his recent crackdown on the opposition and the Ugandan LGBT community.[166][167][168] On October 2, 2016, while attending Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in the apartment where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry.[169] The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around her mouth as a gag.[170] Kardashian, who was placed in the bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life.[171][172][173] She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped.[174] On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed \"on hold indefinitely\" after the robbery.[175] After the robbery was announced, several critics expressed skepticism about whether it was staged or not, with some even drawing comparison to Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte's recent false robbery claim.[176][177] On October 10, 2016, video was released showing Kardashian immediately after the robbery, as police began conducting their investigation. In the video, she is seen using the cell phone that she had reported stolen, and did not have any of the markings she claimed from being bound by her captors, prompting more questions as to whether or not the events were staged.[178] In response, Kardashian filed lawsuits against several media outlets the following day, and secured a gag order to get the video removed from any articles due to it being part of an active police investigation.[179][180][181] On October 25, 2016, Kardashian dropped the lawsuit, prompting more criticism that the robbery was a ploy to generate media attention.[182][183] Production resumed on Keeping Up with the Kardashians on October 26.[184] Teen Choice Awards Other awards A ^ Jenner changed her name to Caitlyn due to gender transition in 2015.[222] B ^ Shared with Kourtney, Khloe, Rob and Kris C ^ Shared with Kourtney, Khloe, Rob and Kris D ^ Shared with Kourtney, Khloe, Rob and Kris E ^ With Kourtney, Khloe, Rob, Kris, Kendall, Kylie and Caitlyn (then Bruce)",

It's just all having fun\u2014with a good cause\".[64] Jim Farber, writing for the Daily News, called the song a \"dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature,\" and suggested that the single made Kardashian the \"worst singer in the reality TV universe.\"[65]\nThat month, the International Business Times reported that Kardashian's 2010 earnings were the highest among Hollywood-based reality stars, estimating them at $6\u00a0million.[66][67]\nIn April 2011, Kardashian released her third fragrance \"Gold\".[49] In March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled \"True Reflection\", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote.[68] In April, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.[69][70] In October 2012, Kardashian released her fifth fragrance, \"Glam\", which \"draws on the glamour of her Hollywood lifestyle\", and was made available through Debenhams.[71] In summer of 2012, Kardashian and her family filmed a music video in the Dominican Republic to Notorious B.I.G's song \"Hypnotize\".[72]\nIn the romantic drama Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor (2013), produced, written, and directed by Tyler Perry, Kardashian obtained the role of the co-worker of an ambitious therapist. While the film was a moderate box office success, with a worldwide gross of US$53.1 million,[73] critical response was negative and Kardashian won the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.\nKardashian appeared on the cover, and in a pictorial in Paper's winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude.[74] On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: \"Break the Internet\", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media.[75][76] The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera.[77][78] A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and \"trying to tear down\" barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was \"just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise.\"[79] However, the stunt \"set a new benchmark\" in social media response,[80] and Paper's website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.[81][82]\nOn October 6, 2014 Kardashian posted a jeweled homage in honor of daughter North West on Instagram in the form of some pretty Loud Love Jewelry gold rings, one for each letter of North's name[83][84][85]\nIn June 2014, Kardashian released a mobile game for iPhone and Android called Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The objective of the game is to become a Hollywood star or starlet.[86] The game supports a free to play model, meaning the game is free to download, but charges for in-game items.[87] The game was a hit, earning US$1.6\u00a0million in its first five days of release.[87] In July, the game's developer Glu Mobile announced that the game was the fifth highest earning game in Apple's App Store.[87] Kardashian voiced the role of an alien in an episode of the adult animated series American Dad!, in season 11 (2014\u201315) in the episode titled \"Blagsnarst, A Love Story\" on September 21, 2014.[88][89] In May 2015, Kardashian released a portfolio book called Selfish, a 325-page collection of self-taken photos of herself.[90] In December 2015, Kardashian released an emoji pack for iOS devices called Kimoji.[91] The app was a best-seller, becoming one of the top 5 most bought apps that week.[91] In August 2015, Kardashian was the cover model for Vogue Spain.[92]\nAs of November 2016, as per CBC Marketplace and interviews with celebrity endorsement experts, Kim Kardashian was paid between $75,000 and $300,000 for each post that she made on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter endorsing beauty products like waist trainers, teeth whiteners as well as Coca-Cola and well known charities. Experts think that celebrities offer fake glimpses into their lives to make viewers fall for their advertising pitches, curated to look as though the viewer is catching them in a spontaneous moment when they are mostly staged.[93]\nIn June 2017 she launched her own beauty line, KKW Beauty and in November 2017 she launched her own fragrance line, KKW Fragrance.\nBy 2018, according to Business Insider, Kardashian was charging $720,000 per Instagram post. Even though engagement data indicates that her posts are worth slightly less,[94] she's regularly making headlines and this allows her to demand a premium above any calculated Instagram sponsored post price.\nKardashian made a cameo appearance in the heist film Ocean's 8, which was released on June 8, 2018.[95][96]\nIn 2019, Kardashian made waves at the Met Gala with her figure hugging corset-induced Thierry Mugler dress.[97][98]\nIn June 2019, Kardashian launched a new range of shape wear called Kimono. Kardashian was heavily criticised over the name of the brand which critics argued disrespected Japanese culture and ignored the significance behind the traditional outfit. Following the launch of the range, the hashtag #KimOhNo began trending on Twitter and the mayor of Kyoto wrote to Kardashian to ask her to reconsider the trademark on Kimono. In response to public pressure, in July 2019, Kardashian announced that she would change the name.[99] However, Japanese trade minister Hiroshige Seko stated that he would still be dispatching patent officials for a meeting at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and that Japan would keep an eye on the situation.[100] She later replaced the shapewear company to the name Skims.[101]\nIn 2000, 19-year-old Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas.[102] Thomas filed for divorce in 2003. Kardashian later blamed their separation on physical and emotional abuse on his part[103] and said she was high on ecstasy during the ceremony.[104] Prior to the completion of her divorce, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.[102]\nIn May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.[105] They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[106] Earlier that month, she had released her \"wedding fragrance\" called \"Kim Kardashian Love\" which coincided with her own wedding.[49][107] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a \"media blitz\" related to the wedding.[108] After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences.[109] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[110] A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case that included an apology from Jaxson.[111] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.[112] The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.[113]\nKardashian began dating rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries.[114] Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013,[115] Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday,[116] and married on May 24, 2014, at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[117] Her wedding dress was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy[118] with some guests' dresses designed by designer Michael Costello.[119] The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as \"a historic blizzard of celebrity.\"[7]\nKim Kardashian is a Christian and has described herself as \"really religious\".[120] She was educated in Christian schools of both the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic traditions.[120] In October 2019 she was baptized in an Armenian Apostolic ceremony at the baptistery in the Etchmiadzin Cathedral complex and given the Armenian name Heghine (\u0540\u0565\u0572\u056b\u0576\u0565).[121][122]\nIn April 2015, Kardashian and West traveled to the Armenian Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem to have their daughter North baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church, one of the oldest denominations of Oriental Orthodox Christianity. The ceremony took place at the Cathedral of St. James.[123] Khloe Kardashian was appointed the godmother of North.[124] In October 2019, Kim baptized her three younger children at the baptistery in the Etchmiadzin Cathedral complex, Armenia's mother church.[125][126] Psalm was given the Armenian name Vardan, Chicago\u2014Ashkhen and Saint\u2014Grigor.[127]\nKardashian and husband Kanye West have four children: daughter North (born June 15, 2013),[128] son Saint (born December 5, 2015),[129] daughter Chicago (born January 15, 2018),[130][131] and son Psalm (born May 9, 2019).[132][133][134]\nKardashian has been open about her difficult pregnancies. She suffered pre-eclampsia during her first pregnancy, which forced her to deliver at 34 weeks. She also suffered placenta accreta after delivery, eventually having to have surgery to remove the placenta and subsequent scar tissue.[135] After her second pregnancy, her doctors advised against trying to become pregnant again.[136] The couple's third and fourth child were born via surrogate.\nKardashian began suffering from psoriasis at the age of 30.[137] She was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in late 2017.[138]\nIn May 2014, Kardashian was estimated to be worth US$45\u00a0million.[139] In 2015, Forbes reported she had \"made more this year than ever as her earnings nearly doubled to $53 million from 2014's $28 million\", and reported that she \"has monetized fame better than any other\".[140] Much of her income includes wholesale earnings of the Sears line, the Kardashian Kollection, which brought in $600 million in 2013 and the Kardashian Beauty cosmetics line, Kardashian-branded tanning products, the boutique-line DASH, as well as sponsored social media posts which are collectively worth $300,000-500,000 per post.[141][142] As of July 2018, Kardashian is worth US$350 million.[143] Combined with husband Kanye West's net worth of $160 million, their total household net worth is an estimated $510 million, making them one of the richest couples in the entertainment industry.[144] Kardashian does not receive alimony payments from either of her first two marriages.[145]\nDuring an interview with Caity Weaver of GQ for the July 2016 issue, Kardashian described herself as a Democrat, and declared support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US Presidential Election.[146]\nKardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry.[147][148] She is not a citizen of either country and does not speak Armenian.[149] She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement.[150][151][152] In April 2015, Kardashian traveled to Armenia with her husband, her sister Khlo\u00e9, and her daughter North and visited the Armenian Genocide memorial Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan.[153] In April 2016, Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement denying the Armenian Genocide.[154] During her visit to Armenia in 2019, she stated that she \"talk[s] about it [the Armenian Genocide] with people internally at the White House.\" However, she added that \"haven\u2019t had a private conversation\" with President Donald Trump about it.[155]\nKardashian has also worked in the area of prison reform, advocating for the commutation of the sentence of Chris Young and also of Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense as the leader of a major cocaine ring in Tennessee[156][157][158] which was granted by President Donald Trump in June 2018.[159][160] Along with Van Jones and Jared Kushner, she was instrumental in persuading President Trump to support the First Step Act, which enacted major reforms in the US prison system. Van Jones later stated that without Kardashian, the act would have never passed because it would not have received the president's support. It was later passed by a great majority in the US Senate.[161][162][163] In April 2019, it was revealed in Vogue that Kardashian was studying to pass the bar exam; instead of attending law school, she is \"reading the law.\"[164]\nIn January 2017, she tweeted a table of statistics that went viral, highlighting statistics that show that gun violence in the United States kills 11,737 people annually while terrorism in the United States kills 14 people annually. In January 2018, the World Economic Forum awarded it the \"International Statistic of the Year\" for 2017.[165]\nOn a trip to Uganda in October 2018, she met with President Yoweri Museveni with her husband. They had a press conference, and Kanye talked about tourism in Uganda. They were criticized for meeting the Museveni due to his being a dictator and his recent crackdown on the opposition and the Ugandan LGBT community.[166][167][168]\nOn October 2, 2016, while attending Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in the apartment where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry.[169] The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around her mouth as a gag.[170] Kardashian, who was placed in the bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life.[171][172][173] She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped.[174] On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed \"on hold indefinitely\" after the robbery.[175] After the robbery was announced, several critics expressed skepticism about whether it was staged or not, with some even drawing comparison to Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte's recent false robbery claim.[176][177] On October 10, 2016, video was released showing Kardashian immediately after the robbery, as police began conducting their investigation. In the video, she is seen using the cell phone that she had reported stolen, and did not have any of the markings she claimed from being bound by her captors, prompting more questions as to whether or not the events were staged.[178] In response, Kardashian filed lawsuits against several media outlets the following day, and secured a gag order to get the video removed from any articles due to it being part of an active police investigation.[179][180][181] On October 25, 2016, Kardashian dropped the lawsuit, prompting more criticism that the robbery was a ploy to generate media attention.[182][183] Production resumed on Keeping Up with the Kardashians on October 26.[184]\nTeen Choice Awards\nOther awards\nA ^  Jenner changed her name to Caitlyn due to gender transition in 2015.[222]\nB ^  Shared with Kourtney, Khloe, Rob and Kris\nC ^  Shared with Kourtney, Khloe, Rob and Kris\nD ^  Shared with Kourtney, Khloe, Rob and Kris\nE ^  With Kourtney, Khloe, Rob, Kris, Kendall, Kylie and Caitlyn (then Bruce)\n</body></html>"

Farrow has appeared in more than 50 films and won numerous awards, including a Golden Globe Award and three BAFTA Award nominations. Farrow is also known for her extensive work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, which includes humanitarian activities in Darfur, Chad, and the Central African Republic. In 2008, Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.[2] The eldest daughter of Australian director John Farrow and Irish actress Maureen O'Sullivan, Farrow had a strict Catholic upbringing in Beverly Hills, California. After working as a fashion model during her teenage years, she first gained notice for her role as Allison MacKenzie in the television soap opera Peyton Place (1964\u20131966). Her credited feature film debut in Guns at Batasi (1964) earned her a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, and she gained further recognition for her subsequent two-year marriage to Frank Sinatra, whom she married at age 21. Farrow's portrayal of Rosemary Woodhouse in the horror film Rosemary's Baby (1968) saw her nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. She earned a third Golden Globe nomination for her role in John and Mary (1969). In 1971, Farrow became the first American actress in history to join the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing as Joan of Arc in a production of Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher. This was followed by stage productions of Mary Rose (1972), Three Sisters (1973), and Ivanov (1976). Farrow also starred in several films throughout the 1970s, notably as Daisy Buchanan in the 1974 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby, and Robert Altman's comedy A Wedding (1978). Farrow began a relationship with filmmaker Woody Allen in 1979, and over a decade-long period starred in 13 of his films, beginning with A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982). She received numerous critical accolades for her performances in several of Allen's films, including Golden Globe Award nominations for Broadway Danny Rose (1984), The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), and Alice (1990), as well as a BAFTA nomination for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). After separating from Allen in 1992, Farrow made public allegations that he sexually assaulted their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan, which he has repeatedly denied. Despite inconclusive evidence, Farrow retained custody of Dylan. These claims received significant renewed public attention after Dylan recounted the alleged assault in a 2013 interview. Since the 2000s, Farrow has made occasional appearances on television, such as a recurring role on Third Watch (2001\u20132003), and had supporting parts in such films as The Omen (2006), Be Kind Rewind (2008), and Dark Horse (2011). She has also dedicated significant periods to raising her multiple adopted and biological children, as well participating in humanitarian efforts abroad, specifically regarding human rights in African countries. Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Villiers Farrow[3] was born February 9, 1945,[4][5] in Los Angeles, California, the third child and eldest daughter of Australian film director John Farrow and Irish actress Maureen O'Sullivan. She is one of seven children, with older brothers Michael Damien (1939\u20131958), Patrick (1942\u20132009),[6] younger brother John Charles (born 1946); and younger sisters Prudence and actresses Stephanie and Tisa.[7] Her godparents were director George Cukor and columnist Louella Parsons.[8] Her sister Prudence inspired John Lennon to write the song \"Dear Prudence\".[9] Farrow was raised in Beverly Hills, California, in a strict Roman Catholic household.[10][11] She was described by her family as an eccentric and imaginative child,[8] and would occasionally put on performances with \"toy daggers and fake blood\" for passing celebrity tour buses.[12] Aged two, she made her film debut in a short documentary, Unusual Occupations: Film Tot Holiday (1947).[13] Farrow attended Catholic parochial schools in Los Angeles for her primary education.[8] At nine years old, she contracted polio during an outbreak in Los Angeles County reportedly affecting 500 people.[14] She was placed in an isolation ward for three weeks[15] and later said the experience \"marked the end of [her] childhood.\"[12] In 1958, the Farrow family temporarily relocated to Spain, where her father was filming John Paul Jones (1959). Farrow, then age 13, made a brief uncredited appearance in the film.[8] In September 1958, Farrow and her sister Prudence were sent to attend a convent-operated boarding school in Surrey, England[8][12][16] while her father completed post-production on John Paul Jones in London.[17] On October 28, Farrow's eldest brother Michael died in a plane crash near Pacoima, California.[8][18] After his burial, Farrow returned to boarding school in Surrey, while her family temporarily lived in the London Park Lane Hotel before renting a home in Chelsea.[19] Farrow's father began drinking heavily during this time, which caused strain on his marriage to her mother.[20] In her memoir, Farrow recalls witnessing violent arguments between her parents while visiting their Chelsea residence.[21] When Farrow was 16, she returned with her family to the United States and continued her education at a Catholic preparatory school in Los Angeles.[8] During this time, her parents were struggling financially, and her mother relocated to New York City to act in Broadway productions.[22] Farrow's father remained in California, where he died the following year of a heart attack when she was 17 years old.[23] The family was left with little money after her father's death, prompting Farrow to begin working to help support herself and her siblings. She initially found work as a fashion model[24] before appearing as a replacement in a New York stage production of The Importance of Being Earnest.[25] Farrow screen-tested for the role of Liesl von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965), but did not get the part.[26] The footage has been preserved, and appears on the fortieth Anniversary Edition DVD of The Sound of Music.[27] She began her acting career by appearing in supporting roles in several 1960s films, making her first credited appearance in Guns at Batasi (1964). The same year, she achieved stardom on the successful primetime soap opera Peyton Place as naive, waif-like Allison MacKenzie.[28] Farrow left the series in 1966 at the urging of Frank Sinatra whom she married on July 19, 1966.[29][30] She subsequently appeared in her first featured role in the British spy film A Dandy in Aspic (1968).[31] Farrow's first leading film role was in the psychological horror film Rosemary's Baby (1968), which was a critical and commercial success and continues to be highly regarded as a classic of the horror genre, named the second-best horror film of all time by The Guardian in 2010.[32] Her performance garnered numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress,[33] and established her as a leading actress. Film critic and author Stephen Farber described her performance as having an \"electrifying impact... one of the rare instances of actor and character achieving a miraculous, almost mythical match\". Film critic Roger Ebert called the film \"brilliant,\" and noted, \"A great deal of the credit for this achievement must go to Mia Farrow, as Rosemary.\"[34] Following Rosemary's Baby, Farrow was to be cast as Mattie in True Grit and was keen on the role. However, prior to filming she made Secret Ceremony in England with Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Mitchum. While filming, Mitchum told her about True Grit director Henry Hathaway having a reputation for being rude to actresses. Farrow asked producer Hal Wallis to replace Hathaway. Wallis refused; Farrow then quit the role, which was then given to Kim Darby.[35] Secret Ceremony divided critics, but has gone on to develop a devoted following. Farrow's other late 1960s films include John and Mary (1969) opposite Dustin Hoffman,[36] for which Farrow earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.[33] Beginning in the early 1970s, Farrow appeared onstage in numerous classical plays in London, beginning with the Royal Shakespeare Company's 1971 production of Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher\u2014in which she portrayed Joan of Arc\u2014at the Royal Albert Hall.[37] Farrow made history as the first American actress to join the Royal Shakespeare Company.[4] The same year, she appeared in the British horror film See No Evil, portraying a blind woman whose family is stalked by a killer.[38] Though he gave the film a mixed review, Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote that Farrow \"plays her blind patrician with exactly the right small depth of pathos and vulnerable nobility.\"[38] Farrow also starred in the television film Goodbye, Raggedy Ann (1971), playing an unstable Hollywood starlet.[39] In 1972, Farrow starred in the French black comedy film Dr. Popaul, opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo, as a secretary who marries a womanizer,[40] and in Carol Reed's Follow Me! as a woman suspected of having an affair by her wealthy husband.[41] Onstage, she starred as the lead in a 1972 stage production of Mary Rose,[42] followed by the role of Irina in The Three Sisters,[43] and a dual role in The House of Bernarda Alba (both 1973).[44] Farrow was cast as Daisy Buchanan in the 1974 Paramount Pictures film adaptation of The Great Gatsby, directed by Jack Clayton.[45] The film was a commercial success, grossing over $25 million in the United States,[46] while Variety deemed it \"the most concerted attempt to probe the peculiar ethos of the Beautiful People of the 1920s.\"[45] In 1975, Farrow was cast as the lead in a stage production of The Marrying of Ann Leete, followed by The Zykovs (1976), both of which were staged at the Aldwych Theatre.[47][48] She again appeared at the Aldwych in the 1976 production of Ivanov, portraying Sasha.[49] She also appeared onscreen, portraying Peter Pan in the television musical film Peter Pan (1976), and as a woman haunted by the ghost a deceased girl in the horror film Full Circle (1977).[50] Farrow had a supporting role in Robert Altman's comedy A Wedding (1978), playing the mute daughter of a trucking company tycoon.[51] The same year, she starred with Rock Hudson in the disaster film Avalanche,[51] followed by the British Agatha Christie adaptation Death on the Nile.[52] In 1979, Farrow appeared on Broadway opposite Anthony Perkins in the play Romantic Comedy by Bernard Slade,[53][54] and in the romance film Hurricane, opposite Jason Robards.[55] Beginning in the 1980s, Farrow's relationship with director Woody Allen resulted in numerous film collaborations. Her first film with Allen was the comedy A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982), in a role originally intended for Diane Keaton.[56] She next appeared in Allen's Zelig (1983), portraying a psychiatrist whose patient, Leonard Zelig (Allen), takes on characteristics of those around him in an effort to be liked.[57] In Broadway Danny Rose (1984), Farrow starred as the mistress of a washed-up lounge musician who becomes involved with the mob; her character, as well as the film itself, was spurred by a real-life woman she and Allen frequently encountered while dining at Rao's, an Italian restaurant in East Harlem.[58] Farrow gained weight for the role and adopted a thick Italian accent; Allen biographer John Bailey described her as \"unrecognizable\" in the role.[58] Farrow's performance gained her critical notice, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.[33] Allen subsequently reflected that her performance was a \"very, very brave thing for her to do,\" as the majority of her scenes required her to wear sunglasses that block view of her eyes.[59] Farrow also voiced the title role in the animated film The Last Unicorn (1982). \u2013Woody Allen[60] After Broadway Danny Rose, Farrow had a supporting role in Jeannot Szwarc's superhero film Supergirl (1984), playing Alura In-Ze, the mother of Supergirl.[61] The film was considered a box office bomb, earning only $13 million against its $35 million budget.[62][63] Farrow reunited with Allen for 1985's The Purple Rose of Cairo, which follows a film character (portrayed by Jeff Daniels) who emerges from the screen and enters the real world, where he falls in love with a waitress (Farrow).[64] Farrow's portrayal in the film earned her a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress[65] as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.[33] Allen next cast Farrow as the lead in his drama Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), which follows a New York City family over a period of two years between two Thanksgivings.[66] In the film, Farrow starred as the titular Hannah opposite Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest (both of whom portray her sisters), and Michael Caine as her husband.[66] Released in the fall of 1986, Hannah and Her Sisters was a box-office hit, grossing $35 million in the United States during its original theatrical release.[67] The film was praised by critic Roger Ebert, who felt it was Allen's best work to date,[68] and Farrow earned her third BAFTA nomination, again in the category of Best Leading Actress.[69] In 1987, Farrow appeared in two films directed by Allen: the comedy Radio Days, in which she had a supporting role as an aspiring radio star;[70] and the drama September, in which she played a woman haunted by her killing of her mother's abusive lover.[71] Farrow shot the latter film twice, originally with her real-life mother Maureen O'Sullivan playing her character's mother in the film.[71] Displeased with the final cut, Allen decided to recast several roles and reshoot the film entirely; the second and final version featured Elaine Stritch in O'Sullivan's role.[72] Farrow was subsequently cast opposite Gena Rowlands in Allen's drama Another Woman (1988), which follows a philosophy professor (Rowlands) who becomes acquainted with a troubled woman experiencing an existential crisis (Farrow).[73] While the film earned praise from critics such as Roger Ebert,[74] its screenplay and dialogue were criticized by Vincent Canby in The New York Times, who described it as \"full of an earnest teen-age writer's superfluous words.\"[75] In 1989, Farrow starred in a segment of Allen's anthology film New York Stories, playing the shiksa fianc\u00e9e of a Jewish man (Allen); she also appeared in a supporting role in Crimes and Misdemeanors as a producer who falls in love with a documentary filmmaker.[76] She was next cast by Allen in his fantasy film Alice (1990), marking the couple's 11th collaboration.[77] In Alice, Farrow portrays the title character, an upper-class Manhattan woman who becomes enamored with a jazz musician; her attraction results in feelings of Catholic guilt that manifest as physical ailments which she attempts to treat with herbal medicine.[78] Vincent Canby praised her portrayal as career-defining, writing: \"Miss Farrow gives a performance that sums up and then tops all of the performances that have preceded it.\"[77] She was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical,[33] and won a National Board of Review award for Best Actress.[79] The next year, Farrow appeared as a circus performer in Allen's black-and-white comedy Shadows and Fog.[80] Farrow had a lead role in Allen's drama Husbands and Wives (1992), in which she portrayed the wife of a writer and professor (Allen) having an affair with one of his students.[81] Husbands and Wives marked Farrow's final collaboration with Allen, and was released shortly after the couple's highly publicized separation.[81] Todd McCarthy of Variety noted in his review of the film that much of its audience would watch it \"for the titillation of seeing Allen make out with a 21-year-old and go through a wrenching split from Farrow onscreen. Even those who enter in this frame of mind, however, probably will put these thoughts aside for the most part as they become involved in the romantic longings and verbal crossfire of a host of interesting, difficult, intersecting characters.\"[82] Citing the need to devote herself to raising her young children, Farrow worked less frequently during the 1990s. Nonetheless, she appeared in leading roles in several films, including the Irish film Widows' Peak (1994), in which she starred as a vengeful, matriarchal figure in a small Irish village,[83] and in the comedy Miami Rhapsody (1995), playing the mother of a single woman in her thirties (played by Sarah Jessica Parker).[84] Farrow also had a lead role in the film adaptation of Craig Lucas's Off-Broadway play Reckless, a dark comedy in which she portrayed a woman whose husband takes a contract killing out against her.[85] Critic Stephen Holden praised her performance, writing: \"Ms. Farrow is so perfectly cast as Rachel that the character seems a distillation of nearly every role she has played since she was a teen-ager in Peyton Place.\"[85] In the spring of 1996, Farrow had an uncredited voice role in the Broadway play Getting Away with Murder, appearing in a pre-recorded voice message.[86] In 1997, Farrow published her autobiography, What Falls Away,[87] and had a cameo appearance playing herself in Howard Stern's biographical comedy, Private Parts.[88] She then appeared on television in the 1998 The Wonderful World of Disney segment Miracle at Midnight, a dramatization of the Rescue of the Danish Jews during the Holocaust.[89] Will Joyner of The New York Times credited Farrow's performance in the segment as \"crucial to the production's success.\"[89] Farrow was next cast as a woman suffering Alzheimer's disease in the television film Forget Me Never.[90] Critic Steven Linan of the Los Angeles Times praised Farrow, writing that she \"convincingly conveys the fear and insecurity that accompany such a downward spiral.\"[90] Her portrayal earned her her seventh Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, in the category of Miniseries or Television Film.[33] Also in 1999, Farrow appeared in the comedy Coming Soon, playing the hippie mother of a high school student.[91] In November 1999, Farrow returned to Broadway portraying Honey in a staged reading of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, opposite Matthew Broderick, Jonathan Pryce, and Uta Hagen.[92] Vincent Canby praised the production in The New York Times, writing that \"as performed by Mr. Broderick and Ms. Farrow, Nick and Honey took on dimensions I have never seen before.\"[92] The reading was subsequently staged in Los Angeles in the spring of 2000.[93] The 2000s saw Farrow appearing on television, beginning with a recurring role on the series Third Watch, in which she guest-starred in five episodes between 2000 and 2003.[94] Farrow also appeared in the 2001 LGBT-themed television film A Girl Thing, opposite Kate Capshaw and Stockard Channing,[95] followed by a lead in the Lifetime film The Secret Life of Zoey in 2002.[96] She also appeared in a touring stage production of The Exonerated the same year,[97] followed by the lead in Fran's Bed, staged at Connecticut's Long Wharf Theatre in the fall of 2003.[98] She subsequently had a supporting part in the children's television film Samantha: An American Girl Holiday (2004).[99] Farrow made her first feature film appearance in several years as Mrs. Baylock, a Satanic nanny, in the remake of The Omen (2006). Although the film itself received a lukewarm critical reception, Farrow's performance was widely praised, with the Associated Press declaring \"thank heaven for Mia Farrow\" and calling her performance \"a rare instance of the new Omen improving on the old one.\"[100] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer also praised her performance, describing it as \"a truly delicious comeback role... Farrow [is] chillingly believable as a sweet-talking nanny from hell.\"[101] Farrow subsequently appeared as the mother of a Manhattan attorney (played by Amanda Peet) in the romantic comedy The Ex (2007), also starring opposite Jason Bateman and Zach Braff.[102] The film received a largely unfavorable response from critics, with several writing that the cast's talents were underserved by the material.[103][104] She then voiced Daisy Suchot in Luc Besson's animated fantasy film Arthur and the Invisibles (2007).[105] The following year, Farrow appeared in a supporting role opposite Danny Glover in Michel Gondry's comedy Be Kind Rewind (2008), playing the friend and patron of a video store operator in suburban New Jersey.[106] She also provided voice narration for the documentary film As We Forgive (2008), which recounts the stories of two Rwandan women who confronted the individuals who murdered their families during the Rwandan genocide.[107] In 2009, Farrow reprised her voice role as Daisy Suchot in Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard,[108] and again for Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds (2010).[109] She was subsequently cast in a supporting role in the comedy-drama Dark Horse, directed by Todd Solondz,[110] in which she played the mother of a stunted 35-year-old man.[111] In September 2014, Farrow returned to Broadway in the play Love Letters. The play was well-received by critics,[112] with Charles Isherwood of The New York Times deeming Farrow's performance \"utterly extraordinary\u2026\u00a0 as the flighty, unstable and writing-averse Melissa Gardner.\"[113] In 2016, Farrow appeared with Faye Dunaway in an episode of the IFC mockumentary series Documentary Now!.[114] Farrow became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2000 and is a high-profile advocate for human rights in Africa, particularly for children's rights. She has worked to raise funds and awareness for children in conflict-affected regions and to draw attention to the fight to eradicate polio.[4] Farrow has received several awards for her humanitarian work[115][116] including the Leon Sullivan International Service award,[117] the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award[118] and the Marion Anderson Award.[119] In 2006, Farrow and her son Ronan visited Berlin in order to participate in a charity auction of United Buddy Bears, which feature designs by artists representing 142 U.N. member states.[120] In 2008, Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.[121][2] She has traveled to Darfur several times for humanitarian efforts, first in 2004.[122] Her third trip was in 2007, with a film crew engaged in making the documentary Darfur: On Our Watch.[123] The same year, she co-founded the Olympic Dream for Darfur campaign, which drew attention to China's support for the government of Sudan. The campaign hoped to change China's policy by embarrassing it in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing. In March 2007, China said it would urge Sudan to engage with the international community. The campaign persuaded Steven Spielberg to withdraw as an artistic adviser to the opening ceremony. During the Olympics, Farrow televised via the internet from a Sudanese refugee camp to highlight China's involvement in the region.[124] Later in 2007, Farrow offered to \"trade her freedom\" for the freedom of a humanitarian worker for the Sudan Liberation Army who was being treated in a UN hospital while under threat of arrest. She wanted to be taken captive in exchange for his being allowed to leave the country.[125] Farrow is also a board member of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Darfur Women Action Group (DWAG).[126] In 2009, Farrow narrated a documentary, As We Forgive, relating the struggle of many of the survivors of the Rwandan genocide to forgive those who murdered family and friends.[127] To show \"solidarity with the people of Darfur\" Farrow began a water-only fast on April 27, 2009.[128] Farrow's goal was to fast for three weeks, but she called a halt after twelve days on the advice of her doctor.[129] In August 2010, she testified in the trial against former Liberian President Charles Taylor in the Special Court for Sierra Leone.[130] Farrow helped build The Darfur Archives, which document the cultural traditions of the tribes of Darfur.[131] She has filmed some 40 hours of songs, dances, children's stories, farming methods and accounts of genocide in the region's refugee camps that make up the current archives.[132] Since 2011, the Archives have been housed at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut.[133] In 2013, Farrow criticized President Barack Obama for his lack of address regarding Sudanese genocide during a United Nations General Assembly.[132] In February 2015, Farrow appeared in an episode of A Path Appears, a PBS documentary series from the creators of the Half the Sky movement. In the episode Farrow travels to Kibera, Kenya's largest slum, to share stories from organizations providing education to at-risk girls.[134][135] Farrow has also participated in environmental activism, in 2014 protesting against Chevron, accusing the oil company of environmental damage in the South American rainforest.[136] Though she has been critical of the Roman Catholic Church (such as for the Pope's failure to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda, a predominantly Catholic country), Farrow is a devout Catholic[16] and maintained in a 2013 interview with Piers Morgan that she had not \"lost her faith in God\".[137] Previously at age 23, Farrow spent part of 1968 living at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India, studying Transcendental Meditation.[138] Her visit received worldwide media attention at the time because of the presence of all four members of the Beatles, Donovan, and Mike Love, as well as her sister Prudence Farrow.[139][140] Farrow has stated that she has long been a registered Independent, though she has consistently voted for Democratic candidates.[141] In the 2016 Democratic presidential election, Farrow publicly endorsed Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders,[142][143] though she subsequently stated that \"as a pragmatist\" she planned to vote for Hillary Clinton.[141] On July 19, 1966,[144] she married singer Frank Sinatra at the Las Vegas home of Jack Entratter.[145][146] Farrow was 21 years old, Sinatra 50.[28] Sinatra wanted Farrow to give up her acting career, which she initially agreed to do.[145] She accompanied Sinatra while he was shooting several films, but soon tired of doing nothing and signed on to star in Rosemary's Baby. Filming of Rosemary's Baby ran over its initial schedule, which angered Sinatra, who had cast Farrow in a role in his film The Detective (1968). After Farrow failed to report for filming, Sinatra cast actress Jacqueline Bisset in Farrow's role.[147] In November 1967, while Farrow was filming Rosemary's Baby, Sinatra's lawyer served her with divorce papers.[148] Their divorce was finalized in August 1968.[149] Farrow later blamed the demise of the marriage on their age difference, and said she was an \"impossibly immature teenager\" when she married Sinatra.[150][151] The two remained friends until Sinatra's death.[148] On September 10, 1970, Farrow married conductor and composer Andr\u00e9 Previn in London; she was 25 and he was 41.[152] Farrow had begun a relationship with Previn while he was still married to his second wife, songwriter Dory Previn. When Farrow became pregnant, Previn left Dory and filed for divorce. Farrow gave birth to twin sons in February 1970,[152] and Previn's divorce from Dory became final in July 1970.[153] Dory Previn later wrote a scathing song, titled \"Beware of Young Girls\", about the loss of her husband to Farrow.[154] Previn and Farrow divorced in 1979.[26] In 1979, Farrow began a relationship with film director Woody Allen.[155][156] During their relationship, Farrow starred in some of Allen's films, and several of her relatives also made appearances.[156] Their relationship ended in 1992 when Allen\u2019s intimate relationship with Soon-Yi Previn (Farrow's adopted daughter) who was 22 years old at the time became publicized.[157] Farrow and former husband Andr\u00e9 Previn have three biological children: twins Matthew and Sascha (born February 26, 1970),[159] and Fletcher (born March 14, 1974).[160] Sascha is a graduate of Fordham University,[161] while Fletcher, a graduate of Connecticut College, became the chief information officer of IBM.[162] Farrow and Previn adopted Vietnamese infants Lark Song Previn and Summer \"Daisy\" Song Previn, in 1973 and 1976, respectively,[163] followed by the adoption of Soon-Yi from Korea around 1978. Soon-Yi's precise birth date is not known, but a bone scan estimated her age as between 5 and 7 at the time of her adoption.[157] The Seoul Family Court established a Family Census Register (legal birth document) in her behalf on December 28, 1976, with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970.[164][165] In 1980, following her divorce from Previn, Farrow as a single mother adopted Moses Farrow, a two-year-old Korean orphan with cerebral palsy.[161] In 1985, Farrow adopted Dylan Farrow (born July 1985, adopted at two weeks old).[166] Dylan was known as \"Eliza\" for some time and also as \"Malone\".[167][144] In December 1991, a New York City court allowed Woody Allen to co-adopt Dylan and Moses.[168] With Allen, Farrow gave birth to her fourth and final biological child, son Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow (later known simply as Ronan Farrow),[3] on December 19, 1987.[169] In a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Farrow stated Ronan could \"possibly\" be the biological child of Frank Sinatra, with whom she claimed to have \"never really split up\".[170] In a 2015 CBS Sunday Morning\u00a0interview, Sinatra's daughter Nancy dismissed the idea that her father is also the biological father of Ronan Farrow, calling it \"nonsense\". She said that her children were affected by the rumor because they were being questioned about it. \"I was kind of cranky with Mia for even saying 'possibly', she added. \"I was cranky with her for saying that because she knew better, you know, she really did. But she was making a joke! And it was taken very serious and was just silly, stupid.\"[171] Between 1992 and 1995, Farrow adopted five more children: Tam Farrow; Kaeli-Shea Farrow, later known as Quincy Maureen Farrow; Frankie-Minh; Isaiah Justus; and Gabriel Wilk Farrow, later known as Thaddeus Wilk Farrow[172] and named after Elliott Wilk, the judge who oversaw Farrow's 1993 legal battle with Allen.[173] Tam Farrow died of heart failure in 2000 at the age of 21 after a long illness.[174] In May 2018, Moses Farrow made claims on his personal blog that Tam had actually died from a prescription medication overdose following a lifelong battle with depression.[175] On December 25, 2008, Lark Previn died at the age of 35, also after a long illness.[176] Moses claimed that Lark's death was due to AIDS-related illness, following a long battle with addiction.[175] On September 21, 2016, Thaddeus Farrow was found dead at the age of 27 after an apparent car crash in Connecticut,[177] though it was subsequently ruled he had committed suicide by shooting himself in the torso while inside his car.[178] According to court testimony, on August 4, 1992, Allen visited Farrow's farm in Bridgewater, Connecticut, while she was out grocery shopping.[157] The following day, August 5, a babysitter informed Farrow that she had witnessed Allen behaving strangely with the couple's then-seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan.[157] When Farrow asked Dylan about the alleged incident, Dylan responded that Allen had touched her \"private part\" while the two were alone in the attic of the home.[157] One of the women employed to care for Farrow's children claimed that for around 20 minutes that afternoon she had not known where Dylan was, while a second said that, at one point, she noticed Dylan had been wearing no underwear beneath her dress.[179] Farrow reported the incident to the family's pediatrician, who in turn reported the allegations to authorities.[157] Allen was informed of the accusations on August 6. A week later, on August 13, Allen sued for full custody of his biological son, Satchel, and two of Farrow's adopted children, Dylan and Moses, with whom Allen had assumed a parental role.[180][181] In March 1993, the lead doctor of Yale New Haven Hospital Child Sexual Abuse Clinic, Dr. John Leventhal, gave sworn testimony via a deposition that,[182] in his opinion, Dylan \"either invented the story under the stress of living in a volatile and unhealthy home or that it was planted in her mind by her mother\" because of the \"inconsistent\" presentation of the story by Dylan.[183] Leventhal did not meet with Dylan prior to giving his testimony, and instead delivered his findings based on interviews conducted by others.[180] The Yale New Haven Hospital team's findings were criticized by the presiding judge, and later by other experts in the field, who found their behavior unusual for making conclusive statements about innocence and guilt, instead of reporting on behavior, for refusing to testify in court when asked, and for destroying all of their notes.[184][185] Justice Wilk stated that the investigating team's behavior had \"resulted in a report which was sanitized and, therefore, less credible\" and that its recommendations and statements had \"exceed[ed] its mandate.\" He concluded, \"I am less certain, however, than is the Yale-New Haven team, that the evidence proves conclusively that there was no sexual abuse.\"[181] In his final decision, in June 1993, Justice Wilk stated that he found \"no credible evidence to support Mr. Allen's contention that Ms. Farrow coached Dylan or that Ms. Farrow acted upon a desire for revenge against him for seducing Soon-Yi. Mr. Allen's resort to the stereotypical 'woman scorned' defense is an injudicious attempt to divert attention from his failure to act as a responsible parent and adult.\"[180] He rejected Allen's bid for full custody and denied him visitation rights with Dylan, stating that even though the full truth of the allegations may never be known, \"the credible testimony of Ms. Farrow, Dr. Coates, Dr. Leventhal and Mr. Allen does, however, prove that Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.\"[181] In September 1993, the state's attorney, Frank Maco, announced he would not pursue Allen in court for the molestation allegations, despite having \"probable cause,\" citing his and Farrow's desire not to traumatize Dylan further.[186] In 2013, Moses Farrow publicly asserted that Mia had coached her children into believing stories she made up about Allen.[187][188] In February 2014, Dylan publicly renewed her claims of sexual abuse against Allen, in an open letter published by Nicholas Kristof, a friend of Farrow, in his New York Times blog.[189][190][191] Allen repeated his denial of the allegations.[192][193] In May 2018, Moses published a blog post expressing his father's innocence, stating that, \"I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.\"[175] Soon-Yi Previn echoed these claims in September 2018 in an article written by Daphne Merkin.[194] Moses also alleged in his response that Mia had physically abused him with spankings and other punishment during his childhood.[195] Informational Interviews and articles",

Farrow has appeared in more than 50 films and won numerous awards, including a Golden Globe Award and three BAFTA Award nominations. Farrow is also known for her extensive work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, which includes humanitarian activities in Darfur, Chad, and the Central African Republic. In 2008, Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.[2]\nThe eldest daughter of Australian director John Farrow and Irish actress Maureen O'Sullivan, Farrow had a strict Catholic upbringing in Beverly Hills, California. After working as a fashion model during her teenage years, she first gained notice for her role as Allison MacKenzie in the television soap opera Peyton Place (1964\u20131966). Her credited feature film debut in Guns at Batasi (1964) earned her a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, and she gained further recognition for her subsequent two-year marriage to Frank Sinatra, whom she married at age 21. Farrow's portrayal of Rosemary Woodhouse in the horror film Rosemary's Baby (1968) saw her nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. She earned a third Golden Globe nomination for her role in John and Mary (1969).\nIn 1971, Farrow became the first American actress in history to join the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing as Joan of Arc in a production of Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher. This was followed by stage productions of Mary Rose (1972), Three Sisters (1973), and Ivanov (1976). Farrow also starred in several films throughout the 1970s, notably as Daisy Buchanan in the 1974 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby, and Robert Altman's comedy A Wedding (1978).\nFarrow began a relationship with filmmaker Woody Allen in 1979, and over a decade-long period starred in 13 of his films, beginning with A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982). She received numerous critical accolades for her performances in several of Allen's films, including Golden Globe Award nominations for Broadway Danny Rose (1984), The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), and Alice (1990), as well as a BAFTA nomination for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). After separating from Allen in 1992, Farrow made public allegations that he sexually assaulted their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan, which he has repeatedly denied. Despite inconclusive evidence, Farrow retained custody of Dylan. These claims received significant renewed public attention after Dylan recounted the alleged assault in a 2013 interview.\nSince the 2000s, Farrow has made occasional appearances on television, such as a recurring role on Third Watch (2001\u20132003), and had supporting parts in such films as The Omen (2006), Be Kind Rewind (2008), and Dark Horse (2011). She has also  dedicated significant periods to raising her multiple adopted and biological children, as well participating in humanitarian efforts abroad, specifically regarding human rights in African countries.\nMar\u00eda de Lourdes Villiers Farrow[3] was born February 9, 1945,[4][5] in Los Angeles, California, the third child and eldest daughter of Australian film director John Farrow and Irish actress Maureen O'Sullivan. She is one of seven children, with older brothers Michael Damien (1939\u20131958), Patrick (1942\u20132009),[6] younger brother John Charles (born 1946); and younger sisters Prudence and actresses Stephanie and Tisa.[7] Her godparents were director George Cukor and columnist Louella Parsons.[8] Her sister Prudence inspired John Lennon to write the song \"Dear Prudence\".[9]\nFarrow was raised in Beverly Hills, California, in a strict Roman Catholic household.[10][11] She was described by her family as an eccentric and imaginative child,[8] and would occasionally put on performances with \"toy daggers and fake blood\" for passing celebrity tour buses.[12] Aged two, she made her film debut in a short documentary, Unusual Occupations: Film Tot Holiday (1947).[13] Farrow attended Catholic parochial schools in Los Angeles for her primary education.[8] At nine years old, she contracted polio during an outbreak in Los Angeles County reportedly affecting 500 people.[14] She was placed in an isolation ward for three weeks[15] and later said the experience \"marked the end of [her] childhood.\"[12]\nIn 1958, the Farrow family temporarily relocated to Spain, where her father was filming John Paul Jones (1959). Farrow, then age 13, made a brief uncredited appearance in the film.[8] In September 1958, Farrow and her sister Prudence were sent to attend a convent-operated boarding school in Surrey, England[8][12][16] while her father completed post-production on John Paul Jones in London.[17] On October 28, Farrow's eldest brother Michael died in a plane crash near Pacoima, California.[8][18] After his burial, Farrow returned to boarding school in Surrey, while her family temporarily lived in the London Park Lane Hotel before renting a home in Chelsea.[19] Farrow's father began drinking heavily during this time, which caused strain on his marriage to her mother.[20] In her memoir, Farrow recalls witnessing violent arguments between her parents while visiting their Chelsea residence.[21]\nWhen Farrow was 16, she returned with her family to the United States and continued her education at a Catholic preparatory school in Los Angeles.[8] During this time, her parents were struggling financially, and her mother relocated to New York City to act in Broadway productions.[22] Farrow's father remained in California, where he died the following year of a heart attack when she was 17 years old.[23] The family was left with little money after her father's death, prompting Farrow to begin working to help support herself and her siblings. She initially found work as a fashion model[24] before appearing as a replacement in a New York stage production of The Importance of Being Earnest.[25]\nFarrow screen-tested for the role of Liesl von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965), but did not get the part.[26] The footage has been preserved, and appears on the fortieth Anniversary Edition DVD of The Sound of Music.[27]  She began her acting career by appearing in supporting roles in several 1960s films, making her first credited appearance in Guns at Batasi (1964). The same year, she achieved stardom on the successful primetime soap opera Peyton Place as naive, waif-like Allison MacKenzie.[28] Farrow left the series in 1966 at the urging of Frank Sinatra whom she married on July 19, 1966.[29][30] She subsequently appeared in her first featured role in the British spy film A Dandy in Aspic (1968).[31]\nFarrow's first leading film role was in the psychological horror film Rosemary's Baby (1968), which was a critical and commercial success and continues to be highly regarded as a classic of the horror genre, named the second-best horror film of all time by The Guardian in 2010.[32] Her performance garnered numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress,[33] and established her as a leading actress. Film critic and author Stephen Farber described her performance as having an \"electrifying impact... one of the rare instances of actor and character achieving a miraculous, almost mythical match\". Film critic Roger Ebert called the film \"brilliant,\" and noted, \"A great deal of the credit for this achievement must go to Mia Farrow, as Rosemary.\"[34]\nFollowing Rosemary's Baby, Farrow was to be cast as Mattie in True Grit and was keen on the role. However, prior to filming she made Secret Ceremony in England with Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Mitchum. While filming, Mitchum told her about True Grit director Henry Hathaway having a reputation for being rude to actresses. Farrow asked producer Hal Wallis to replace Hathaway. Wallis refused; Farrow then quit the role, which was then given to Kim Darby.[35] Secret Ceremony divided critics, but has gone on to develop a devoted following. Farrow's other late 1960s films include John and Mary (1969) opposite Dustin Hoffman,[36] for which Farrow earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.[33]\nBeginning in the early 1970s, Farrow appeared onstage in numerous classical plays in London, beginning with the Royal Shakespeare Company's 1971 production of Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher\u2014in which she portrayed Joan of Arc\u2014at the Royal Albert Hall.[37] Farrow made history as the first American actress to join the Royal Shakespeare Company.[4] The same year, she appeared in the British horror film See No Evil, portraying a blind woman whose family is stalked by a killer.[38] Though he gave the film a mixed review, Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote that Farrow \"plays her blind patrician with exactly the right small depth of pathos and vulnerable nobility.\"[38] Farrow also starred in the television film Goodbye, Raggedy Ann (1971), playing an unstable Hollywood starlet.[39] In 1972, Farrow starred in the French black comedy film Dr. Popaul, opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo, as a secretary who marries a womanizer,[40] and in Carol Reed's Follow Me! as a woman suspected of having an affair by her wealthy husband.[41] Onstage, she starred as the lead in a 1972 stage production of Mary Rose,[42] followed by the role of Irina in The Three Sisters,[43] and a dual role in The House of Bernarda Alba (both 1973).[44]\nFarrow was cast as Daisy Buchanan in the 1974 Paramount Pictures film adaptation of The Great Gatsby, directed by Jack Clayton.[45] The film was a commercial success, grossing over $25 million in the United States,[46] while Variety deemed it \"the most concerted attempt to probe the peculiar ethos of the Beautiful People of the 1920s.\"[45] In 1975, Farrow was cast as the lead in a stage production of The Marrying of Ann Leete, followed by The Zykovs (1976), both of which were staged at the Aldwych Theatre.[47][48] She again appeared at the Aldwych in the 1976 production of Ivanov, portraying Sasha.[49] She also appeared onscreen, portraying Peter Pan in the television musical film Peter Pan (1976), and as a woman haunted by the ghost a deceased girl in the horror film Full Circle (1977).[50]\nFarrow had a supporting role in Robert Altman's comedy A Wedding (1978), playing the mute daughter of a trucking company tycoon.[51] The same year, she starred with Rock Hudson in the disaster film Avalanche,[51] followed by the British Agatha Christie adaptation Death on the Nile.[52] In 1979, Farrow appeared on Broadway opposite Anthony Perkins in the play Romantic Comedy by Bernard Slade,[53][54] and in the romance film Hurricane, opposite Jason Robards.[55]\nBeginning in the 1980s, Farrow's relationship with director Woody Allen resulted in numerous film collaborations. Her first film with Allen was the comedy A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982), in a role originally intended for Diane Keaton.[56] She next appeared in Allen's Zelig (1983), portraying a psychiatrist whose patient, Leonard Zelig (Allen), takes on characteristics of those around him in an effort to be liked.[57] In Broadway Danny Rose (1984), Farrow starred as the mistress of a washed-up lounge musician who becomes involved with the mob; her character, as well as the film itself, was spurred by a real-life woman she and Allen frequently encountered while dining at Rao's, an Italian restaurant in East Harlem.[58] Farrow gained weight for the role and adopted a thick Italian accent; Allen biographer John Bailey described her as \"unrecognizable\" in the role.[58] Farrow's performance gained her critical notice, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.[33] Allen subsequently reflected that her performance was a \"very, very brave thing for her to do,\" as the majority of her scenes required her to wear sunglasses that block view of her eyes.[59] Farrow also voiced the title role in the animated film The Last Unicorn (1982).\n\u2013Woody Allen[60]\nAfter Broadway Danny Rose, Farrow had a supporting role in Jeannot Szwarc's superhero film Supergirl (1984), playing Alura In-Ze, the mother of Supergirl.[61] The film was considered a box office bomb, earning only $13 million against its $35 million budget.[62][63] Farrow reunited with Allen for 1985's The Purple Rose of Cairo, which follows a film character (portrayed by Jeff Daniels) who emerges from the screen and enters the real world, where he falls in love with a waitress (Farrow).[64] Farrow's portrayal in the film earned her a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress[65] as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.[33] Allen next cast Farrow as the lead in his drama Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), which follows a New York City family over a period of two years between two Thanksgivings.[66] In the film, Farrow starred as the titular Hannah opposite Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest (both of whom portray her sisters), and Michael Caine as her husband.[66] Released in the fall of 1986, Hannah and Her Sisters was a box-office hit, grossing $35 million in the United States during its original theatrical release.[67] The film was praised by critic Roger Ebert, who felt it was Allen's best work to date,[68] and Farrow earned her third BAFTA nomination, again in the category of Best Leading Actress.[69]\nIn 1987, Farrow appeared in two films directed by Allen: the comedy Radio Days, in which she had a supporting role as an aspiring radio star;[70] and the drama September, in which she played a woman haunted by her killing of her mother's abusive lover.[71] Farrow shot the latter film twice, originally with her real-life mother Maureen O'Sullivan playing her character's mother in the film.[71] Displeased with the final cut, Allen decided to recast several roles and reshoot the film entirely; the second and final version featured Elaine Stritch in O'Sullivan's role.[72] Farrow was subsequently cast opposite Gena Rowlands in Allen's drama Another Woman (1988), which follows a philosophy professor (Rowlands) who becomes acquainted with a troubled woman experiencing an existential crisis (Farrow).[73] While the film earned praise from critics such as Roger Ebert,[74] its screenplay and dialogue were criticized by Vincent Canby in The New York Times, who described it as \"full of an earnest teen-age writer's superfluous words.\"[75] In 1989, Farrow starred in a segment of Allen's anthology film New York Stories, playing the shiksa fianc\u00e9e of a Jewish man (Allen); she also appeared in a supporting role in Crimes and Misdemeanors as a producer who falls in love with a documentary filmmaker.[76]\nShe was next cast by Allen in his fantasy film Alice (1990), marking the couple's 11th collaboration.[77] In Alice, Farrow portrays the title character, an upper-class Manhattan woman who becomes enamored with a jazz musician; her attraction results in feelings of Catholic guilt that manifest as physical ailments which she attempts to treat with herbal medicine.[78] Vincent Canby praised her portrayal as career-defining, writing: \"Miss Farrow gives a performance that sums up and then tops all of the performances that have preceded it.\"[77] She was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical,[33] and won a National Board of Review award for Best Actress.[79] The next year, Farrow appeared as a circus performer in Allen's black-and-white comedy Shadows and Fog.[80]\nFarrow had a lead role in Allen's drama Husbands and Wives (1992), in which she portrayed the wife of a writer and professor (Allen) having an affair with one of his students.[81] Husbands and Wives marked Farrow's final collaboration with Allen, and was released shortly after the couple's highly publicized separation.[81] Todd McCarthy of Variety noted in his review of the film that much of its audience would watch it \"for the titillation of seeing Allen make out with a 21-year-old and go through a wrenching split from Farrow onscreen. Even those who enter in this frame of mind, however, probably will put these thoughts aside for the most part as they become involved in the romantic longings and verbal crossfire of a host of interesting, difficult, intersecting characters.\"[82]\nCiting the need to devote herself to raising her young children, Farrow worked less frequently during the 1990s. Nonetheless, she appeared in leading roles in several films, including the Irish film Widows' Peak (1994), in which she starred as a vengeful, matriarchal figure in a small Irish village,[83] and in the comedy Miami Rhapsody (1995), playing the mother of a single woman in her thirties (played by Sarah Jessica Parker).[84] Farrow also had a lead role in  the film adaptation of Craig Lucas's Off-Broadway play Reckless, a dark comedy in which she portrayed a woman whose husband takes a contract killing out against her.[85] Critic Stephen Holden praised her performance, writing: \"Ms. Farrow is so perfectly cast as Rachel that the character seems a distillation of nearly every role she has played since she was a teen-ager in Peyton Place.\"[85] In the spring of 1996, Farrow had an uncredited voice role in the Broadway play Getting Away with Murder, appearing in a pre-recorded voice message.[86]\nIn 1997, Farrow published her autobiography, What Falls Away,[87] and had a cameo appearance playing herself in Howard Stern's biographical comedy, Private Parts.[88] She then appeared on television in the 1998 The Wonderful World of Disney segment Miracle at Midnight, a dramatization of the Rescue of the Danish Jews during the Holocaust.[89] Will Joyner of The New York Times credited Farrow's performance in the segment as \"crucial to the production's success.\"[89] Farrow was next cast as a woman suffering Alzheimer's disease in the television film Forget Me Never.[90] Critic Steven Linan of the Los Angeles Times praised Farrow, writing that she \"convincingly conveys the fear and insecurity that accompany such a downward spiral.\"[90] Her portrayal earned her her seventh Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, in the category of Miniseries or Television Film.[33] Also in 1999, Farrow appeared in the comedy Coming Soon, playing the hippie mother of a high school student.[91]\nIn November 1999, Farrow returned to Broadway portraying Honey in a staged reading of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, opposite Matthew Broderick, Jonathan Pryce, and Uta Hagen.[92] Vincent Canby praised the production in The New York Times, writing that \"as performed by Mr. Broderick and Ms. Farrow, Nick and Honey took on dimensions I have never seen before.\"[92] The reading was subsequently staged in Los Angeles in the spring of 2000.[93]\nThe 2000s saw Farrow appearing on television, beginning with a recurring role on the series Third Watch, in which she guest-starred in five episodes between 2000 and 2003.[94] Farrow also appeared in the 2001 LGBT-themed television film A Girl Thing, opposite Kate Capshaw and Stockard Channing,[95] followed by a lead in the Lifetime film The Secret Life of Zoey in 2002.[96] She also appeared in a touring stage production of The Exonerated the same year,[97] followed by the lead in Fran's Bed, staged at Connecticut's Long Wharf Theatre in the fall of 2003.[98] She subsequently had a supporting part in the children's television film  Samantha: An American Girl Holiday (2004).[99]\nFarrow made her first feature film appearance in several years as Mrs. Baylock, a Satanic nanny, in the remake of The Omen (2006). Although the film itself received a lukewarm critical reception, Farrow's performance was widely praised, with the Associated Press declaring \"thank heaven for Mia Farrow\" and calling her performance \"a rare instance of the new Omen improving on the old one.\"[100] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer also praised her performance, describing it as \"a truly delicious comeback role... Farrow [is] chillingly believable as a sweet-talking nanny from hell.\"[101]\nFarrow subsequently appeared as the mother of a Manhattan attorney (played by Amanda Peet) in the romantic comedy The Ex (2007), also starring opposite Jason Bateman and Zach Braff.[102] The film received a largely unfavorable response from critics, with several writing that the cast's talents were underserved by the material.[103][104] She then voiced Daisy Suchot in Luc Besson's animated fantasy film Arthur and the Invisibles (2007).[105] The following year, Farrow appeared in a supporting role opposite Danny Glover in Michel Gondry's comedy Be Kind Rewind (2008), playing the friend and patron of a video store operator in suburban New Jersey.[106] She also provided voice narration for the documentary film As We Forgive (2008), which recounts the stories of two Rwandan women who confronted the individuals who murdered their families during the Rwandan genocide.[107] In 2009, Farrow reprised her voice role as Daisy Suchot in Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard,[108] and again for Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds (2010).[109] She was subsequently cast in a supporting role in the comedy-drama Dark Horse, directed by Todd Solondz,[110] in which she played the mother of a stunted 35-year-old man.[111]\nIn September 2014, Farrow returned to Broadway in the play Love Letters. The play was well-received by critics,[112] with Charles Isherwood of The New York Times deeming Farrow's performance \"utterly extraordinary\u2026\u00a0 as the flighty, unstable and writing-averse Melissa Gardner.\"[113] In 2016, Farrow appeared with Faye Dunaway in an episode of the IFC mockumentary series Documentary Now!.[114]\nFarrow became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2000 and is a high-profile advocate for human rights in Africa, particularly for children's rights. She has worked to raise funds and awareness for children in conflict-affected regions and to draw attention to the fight to eradicate polio.[4] Farrow has received several awards for her humanitarian work[115][116] including the Leon Sullivan International Service award,[117] the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award[118] and the Marion Anderson Award.[119] In 2006, Farrow and her son Ronan visited Berlin in order to participate in a charity auction of United Buddy Bears, which feature designs by artists representing 142 U.N. member states.[120] In 2008, Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.[121][2]\nShe has traveled to Darfur several times for humanitarian efforts, first in 2004.[122] Her third trip was in 2007, with a film crew engaged in making the documentary Darfur: On Our Watch.[123] The same year, she co-founded the Olympic Dream for Darfur campaign, which drew attention to China's support for the government of Sudan. The campaign hoped to change China's policy by embarrassing it in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing. In March 2007, China said it would urge Sudan to engage with the international community. The campaign persuaded Steven Spielberg to withdraw as an artistic adviser to the opening ceremony. During the Olympics, Farrow televised via the internet from a Sudanese refugee camp to highlight China's involvement in the region.[124]\nLater in 2007, Farrow offered to \"trade her freedom\" for the freedom of a humanitarian worker for the Sudan Liberation Army who was being treated in a UN hospital while under threat of arrest. She wanted to be taken captive in exchange for his being allowed to leave the country.[125] Farrow is also a board member of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Darfur Women Action Group (DWAG).[126]\nIn 2009, Farrow narrated a documentary, As We Forgive, relating the struggle of many of the survivors of the Rwandan genocide to forgive those who murdered family and friends.[127] To show \"solidarity with the people of Darfur\" Farrow began a water-only fast on April 27, 2009.[128] Farrow's goal was to fast for three weeks, but she called a halt after twelve days on the advice of her doctor.[129] In August 2010, she testified in the trial against former Liberian President Charles Taylor in the Special Court for Sierra Leone.[130]\nFarrow helped build The Darfur Archives, which document the cultural traditions of the tribes of Darfur.[131] She has filmed some 40 hours of songs, dances, children's stories, farming methods and accounts of genocide in the region's refugee camps that make up the current archives.[132] Since 2011, the Archives have been housed at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut.[133] In 2013, Farrow criticized President Barack Obama for his lack of address regarding Sudanese genocide during a United Nations General Assembly.[132] In February 2015, Farrow appeared in an episode of A Path Appears, a PBS documentary series from the creators of the Half the Sky movement. In the episode Farrow travels to Kibera, Kenya's largest slum, to share stories from organizations providing education to at-risk girls.[134][135]\nFarrow has also participated in environmental activism, in 2014 protesting against Chevron, accusing the oil company of environmental damage in the South American rainforest.[136]\nThough she has been critical of the Roman Catholic Church (such as for the Pope's failure to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda, a predominantly Catholic country), Farrow is a devout Catholic[16] and maintained in a 2013 interview with Piers Morgan that she had not \"lost her faith in God\".[137] Previously at age 23, Farrow spent part of 1968 living at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India, studying Transcendental Meditation.[138] Her visit received worldwide media attention at the time because of the presence of all four members of the Beatles, Donovan, and Mike Love, as well as her sister Prudence Farrow.[139][140]\nFarrow has stated that she has long been a registered Independent, though she has consistently voted for Democratic candidates.[141] In the 2016 Democratic presidential election, Farrow publicly endorsed Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders,[142][143] though she subsequently stated that \"as a pragmatist\" she planned to vote for Hillary Clinton.[141]\nOn July 19, 1966,[144] she married singer Frank Sinatra at the Las Vegas home of Jack Entratter.[145][146] Farrow was 21 years old, Sinatra 50.[28] Sinatra wanted Farrow to give up her acting career, which she initially agreed to do.[145] She accompanied Sinatra while he was shooting several films, but soon tired of doing nothing and signed on to star in Rosemary's Baby. Filming of Rosemary's Baby ran over its initial schedule, which angered Sinatra, who had cast Farrow in a role in his film The Detective (1968). After Farrow failed to report for filming, Sinatra cast actress Jacqueline Bisset in Farrow's role.[147] In November 1967, while Farrow was filming Rosemary's Baby, Sinatra's lawyer served her with divorce papers.[148] Their divorce was finalized in August 1968.[149] Farrow later blamed the demise of the marriage on their age difference, and said she was an \"impossibly immature teenager\" when she married Sinatra.[150][151] The two remained friends until Sinatra's death.[148]\nOn September 10, 1970, Farrow married conductor and composer Andr\u00e9 Previn in London; she was 25 and he was 41.[152] Farrow had begun a relationship with Previn while he was still married to his second wife, songwriter Dory Previn. When Farrow became pregnant, Previn left Dory and filed for divorce. Farrow gave birth to twin sons in February 1970,[152] and Previn's divorce from Dory became final in July 1970.[153] Dory Previn later wrote a scathing song, titled \"Beware of Young Girls\", about the loss of her husband to Farrow.[154] Previn and Farrow divorced in 1979.[26]\nIn 1979, Farrow began a relationship with film director Woody Allen.[155][156] During their relationship, Farrow starred in some of Allen's films, and several of her relatives also made appearances.[156] Their relationship ended in 1992 when Allen\u2019s intimate relationship with Soon-Yi Previn (Farrow's adopted daughter) who was 22 years old at the time became publicized.[157]\nFarrow and former husband Andr\u00e9 Previn have three biological children: twins Matthew and Sascha (born February 26, 1970),[159] and Fletcher (born March 14, 1974).[160] Sascha is a graduate of Fordham University,[161] while Fletcher, a graduate of Connecticut College, became the chief information officer of IBM.[162] Farrow and Previn adopted Vietnamese infants Lark Song Previn and Summer \"Daisy\" Song Previn, in 1973 and 1976, respectively,[163] followed by the adoption of Soon-Yi from Korea around 1978. Soon-Yi's precise  birth date is not known, but a bone scan estimated her age as between 5 and 7 at the time of her adoption.[157]\nThe Seoul Family Court established a Family Census Register (legal birth document) in her behalf on December 28, 1976, with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970.[164][165]\nIn 1980, following her divorce from Previn, Farrow as a single mother adopted Moses Farrow, a two-year-old Korean orphan with cerebral palsy.[161]  In 1985, Farrow adopted Dylan Farrow (born July 1985, adopted at two weeks old).[166] Dylan was known as \"Eliza\" for some time and also as \"Malone\".[167][144] In December 1991, a New York City court allowed Woody Allen to co-adopt Dylan and Moses.[168]\nWith Allen, Farrow gave birth to her fourth and final biological child, son Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow (later known simply as Ronan Farrow),[3] on December 19, 1987.[169] In a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Farrow stated Ronan could \"possibly\" be the biological child of Frank Sinatra, with whom she claimed to have \"never really split up\".[170] In a 2015 CBS Sunday Morning\u00a0interview, Sinatra's daughter Nancy dismissed the idea that her father is also the biological father of Ronan Farrow, calling it \"nonsense\". She said that her children were affected by the rumor because they were being questioned about it. \"I was kind of cranky with Mia for even saying 'possibly', she added. \"I was cranky with her for saying that because she knew better, you know, she really did. But she was making a joke! And it was taken very serious and was just silly, stupid.\"[171]\nBetween 1992 and 1995, Farrow adopted five more children: Tam Farrow; Kaeli-Shea Farrow, later known as Quincy Maureen Farrow; Frankie-Minh; Isaiah Justus; and Gabriel Wilk Farrow, later known as Thaddeus Wilk Farrow[172] and named after Elliott Wilk, the judge who oversaw Farrow's 1993 legal battle with Allen.[173]\nTam Farrow died of heart failure in 2000 at the age of 21 after a long illness.[174] In May 2018, Moses Farrow made claims on his personal blog that Tam had actually died from a prescription medication overdose following a lifelong battle with depression.[175] On December 25, 2008, Lark Previn died at the age of 35, also after a long illness.[176] Moses claimed that Lark's death was due to AIDS-related illness, following a long battle with addiction.[175] On September 21, 2016, Thaddeus Farrow was found dead at the age of 27 after an apparent car crash in Connecticut,[177] though it was subsequently ruled he had committed suicide by shooting himself in the torso while inside his car.[178]\nAccording to court testimony, on August 4, 1992, Allen visited Farrow's farm in Bridgewater, Connecticut, while she was out grocery shopping.[157] The following day, August 5, a babysitter informed Farrow that she had witnessed Allen behaving strangely with the couple's then-seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan.[157] When Farrow asked Dylan about the alleged incident, Dylan responded that Allen had touched her \"private part\" while the two were alone in the attic of the home.[157] One of the women employed to care for Farrow's children claimed that for around 20 minutes that afternoon she had not known where Dylan was, while a second said that, at one point, she noticed Dylan had been wearing no underwear beneath her dress.[179] Farrow reported the incident to the family's pediatrician, who in turn reported the allegations to authorities.[157] Allen was informed of the accusations on August 6. A week later, on August 13, Allen sued for full custody of his biological son, Satchel, and two of Farrow's adopted children, Dylan and Moses, with whom Allen had assumed a parental role.[180][181]\nIn March 1993, the lead doctor of Yale New Haven Hospital Child Sexual Abuse Clinic, Dr. John Leventhal, gave sworn testimony via a deposition that,[182] in his opinion, Dylan \"either invented the story under the stress of living in a volatile and unhealthy home or that it was planted in her mind by her mother\" because of the \"inconsistent\" presentation of the story by Dylan.[183] Leventhal did not meet with Dylan prior to giving his testimony, and instead delivered his findings based on interviews conducted by others.[180] The Yale New Haven Hospital team's findings were criticized by the presiding judge, and later by other experts in the field, who found their behavior unusual for making conclusive statements about innocence and guilt, instead of reporting on behavior, for refusing to testify in court when asked, and for destroying all of their notes.[184][185] Justice Wilk stated that the investigating team's behavior had \"resulted in a report which was sanitized and, therefore, less credible\" and that its recommendations and statements had \"exceed[ed] its mandate.\" He concluded, \"I am less certain, however, than is the Yale-New Haven team, that the evidence proves conclusively that there was no sexual abuse.\"[181]\nIn his final decision, in June 1993, Justice Wilk stated that he found \"no credible evidence to support Mr. Allen's contention that Ms. Farrow coached Dylan or that Ms. Farrow acted upon a desire for revenge against him for seducing Soon-Yi. Mr. Allen's resort to the stereotypical 'woman scorned' defense is an injudicious attempt to divert attention from his failure to act as a responsible parent and adult.\"[180] He rejected Allen's bid for full custody and denied him visitation rights with Dylan, stating that even though the full truth of the allegations may never be known, \"the credible testimony of Ms. Farrow, Dr. Coates, Dr. Leventhal and Mr. Allen does, however, prove that Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.\"[181] In September 1993, the state's attorney, Frank Maco, announced he would not pursue Allen in court for the molestation allegations, despite having \"probable cause,\" citing his and Farrow's desire not to traumatize Dylan further.[186]\nIn 2013, Moses Farrow publicly asserted that Mia had coached her children into believing stories she made up about Allen.[187][188] In February 2014, Dylan publicly renewed her claims of sexual abuse against Allen, in an open letter published by Nicholas Kristof, a friend of Farrow, in his New York Times blog.[189][190][191] Allen repeated his denial of the allegations.[192][193] In May 2018, Moses published a blog post expressing his father's innocence, stating that, \"I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.\"[175] Soon-Yi Previn echoed these claims in September 2018 in an article written by Daphne Merkin.[194] Moses also alleged in his response that Mia had physically abused him with spankings and other punishment during his childhood.[195]\nInformational\nInterviews and articles\n</body></html>"

He is the recipient of three Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards, one for acting in Syriana (2006) and the other for co-producing Argo (2012). In 2018, he was the recipient of the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award.[2] Clooney made his acting debut on television in 1978, and later gained wide recognition in his role as Dr. Doug Ross on the medical drama ER from 1994 to 1999, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. While working on ER, he began attracting a variety of leading roles in films, with his breakthrough role in From Dusk till Dawn (1996),[3][4] and the crime comedy Out of Sight (1998), in which he first worked with director Steven Soderbergh, who would become a long-time collaborator. In 1999, he took the lead role in Three Kings, a well-received war satire set during the Gulf War. In 2001, Clooney's fame widened with the release of his biggest commercial success, the heist comedy remake Ocean's Eleven, the first of what became a trilogy, starring Clooney. He made his directorial debut a year later with the biographical spy comedy Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and has since directed the historical drama Good Night, and Good Luck (2005), the sports comedy Leatherheads (2008), the political drama The Ides of March (2011), and the war film The Monuments Men (2014). Clooney won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the Middle East thriller Syriana (2005), and subsequently earned Best Actor nominations for the legal thriller Michael Clayton (2007) and the comedy-dramas Up in the Air (2009) and The Descendants (2011). In 2013, he received the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing the political thriller Argo. He has been nominated for Oscars in six different categories, a record he shares with Walt Disney.[5][6] In 2009, Clooney was included in Time's annual Time 100 as one of the \"Most Influential People in the World\".[7] He is also noted for his political and economic activism, and has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since January 31, 2008.[8][9][10] Clooney is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[11] He is married to human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney was born on May 6, 1961 in Lexington, Kentucky.[12][13] His mother, Nina Bruce (n\u00e9e Warren),[14] was a beauty queen and city councilwoman. His father, Nick Clooney, is a former anchorman and television host, including five years on the AMC network.[15] Clooney is of Irish, German, and English ancestry.[16] His maternal great-great-great-great-grandmother, Mary Ann Sparrow, was the half-sister of Nancy Lincoln, mother of President Abraham Lincoln.[17][18][19] Clooney has an older sister named Adelia (known as Ada).[20] Cabaret singer and actress Rosemary Clooney was an aunt.[12] Through Rosemary, his cousins include actors Miguel Ferrer, Rafael Ferrer, and Gabriel Ferrer, who is married to singer Debby Boone.[21] Clooney was raised a strict Roman Catholic[22] but said in 2006 that he did not know if he believed \"in Heaven, or even God.\"[23] He has said, \"Yes, we were Catholic, big-time, whole family, whole group.\"[24] He began his education at the Blessed Sacrament School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He attended St. Michael's School in Worthington, Ohio; then Western Row Elementary School (a public school) in Mason, Ohio, from 1968 to 1974; and St. Susanna School in Mason, where he served as an altar boy. The Clooneys moved back to Kentucky when George was midway through the seventh grade.[25] In middle school, Clooney developed Bell's palsy, a medical condition that partially paralyzes the face. The malady went away within a year. In an interview with Larry King, he stated that \"yes, it goes away. It takes about nine months to go away. It was the first year of high school, which was a bad time for having half your face paralyzed.\"[24] He also described one positive outcome of the condition: \"It's probably a great thing that it happened to me because it forced me to engage in a series of making fun of myself. And I think that's an important part of being famous. The practical jokes have to be aimed at you.\"[26] After his parents moved to Augusta, Kentucky, Clooney attended Augusta High School. He has stated that he earned all As and a B in school,[12] and played baseball and basketball. He tried out to play professional baseball with the Cincinnati Reds in 1977, but he did not pass the first round of player cuts and was not offered a contract.[27] He attended Northern Kentucky University from 1979 to 1981, majoring in broadcast journalism, and very briefly attended the University of Cincinnati, but did not graduate from either.[28] He earned money selling women's shoes, insurance door-to-door, stocking shelves, working in construction, and cutting tobacco.[23][29] Clooney's first role was as an extra in the television mini-series Centennial in 1978, which was based on the novel of the same name by James A. Michener and was partly filmed in Clooney's hometown of Augusta, Kentucky.[30][31] Clooney's first major role came in 1984 in the short-lived sitcom E/R (not to be confused with ER, the better-known hospital drama, on which Clooney also co-starred a decade later). He played a handyman on the series The Facts of Life and appeared as Bobby Hopkins, a detective, on an episode of The Golden Girls. His first prominent role was a semi-regular supporting role in the sitcom Roseanne, playing Roseanne Barr's supervisor Booker Brooks, followed by the role of a construction worker on Baby Talk, a co-starring role on the CBS drama Bodies of Evidence as Detective Ryan Walker, and then a year-long turn as Det. James Falconer on Sisters.

He followed its success with the romantic comedy One Fine Day with Michelle Pfeiffer, and the action-thriller The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman. Clooney was then cast as Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which was a modest box office performer, but a critical failure (with Clooney himself calling the film \"a waste of money\").[40] In 1998, he co-starred in the crime-comedy Out of Sight opposite Jennifer Lopez, marking the first of his many collaborations with director Steven Soderbergh.[41] He also starred in Three Kings during the last weeks of his contract with ER.[42] After leaving ER, Clooney starred in the commercially successful films The Perfect Storm (2000), a disaster drama; and O Brother, Where Art Thou?

Clooney lost an arbitration vote 2\u20131, and withdrew from the union over the decision. He became a \"financial core status\" non-member, meaning he no longer has voting rights, and cannot run for office or attend membership meetings, according to the WGA's constitution.[52] He next co-starred with Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey in the war comedy film The Men Who Stare at Goats, which was directed by Heslov and released in November 2009.

International support should be sought immediately for denying debt relief, expanding the ICC indictments, diplomatically isolating the regime, suspending all non-humanitarian aid, obstructing state-controlled bank transactions and freezing accounts holding oil wealth diverted by senior regime officials.[93] On March 16, 2012, Clooney was arrested outside the Sudanese Embassy for civil disobedience.[94][95] He intended to be arrested when he planned the protest.[95] Several other prominent participants were also arrested, including Martin Luther King III.[95] Clooney has been described as one of the most strident critics of Omar al-Bashir.[96] Clooney supports the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

He is the recipient of three Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards, one for acting in Syriana (2006) and the other for co-producing Argo (2012). In 2018, he was the recipient of the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award.[2]\nClooney made his acting debut on television in 1978, and later gained wide recognition in his role as Dr. Doug Ross on the medical drama ER from 1994 to 1999, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. While working on ER, he began attracting a variety of leading roles in films, with his breakthrough role in From Dusk till Dawn (1996),[3][4] and the crime comedy Out of Sight (1998), in which he first worked with director Steven Soderbergh, who would become a long-time collaborator. In 1999, he took the lead role in Three Kings, a well-received war satire set during the Gulf War.\nIn 2001, Clooney's fame widened with the release of his biggest commercial success, the heist comedy remake Ocean's Eleven, the first of what became a trilogy, starring Clooney. He made his directorial debut a year later with the biographical spy comedy Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and has since directed the historical drama Good Night, and Good Luck (2005), the sports comedy Leatherheads (2008), the political drama The Ides of March (2011), and the war film The Monuments Men (2014). Clooney won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the Middle East thriller Syriana (2005), and subsequently earned Best Actor nominations for the legal thriller Michael Clayton (2007) and the comedy-dramas Up in the Air (2009) and The Descendants (2011). In 2013, he received the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing the political thriller Argo. He has been nominated for Oscars in six different categories, a record he shares with Walt Disney.[5][6]\nIn 2009, Clooney was included in Time's annual Time 100 as one of the \"Most Influential People in the World\".[7] He is also noted for his political and economic activism, and has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since January 31, 2008.[8][9][10] Clooney is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[11] He is married to human rights lawyer Amal Clooney.\nClooney was born on May 6, 1961 in Lexington, Kentucky.[12][13] His mother, Nina Bruce (n\u00e9e Warren),[14] was a beauty queen and city councilwoman. His father, Nick Clooney, is a former anchorman and television host, including five years on the AMC network.[15] Clooney is of Irish, German, and English ancestry.[16] His maternal great-great-great-great-grandmother, Mary Ann Sparrow, was the half-sister of Nancy Lincoln, mother of President Abraham Lincoln.[17][18][19] Clooney has an older sister named Adelia (known as Ada).[20] Cabaret singer and actress Rosemary Clooney was an aunt.[12] Through Rosemary, his cousins include actors Miguel Ferrer, Rafael Ferrer, and Gabriel Ferrer, who is married to singer Debby Boone.[21]\nClooney was raised a strict Roman Catholic[22] but said in 2006 that he did not know if he believed \"in Heaven, or even God.\"[23] He has said, \"Yes, we were Catholic, big-time, whole family, whole group.\"[24] He began his education at the Blessed Sacrament School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He attended St. Michael's School in Worthington, Ohio; then Western Row Elementary School (a public school) in Mason, Ohio, from 1968 to 1974; and St. Susanna School in Mason, where he served as an altar boy. The Clooneys moved back to Kentucky when George was midway through the seventh grade.[25] In middle school, Clooney developed Bell's palsy, a medical condition that partially paralyzes the face. The malady went away within a year. In an interview with Larry King, he stated that \"yes, it goes away. It takes about nine months to go away. It was the first year of high school, which was a bad time for having half your face paralyzed.\"[24] He also described one positive outcome of the condition: \"It's probably a great thing that it happened to me because it forced me to engage in a series of making fun of myself. And I think that's an important part of being famous. The practical jokes have to be aimed at you.\"[26]\nAfter his parents moved to Augusta, Kentucky, Clooney attended Augusta High School. He has stated that he earned all As and a B in school,[12] and played baseball and basketball. He tried out to play professional baseball with the Cincinnati Reds in 1977, but he did not pass the first round of player cuts and was not offered a contract.[27] He attended Northern Kentucky University from 1979 to 1981, majoring in broadcast journalism, and very briefly attended the University of Cincinnati, but did not graduate from either.[28] He earned money selling women's shoes, insurance door-to-door, stocking shelves, working in construction, and cutting tobacco.[23][29]\nClooney's first role was as an extra in the television mini-series Centennial in 1978, which was based on the novel of the same name by James A. Michener and was partly filmed in Clooney's hometown of Augusta, Kentucky.[30][31] Clooney's first major role came in 1984 in the short-lived sitcom E/R (not to be confused with ER, the better-known hospital drama, on which Clooney also co-starred a decade later). He played a handyman on the series The Facts of Life and appeared as Bobby Hopkins, a detective, on an episode of The Golden Girls. His first prominent role was a semi-regular supporting role in the sitcom Roseanne, playing Roseanne Barr's supervisor Booker Brooks, followed by the role of a construction worker on Baby Talk, a co-starring role on the CBS drama Bodies of Evidence as Detective Ryan Walker, and then a year-long turn as Det. James Falconer on Sisters. In 1988, Clooney played a small role in the comedy-horror film Return of the Killer Tomatoes.[32] In 1990, he starred in the short-lived ABC police drama Sunset Beat.[33] During this period, Clooney was a student at the Beverly Hills Playhouse acting school for five years.[34]\nClooney rose to fame when he played Dr. Doug Ross, alongside Anthony Edwards, Julianna Margulies, and Noah Wyle, on the hit NBC medical drama ER from 1994 to 1999. After leaving the series in 1999, he made a cameo appearance in the 6th season and returned for a guest spot in the show's final season.[35] For his work on the series, Clooney received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1995 and 1996.[36][37] He also earned three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama in 1995, 1996, and 1997 (losing to co-star Anthony Edwards).[38][39]\nClooney began appearing in films while working on ER. His first major Hollywood role was in the horror comedy-crime thriller From Dusk till Dawn, directed by Robert Rodriguez and co-starring Harvey Keitel. He followed its success with the romantic comedy One Fine Day with Michelle Pfeiffer, and the action-thriller The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman. Clooney was then cast as Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman &amp; Robin, which was a modest box office performer, but a critical failure (with Clooney himself calling the film \"a waste of money\").[40] In 1998, he co-starred in the crime-comedy Out of Sight opposite Jennifer Lopez, marking the first of his many collaborations with director Steven Soderbergh.[41] He also starred in Three Kings during the last weeks of his contract with ER.[42]\nAfter leaving ER, Clooney starred in the commercially successful films The Perfect Storm (2000), a disaster drama; and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), a Coen brothers adventure comedy. In 2001, he teamed up with Soderbergh again for the heist comedy Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960s Rat Pack film of the same name, with Clooney playing Danny Ocean, originally portrayed by Frank Sinatra. It is Clooney's most successful film with him in the lead role, earning $451\u00a0million worldwide (he appeared, but did not star, in Gravity, which has a $723 million worldwide box office).[44][45] The film inspired two sequels starring Clooney, Ocean's Twelve in 2004[46] and Ocean's Thirteen in 2007.[47]\nIn 2001, Clooney and Soderbergh co-founded Section Eight Productions, for which Grant Heslov was president of television. Clooney made his directorial debut in the 2002 film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, based on the autobiography of TV producer Chuck Barris. Though the film did not do well at the box office, critics stated that Clooney's directing showed promise.[48]\nIn 2005, Clooney starred in Syriana, which was based loosely on former Central Intelligence Agency agent Robert Baer's memoirs of his service in the Middle East. Clooney suffered an accident on the set of Syriana, which caused a brain injury with complications from a punctured dura.[49] The same year he directed, produced, and starred in Good Night, and Good Luck, a film about 1950s television journalist Edward R. Murrow's famous war of words with Senator Joseph McCarthy. At the 2006 Academy Awards, Clooney was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Good Night, and Good Luck, as well as Best Supporting Actor for Syriana. He won the Oscar for his role in Syriana.[50]\nClooney next appeared in The Good German (2006), a film noir directed by Soderbergh that is set in post-World War II Germany. In August 2006, Clooney and Heslov started the production company Smokehouse Pictures. In October 2006, Clooney received the American Cinematheque Award, which honors someone in the entertainment industry who has made \"a significant contribution to the art of motion pictures\".[51] On January 22, 2008, Clooney was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for Michael Clayton (2007) but did not win. Later that year, he directed his third film, Leatherheads, in which he also starred. On April 4, 2008, Variety reported that Clooney had quietly resigned from the Writers Guild of America over a dispute concerning Leatherheads. Clooney, who is the director, producer, and star of the film, claimed that he had contributed in writing \"all but two scenes\" of it, and requested a writing credit alongside Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly, who had worked on the screenplay for 17 years. Clooney lost an arbitration vote 2\u20131, and withdrew from the union over the decision. He became a \"financial core status\" non-member, meaning he no longer has voting rights, and cannot run for office or attend membership meetings, according to the WGA's constitution.[52]\nHe next co-starred with Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey in the war comedy film The Men Who Stare at Goats, which was directed by Heslov and released in November 2009. Also in November 2009, he voiced the title character in Wes Anderson's animated feature Fantastic Mr. Fox. The same year, Clooney starred in the comedy-drama Up in the Air, which was initially given limited release, and then wide-released on December 25, 2009. For his performance in the film, which was directed by Jason Reitman, he was nominated for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA, and an Academy Award.[53] 2010 saw the release of The American, based on the novel A Very Private Gentleman by Martin Booth and directed by Anton Corbijn. Clooney played the lead role, and was a producer of the film.[54]\nAs of 2011[update], Clooney is represented by Bryan Lourd, co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency (CAA).[55] In 2011 Clooney starred in The Descendants as a husband whose wife has an accident that leaves her in a coma. He earned critical praise for his work, and won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama. Also, he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor, and the Academy Award for Best Actor. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for the political drama The Ides of March.\nIn 2013, Clooney won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, the BAFTA Award for Best Picture and the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing Argo. He is the only person in Academy Award history to be nominated for Oscars in six different categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay.[56]\nClooney co-starred with Sandra Bullock in Gravity (2013), a space thriller directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n.[57] He co-wrote, directed and starred in The Monuments Men, an adaption of The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History by Robert M. Edsel.[58] Clooney also produced August: Osage County (2013), an adaptation of the play of the same name. The film stars Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts.[59] His next film was Tomorrowland (2015), a science fiction adventure film in which he played Frank Walker, an inventor.[60] Later in the year, he was featured as himself in the Netflix Christmas musical comedy A Very Murray Christmas, starring Bill Murray.[61]\nHail, Caesar!, a comedy from the Coen brothers set in the Hollywood film industry in the 1950s, premiered in February 2016.

In April 2006, he spent ten days in Chad and Sudan with his father to make the TV special \"A Journey to Darfur\" reflecting the situation of Darfur's refugees, and advocated for action. The documentary was broadcast on American cable TV as well as in the UK and France. In 2008, it was released on DVD with the sale proceeds being donated to the International Rescue Committee.[82][83][84][85] In September of the same year, he spoke to the UN Security Council with Nobel Prize-winner Elie Wiesel to ask the UN to find a solution to the conflict and to help the people of Darfur.[86] In December, he visited China and Egypt with Don Cheadle and two Olympic winners to ask both governments to pressure Sudan's government.[87]\nOn March 25, 2007, he sent an open letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, calling on the European Union to take \"decisive action\" in the region given the failure of Sudan President Omar al-Bashir to respond to UN resolutions.[88] He narrated and was co-executive producer of the 2007 documentary Sand and Sorrow.[89] Clooney also appeared in the documentary film Darfur Now, a call-to-action film released in November 2007 for people all over the world to help stop the Darfur crisis.[90] In December 2007, Clooney and fellow actor Don Cheadle received the Summit Peace Award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in Rome. In his acceptance speech, Clooney said that \"Don and I ... stand here before you as failures.

SSP aims to monitor armed activity for signs of renewed civil war between Sudan and South Sudan, and to detect and deter mass atrocities along the border regions there.[92]\nClooney and John Prendergast co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed piece in May 2011, titled \"Dancing with a dictator in Sudan\", arguing that:\nPresident Omar al-Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, is escalating bombing and food aid obstruction in Darfur, and he now threatens the entire north-south peace process ... the evidence shows that incentives alone are insufficient to change Khartoum's calculations. International support should be sought immediately for denying debt relief, expanding the ICC indictments, diplomatically isolating the regime, suspending all non-humanitarian aid, obstructing state-controlled bank transactions and freezing accounts holding oil wealth diverted by senior regime officials.[93]\nOn March 16, 2012, Clooney was arrested outside the Sudanese Embassy for civil disobedience.[94][95] He intended to be arrested when he planned the protest.[95] Several other prominent participants were also arrested, including Martin Luther King III.[95] Clooney has been described as one of the most strident critics of Omar al-Bashir.[96]\nClooney supports the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. He is one of the chief associates of the 100 Lives Initiative, a project which aims to remember the lives lost during the event.[97] As part of the initiative, Clooney launched the Aurora Prize, which awards to those who risk their lives to prevent genocides and atrocities.[97][98] Clooney had also urged various American government officials to support the United States' recognition of the Armenian Genocide.[98] Clooney visited Armenia to commemorate the 101st anniversary of the event in April 2016.[99]\nIn May 2015, Clooney told the BBC that the Syrian conflict was too complicated politically to get involved in and he wanted to focus on helping the refugees.[100] In March 2016, he and his wife, Amal Clooney, met with Syrian refugees living in Berlin to mark the fifth anniversary of the conflict, before meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to thank her for Germany's open-door policy.[101]\nIn 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the Clooneys pledged $500,000 to the March for Our Lives and said they would be in attendance.[102]\nOn March 28, 2019, Clooney wrote an open letter calling for the boycott of the Sultan of Brunei's hotels over a new law that comes into force on April 3, 2019 that will punish homosexual sex and adultery with death by stoning. Clooney lists 9 hotels including The Dorchester, 45 Park Lane, Coworth Park, The Beverly Hills Hotel, Hotel Bel-Air, Le Meurice, Hotel Plaza Athenee, Hotel Eden and Hotel Principe di Savoia and asks readers to consider how \u201cwe are putting money directly into the pockets of men who choose to stone and whip to death their own citizens for being gay or accused of adultery.\u201d[103][104]\nClooney dated actress Kelly Preston (1987\u20131989).

He called the paper \"the worst kind of tabloid. One that makes up its facts to the detriment of its readers.\"[117] On August 7, 2014, Clooney and Alamuddin obtained marriage licenses at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea of the United Kingdom.[118] Alamuddin and Clooney were officially married on September 27, 2014, at Ca' Farsetti.[119] They were married by Clooney's friend Walter Veltroni, the former mayor of Rome.[120]\nIn 2015, Clooney and Alamuddin adopted a rescue dog, a bassett hound named Millie, from the San Gabriel Valley Humane Society.[121]\nOn February 9, 2017, it was reported by the CBS talk show, The Talk, that Amal was pregnant, and that they were expecting twins.[122] On June 6, 2017, Amal gave birth to a daughter, Ella, and a son, Alexander.[123]\nClooney has property in Los Angeles.

The driver of the car reported that Clooney attempted to pass him on the right,[130] while Clooney said that the driver signaled left and then decided to make an abrupt right turn and clipped his motorcycle. On October 9, 2007, more than two dozen staff at Palisades Medical Center were suspended without pay for looking at Clooney's medical records in violation of federal law.[131]\nOn July 10, 2018, Clooney was hit by a car while riding a motorcycle to a film set in Sardinia. He was hospitalised with minor, non-life-threatening injuries.[132][133]\nGrowing up around Cincinnati, Clooney is a fan of the Cincinnati Bengals and Cincinnati Reds.[134] He tried out to be a Red in 1977.[135]\nClooney has appeared in commercials outside the U.S. for Fiat, Nespresso, Martini vermouth, and Omega.[136][137][138][139] Clooney was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[140][141][142] He is sometimes described as one of the most handsome men in the world.[143][144] In 2005, TV Guide ranked Clooney No. 1 on its \"50 Sexiest Stars of All Time\" list.[145] The cover story in a February 2008 issue of Time magazine was headlined with: \"George Clooney: The last movie star\".[146]\nHe was parodied in the South Park episode \"Smug Alert!\", which criticizes his acceptance speech at the 78th Academy Awards.[citation needed] Clooney has also lent his voice to South Park as Sparky the Dog in \"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\" and as the emergency room doctor in South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut.

                "text": "no title\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III; August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Prior to his presidency, he served as governor of Arkansas (1979\u20131981 and 1983\u20131992) and as attorney general of Arkansas (1977\u20131979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of former Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and is one of only three U.S. presidents to have been impeached.[1] The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice for the purpose of concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern. He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his term in office. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University,[2] University College, Oxford, and Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the Attorney General of Arkansas, serving from 1977 to 1979. He later served as governor of Arkansas. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. W. Bush. At age 46, he became the third-youngest president in history. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. He passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and has continually received high scores in the historical rankings of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. In addition, he secured the release of two American journalists imprisoned by North Korea, visiting the capital Pyongyang in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[3][4] He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley).[5] His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.[6] Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[4] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[4][7][8][9][10] In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[4] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[11] Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15[12] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[4] Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr.; Clinton threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.[4][13] In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[4] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[14] After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".[15] Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[4][13] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[16] With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968. In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[17] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[4] While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[18] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay,[19] a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[20] Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[21] Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[13][22][23] During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[21][24] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things\".[21] He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.[25] While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife,\" and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".[22][26] During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[27] While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969.[4] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[28] He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\".[29] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers\u00a01 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[30] Colonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[32] Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[33][34] Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[35] After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[4][13] In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[4][36] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[37] The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[38] Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[39] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[40] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[41] Bill married Hillary on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[36] After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52\u00a0percent to 48\u00a0percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[42] Clinton was elected.[13] In 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas.[43] Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\".[44][45][46] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31\u00a0percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.[13] Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[47] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system.[48] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[49] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[49][50] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[13] In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session\u2014the longest in Arkansas history.[48] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[13][49] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[42] Also in the 1980s, The Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[51] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[13][52] According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[53][54] During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976).[55] As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.[56] In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities.[57] Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored\u2014but ultimately vetoed\u2014by the First Lady).[58] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[59] and poorly delivered.[60] Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[49][61] During his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[62][63] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[64][65] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[66][67][68] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69\u00a0billion in 1998, $126\u00a0billion in 1999, and $236\u00a0billion in 2000,[69] during the last three years of Clinton's presidency.[70] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[71][72] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[73] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York, in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York. In the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[13] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish.[74] Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[13][61] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[61] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.[13] During the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[4][75] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".[76] Clinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.[53][77] Bush's approval ratings were around 80\u00a0percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[61] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40\u00a0percent.[61][78] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention\u2014with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform\u2014many moderates were alienated.[79] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[80] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[81] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\".[81] Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success.[81] Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[5] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[82][83] Inaugural address, January 20, 1993.[84] Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[85] and was popular with the public.[86] Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993\u2014the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade\u2014Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[87] Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"\u2014a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[88] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[89] On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[90] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[91] Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[92] On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[93] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[94] In August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15\u00a0million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90\u00a0percent of small businesses,[95] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2\u00a0percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.[96] On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[52] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[49][52] In November 1993, David Hale\u2014the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy\u2014alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.[97] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair. On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[52] In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\".[98] That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[99] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban\u00a0... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress\".[100] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[101] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[49] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\".[102] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[103] On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[104] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[104] The Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[105] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\"[106] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period. [107] On October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov.[108][109] The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[110][111] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011\u2014Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"[112] After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[113] The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[114] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files.[115] On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.[116] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\".[117] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\"[118] Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\".[119] Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\".[118] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\"[120] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[121] Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[122] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[123] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[124] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[125] Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[126] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[127] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[123] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[128] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[129] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[130] Bill Clinton's announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[131] The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.[132][133] Despite the evidence,[132][134] the Chinese government denied all accusations.[135] As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[136] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[137][138] Ken Gormley, author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[139] According to officials, the IED was large enough to \"blow up the entire presidential motorcade\".[140] Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[139] This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[140] Once more, the word \"wedding\" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[140] Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[141] Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[142] Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[142] The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.[140] Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[140] In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2\u00a0percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7\u00a0percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4\u00a0percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once.[143] The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70\u00a0percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes. In the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy\u2014a Democrat\u2014and Orrin Hatch\u2014a Republican\u2014teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[144] In 1999 he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[145] Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998 by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228-206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury[146] and voted 221-212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.[147] Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after Andrew Johnson) to be impeached.[148][149] Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[150] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\",[151] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998. While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.[152] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition. The Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.[153] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly.[154] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[153] and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[155] Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[153] On January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[156][157] Clinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[52][158] Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.[159] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.[160] During his presidency, Clinton and the U.S. military and diplomatic forces were involved in conflicts in several areas of the world. Clinton played a key role in peace talks in Northern Ireland and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. troops were involved in conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and other regions. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets\u2014a spectacle broadcast on television news programs.[161] In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was planned.[162] Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.[163] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\"[164] In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement. In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the UK government. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, the IRA's political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of Belfast and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during the Troubles.[165] Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks, which eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.[166] In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8\u00a0million (equivalent to $214.86\u00a0million in 2019) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[167] Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011).[168] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,[169] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".[170] In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden[171] and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.[172] To stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide)[173][174] of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[175] NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat,[176] though two died in an Apache helicopter crash.[177] Opinions in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[178][179] Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing.[180][181] In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\".[182] In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\".[183] The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.[184] Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the Kosovo war.[185] Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[185][186] In Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world\", and when I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[187] Seeking to weaken Hussein's grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[188][189] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\"[190] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[191][192] Clinton's November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War.[193] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China.[194] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[195] Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.[196] Relations were damaged for a time by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. President Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.[197] The U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000 granted China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status (previously called most favoured nation (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000 by Clinton.[198][199][200] President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China's accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets\u2014with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world\u2014to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\" said Clinton.[201] U.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by almost five million since 2000.[202] Since the entry of China into the WTO in 2001, the decline in manufacturing jobs has accelerated.[203][204] After initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days.[52] Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had \"missed the opportunity\" to facilitate a \"just and lasting peace\". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[4][205] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[52] Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[206] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[207] Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84\u00a0percent of his nominees were confirmed.[208] Sonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997, to the Second Circuit. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.[209][210] Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[211] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[212] Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams).[212] Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.[213] Throughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[214] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[215] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[216] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[217] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[217] As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45\u00a0percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55\u00a0percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68\u00a0percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58\u00a0percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\"[217] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22\u00a0percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\".[217] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics\u2014and he's done a heck of a good job.\"[218] In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[219] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[220][221] In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[222] The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[222] A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[223] As the first baby boomer president, Clinton was the first chief executive since Calvin Coolidge who was not alive during World War II.[225] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[226][227] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\".[228] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[229] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[229] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency.[230] Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88\u00a0m), Clinton is tied with five others as the fifth-tallest president in the nation's history.[231][232] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba, especially in the South.[233] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\".[234][235] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[236][237] Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[238] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first Black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\".[239] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure.[239] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large.[240] Clinton, a Baptist,[241] has been open about his faith.[242] Shortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a conservative newspaper owner, began to underwrite investigations into Clinton's past, reportedly with the hope of discovering a scandal which would cost him his presidency.[243] Leading the Arkansas Project, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton's home state of Arkansas who would be able to reveal hidden misconduct of the president.[243] Clinton was a friend of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein.[244] Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.[245][246][247] In 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[248] Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[249] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[250] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[251] Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[252] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[253] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky\u2014a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[254] In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[255] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[256] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[257] Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[258] Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.[259] To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press.[260] Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition.[259] In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.[259] The Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998.[261] In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.[262] During the 2018 Congressional elections, no Democratic candidate for office asked Clinton to campaign with him or her, a change that The New York Times attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.[261] Clinton boarded the Lolita Express, a private plane of registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, at least 26 times.[263][264] Flight records indicate that underage girls and young women, such as Chauntae Davies, who were told to do whatever Epstein asks, were present on the plane the majority of the times Clinton boarded the plane.[265][266][267] Epstein has claimed he co-founded the Clinton Foundation.[268] Clinton has denied knowing anything about the Lolita Express or about Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse, despite it being public record.[269][270] Bill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations,[271] and has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention.[272] In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[273][274] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[275] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[276] The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004.[277] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life, in 2004.[278] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[279] In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[280] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[281] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[282] and traveled to the affected areas.[283] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[284] Based on his philanthropic worldview,[285] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[286] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.[287] Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[288] The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[289] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30\u00a0percent in developing nations.[290] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[291] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10\u00a0million toward her campaign.[292] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[293] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[294] Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[295] Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\".[296] After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[297][298] In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[299] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[299] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[300][301] Since then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages.[302] Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\".[303] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery.[304] Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant.[303] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation.[305][306] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[307] During the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina.[308] In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[309] On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[310] In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.[311] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.[312] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.[311][313] After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[314] The Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency, which were paid off four years after he left office.[315] Bill and Hillary Clinton have each received millions of dollars in book authorship fees.[316] In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240\u00a0million in the 15\u00a0years from January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing).[317] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153\u00a0million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[318] In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25\u00a0million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5\u00a0million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period.[319] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5\u00a0million and $25.5\u00a0million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17\u00a0million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[320] Clinton earned more than $104\u00a0million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[321] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100\u00a0million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, The New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns[322] show they made $109\u00a0million in the eight years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92\u00a0million from his speaking and book-writing.[316][323][324][325] Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[318][326][327][328] Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.[329][330] Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education.\" She added, \"Bill has worked really hard\u00a0... we had to pay off all our debts\u00a0... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.\"[324] Various colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees[331][332] and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.[333] He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there.[334][335] Schools have been named for Clinton,[336][337][338] and statues have been built to pay him homage.[339][340] U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[341] Arkansas,[342] Kentucky,[343] and New York.[344] He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001.[345] The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in his honor on December 5, 2001.[346] He has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic,[347] Papua New Guinea,[348] Germany,[349] and Kosovo.[339] The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[350][351][352] Clinton was selected as Time's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992,[353] and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr.[354] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century.[355] He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[356] a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[357] and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.[358] In 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross \"for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010\". Clinton declared at the ceremony that \"in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise\".[359] U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[360] Bill Clinton is one of the narrators on a 2003 recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, on Pentatone, together with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren.

Prior to his presidency, he served as governor of Arkansas (1979\u20131981 and 1983\u20131992) and as attorney general of Arkansas (1977\u20131979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of former Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and is one of only three U.S. presidents to have been impeached.[1] The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice for the purpose of concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern. He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his term in office.\nClinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University,[2] University College, Oxford, and Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the Attorney General of Arkansas, serving from 1977 to 1979. He later served as governor of Arkansas. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. W. Bush. At age 46, he became the third-youngest president in history.\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. He passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\nClinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and has continually received high scores in the historical rankings of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. In addition, he secured the release of two American journalists imprisoned by North Korea, visiting the capital Pyongyang in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.\nClinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[3][4] He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley).[5] His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.[6] Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[4] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[4][7][8][9][10] In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[4] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[11]\nAlthough he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15[12] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[4] Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr.; Clinton threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.[4][13]\n\nIn Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[4] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[14] After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".[15]\nClinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[4][13] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[16]\nWith the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968.\nIn 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[17] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[4] While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[18] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay,[19] a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[20]\nUpon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[21] Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[13][22][23]\nDuring his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[21][24] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things\".[21] He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.[25]\nWhile Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife,\" and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".[22][26]\nDuring the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[27] While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969.[4] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[28]\nHe subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\".[29] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers\u00a01 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[30]\nColonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[32] Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[33][34] Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[35]\nAfter Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[4][13] In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[4][36] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[37] The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[38]\nClinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[39] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[40] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[41]\nBill married Hillary on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[36]\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52\u00a0percent to 48\u00a0percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[42] Clinton was elected.[13]\nIn 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas.[43] Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\".[44][45][46] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31\u00a0percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.[13]\nClinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[47] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system.[48] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[49] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[49][50] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[13]\nIn the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session\u2014the longest in Arkansas history.[48] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[13][49] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[42]\nAlso in the 1980s, The Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[51] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[13][52]\nAccording to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[53][54] During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976).[55] As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.[56]\nIn 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities.[57] Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored\u2014but ultimately vetoed\u2014by the First Lady).[58] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[59] and poorly delivered.[60] Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[49][61]\nDuring his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[62][63] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[64][65] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[66][67][68] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69\u00a0billion in 1998, $126\u00a0billion in 1999, and $236\u00a0billion in 2000,[69] during the last three years of Clinton's presidency.[70] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[71][72] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[73] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York, in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York.\nIn the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[13] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish.[74]\nWinning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[13][61] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[61] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.[13]\nDuring the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[4][75] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".[76]\nClinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.[53][77]\nBush's approval ratings were around 80\u00a0percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[61] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40\u00a0percent.[61][78] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention\u2014with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform\u2014many moderates were alienated.[79] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[80] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[81] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\".[81]\nClinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success.[81] Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[5] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[82][83]\nInaugural address, January 20, 1993.[84]\nClinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[85] and was popular with the public.[86]\nTwo days after taking office, on January 22, 1993\u2014the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade\u2014Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[87] Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"\u2014a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[88] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[89]\nOn February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[90] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[91] Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[92]\nOn May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[93] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[94]\nIn August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15\u00a0million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90\u00a0percent of small businesses,[95] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2\u00a0percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.[96]\nOn September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[52] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[49][52]\nIn November 1993, David Hale\u2014the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy\u2014alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.[97] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.\nOn November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[52]\nIn December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\".[98]\nThat month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[99] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban\u00a0... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress\".[100] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[101] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[49] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\".[102] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[103]\nOn January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[104] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[104]\nThe Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[105] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\"[106] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period. [107]\nOn October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov.[108][109] The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[110][111] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011\u2014Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"[112]\nAfter two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[113]\nThe White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[114] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files.[115]\nOn September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.[116] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\".[117] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\"[118] Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\".[119] Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\".[118] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\"[120] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[121]\nDespite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[122] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[123] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[124] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[125] Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[126] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[127] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[123] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[128] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[129] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[130]\nBill Clinton's announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[131]\nThe 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.[132][133] Despite the evidence,[132][134] the Chinese government denied all accusations.[135]\nAs part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[136] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[137][138]\nKen Gormley, author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[139] According to officials, the IED was large enough to \"blow up the entire presidential motorcade\".[140] Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[139] This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[140] Once more, the word \"wedding\" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[140] Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[141] Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[142] Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[142] The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.[140] Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[140]\nIn the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2\u00a0percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7\u00a0percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4\u00a0percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once.[143] The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70\u00a0percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.\nIn the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy\u2014a Democrat\u2014and Orrin Hatch\u2014a Republican\u2014teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[144] In 1999 he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[145]\nClinton was impeached on December 19, 1998 by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228-206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury[146] and voted 221-212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.[147] Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after Andrew Johnson) to be impeached.[148][149] Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[150] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\",[151] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998.\nWhile the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.[152] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.\nThe Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.[153] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly.[154] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[153] and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[155] Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[153]\nOn January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[156][157]\nClinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[52][158] Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.[159] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.[160]\nDuring his presidency, Clinton and the U.S. military and diplomatic forces were involved in conflicts in several areas of the world. Clinton played a key role in peace talks in Northern Ireland and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. troops were involved in conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and other regions.\nThe Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets\u2014a spectacle broadcast on television news programs.[161] In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.\nIn April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was planned.[162] Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.[163] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\"[164]\nIn 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.\nIn 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the UK government. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, the IRA's political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of Belfast and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during the Troubles.[165] Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks, which eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.[166]\nIn February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8\u00a0million (equivalent to $214.86\u00a0million in 2019) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[167]\nCapturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011).[168] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,[169] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".[170]\nIn response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden[171] and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.[172]\nTo stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide)[173][174] of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[175] NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat,[176] though two died in an Apache helicopter crash.[177] Opinions in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[178][179] Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing.[180][181] In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\".[182] In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\".[183] The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.[184] Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the Kosovo war.[185] Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[185][186]\n\nIn Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world\", and when I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[187]\nSeeking to weaken Hussein's grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[188][189] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\"[190] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[191][192]\nClinton's November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War.[193] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China.[194] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[195] Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.[196]\nRelations were damaged for a time by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. President Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.[197]\nThe U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000 granted China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status (previously called most favoured nation (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000 by Clinton.[198][199][200] President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China's accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets\u2014with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world\u2014to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\" said Clinton.[201]\nU.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by almost five million since 2000.[202] Since the entry of China into the WTO in 2001, the decline in manufacturing jobs has accelerated.[203][204]\nAfter initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days.[52] Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had \"missed the opportunity\" to facilitate a \"just and lasting peace\". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[4][205] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[52]\nClinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[206] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[207]\nAlong with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84\u00a0percent of his nominees were confirmed.[208]\nSonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997, to the Second Circuit. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.[209][210]\nClinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[211] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[212] Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams).[212] Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.[213]\nThroughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[214] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[215] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[216] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[217] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[217]\nAs he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45\u00a0percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55\u00a0percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68\u00a0percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58\u00a0percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\"[217] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22\u00a0percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\".[217] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics\u2014and he's done a heck of a good job.\"[218]\nIn May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[219] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[220][221]\nIn 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[222] The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[222]\nA 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[223]\nAs the first baby boomer president, Clinton was the first chief executive since Calvin Coolidge who was not alive during World War II.[225] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[226][227] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\".[228] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[229] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[229] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency.[230] Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88\u00a0m), Clinton is tied with five others as the fifth-tallest president in the nation's history.[231][232] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba, especially in the South.[233] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\".[234][235] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[236][237]\nClinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[238] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first Black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\".[239] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure.[239] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large.[240] Clinton, a Baptist,[241] has been open about his faith.[242]\nShortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a conservative newspaper owner, began to underwrite investigations into Clinton's past, reportedly with the hope of discovering a scandal which would cost him his presidency.[243] Leading the Arkansas Project, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton's home state of Arkansas who would be able to reveal hidden misconduct of the president.[243] Clinton was a friend of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein.[244]\nSeveral women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.[245][246][247]\nIn 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[248] Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[249] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[250] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[251] Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[252] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[253] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky\u2014a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[254]\nIn 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[255] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[256] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[257] Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[258]\nAlso in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.[259] To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press.[260] Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition.[259] In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.[259]\nThe Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998.[261] In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.[262] During the 2018 Congressional elections, no Democratic candidate for office asked Clinton to campaign with him or her, a change that The New York Times attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.[261]\nClinton boarded the Lolita Express, a private plane of registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, at least 26 times.[263][264] Flight records indicate that underage girls and young women, such as Chauntae Davies, who were told to do whatever Epstein asks, were present on the plane the majority of the times Clinton boarded the plane.[265][266][267] Epstein has claimed he co-founded the Clinton Foundation.[268] Clinton has denied knowing anything about the Lolita Express or about Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse, despite it being public record.[269][270]\nBill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations,[271] and has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention.[272]\nIn 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[273][274] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[275] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[276]\nThe William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004.[277] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life, in 2004.[278] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[279]\nIn the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[280] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[281] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[282] and traveled to the affected areas.[283] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[284]\nBased on his philanthropic worldview,[285] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[286] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.[287] Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[288] The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[289] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30\u00a0percent in developing nations.[290] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[291]\nDuring the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10\u00a0million toward her campaign.[292] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[293] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[294] Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[295] Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\".[296] After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[297][298]\nIn 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[299] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[299] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[300][301]\nSince then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages.[302] Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\".[303] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery.[304] Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant.[303] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation.[305][306] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[307]\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina.[308] In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[309]\nOn September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[310]\nIn September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.[311] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.[312] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.[311][313] After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[314]\nThe Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency, which were paid off four years after he left office.[315] Bill and Hillary Clinton have each received millions of dollars in book authorship fees.[316] In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240\u00a0million in the 15\u00a0years from January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing).[317] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153\u00a0million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[318] In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25\u00a0million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5\u00a0million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period.[319] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5\u00a0million and $25.5\u00a0million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17\u00a0million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[320] Clinton earned more than $104\u00a0million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[321] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100\u00a0million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, The New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns[322] show they made $109\u00a0million in the eight years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92\u00a0million from his speaking and book-writing.[316][323][324][325]\nBill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[318][326][327][328] Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.[329][330] Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education.\" She added, \"Bill has worked really hard\u00a0... we had to pay off all our debts\u00a0... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.\"[324]\nVarious colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees[331][332] and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.[333] He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there.[334][335] Schools have been named for Clinton,[336][337][338] and statues have been built to pay him homage.[339][340] U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[341] Arkansas,[342] Kentucky,[343] and New York.[344] He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001.[345] The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in his honor on December 5, 2001.[346]\nHe has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic,[347] Papua New Guinea,[348] Germany,[349] and Kosovo.[339] The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[350][351][352]\nClinton was selected as Time's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992,[353] and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr.[354] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century.[355] He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[356] a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[357] and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.[358]\nIn 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross \"for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010\". Clinton declared at the ceremony that \"in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise\".[359]\nU.S. President Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[360]\nBill Clinton is one of the narrators on a 2003 recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, on Pentatone, together with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren.\nOrganizations\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nJordan Bernt Peterson (born June 12, 1962) is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. His main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology,[1] with a particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief[2] and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.[3] Peterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. He was a post-doctoral fellow at McGill from 1991 to 1993 before moving to Harvard University, where he was an assistant professor in the psychology department.[4][5] In 1998, he returned to Canada to become a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, where he eventually became a full professor.[6] Peterson's first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide.[7][8][9] His second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, was published in January 2018.[4][10][11] In 2016, Peterson released a series[12] of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian government's Bill C-16, \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The act added \"gender identity and expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination,[a][13] which Peterson characterised as an introduction of compelled speech into law,[14][15][16] although legal experts have disagreed.[17] He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.[4][10][11] Several writers have associated Peterson with an \"Intellectual Dark Web\".[18][19][20][21][22] Peterson was born on June 12, 1962.[23] He grew up in Fairview, Alberta, a small town northwest of his birthplace (Edmonton).[24] He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher.[25][26] His middle name is Bernt (/\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r\u0259nt/ BAIR-\u0259nt),[27] after his Norwegian great-grandfather.[28] When Peterson was 13, he was introduced to the writings of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ayn Rand by his school librarian Sandy Notley (the mother of Rachel Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th Premier of Alberta).[29] He worked for the New Democratic Party (NDP) throughout his teenage years, but grew disenchanted with the party. He saw his experience of disillusionment resonating with Orwell's diagnosis, in The Road to Wigan Pier, of \"the intellectual, tweed-wearing middle-class socialist\" who \"didn't like the poor; they just hated the rich\".[25][30] He left the NDP at age 18.[31] After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature.[2] He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982.[31] Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe. There he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War, 20th-century European totalitarianism,[2][32] and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,[25] and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[32] He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984.[33] In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.[2][34] From July 1993 to June 1998,[1] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals.[31] Two former Ph.D. students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students.[4] In July 1998, he returned to Canada and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.[1][33] Peterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational,[1] religious, ideological,[2] political, and creativity psychology.[3] Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers[35] and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017.[36] For most of his career, Peterson had an active clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He had been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16.[12][29][37] As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017[10] and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018.[26][38] In June 2018, Peterson debated with Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver while moderated by Bret Weinstein, and again in July at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London while moderated by Douglas Murray, over the topic of religion and God.[39][40] In April 2019, Peterson debated professor Slavoj \u017di\u017eek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.[41][42] In 1999 Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs and make narratives using ideas from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and psychology in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.[31][5][43] According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in social conflict, explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification[31]) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Rwandan genocide.[31][5][43] He considers that an \"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality\".[43] Jungian archetypes play an important role in the book.[4] In 2004, a 13-part TV series based on Peterson's book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief aired on TVOntario.[25][33][44] In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. The work contains abstract ethical principles about life, in a more accessible style than Maps of Meaning.[10][4][11] To promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour.[45][46][47] As part of the tour, Peterson was interviewed in the UK by Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News which generated considerable attention, as well as popularity for the book.[48][49][50][51] The book topped bestselling lists in Canada, the US, and the United Kingdom.[52][53] As of January 2019, Peterson is working on a sequel to 12 Rules for Life.[54] In 2013, Peterson began recording his lectures (\"Personality and Its Transformations\", \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\"[55]) and uploading them to YouTube. His YouTube channel has gathered more than 1.8 million subscribers and his videos have received more than 65 million views as of August 2018.[37][56] In January 2017, he hired a production team to film his psychology lectures at the University of Toronto. He used funds received on the crowdfunding website Patreon after he became embroiled in the Bill C-16 controversy in September 2016. His funding through Patreon has increased from $1,000 per month in August 2016 to $14,000 by January 2017, more than $50,000 by July 2017, and over $80,000 by May 2018.[29][37][57][58] In December 2018, Peterson decided to delete his Patreon account after Patreon's bans of political personalities who were violating Patreon's terms of service regarding hate speech.[59][60] Peterson has appeared on many podcasts, conversational series, as well other online shows.[56][61] In December 2016, Peterson started his own podcast, The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast, which has included academic guests such as Camille Paglia, Martin Daly, and James W. Pennebaker.[62] On his YouTube channel he has interviewed Stephen Hicks, Richard J. Haier, and Jonathan Haidt among others.[62] In March 2019, the podcast joined the Westwood One network with Peterson's daughter as a co-host on some episodes.[63] Peterson supported engineer James Damore in his action against Google.[11] In May 2017, Peterson began The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,[64] a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in Book of Genesis as patterns of behavior ostensibly vital for personal, social and cultural stability.[11] In March 2019, Peterson had his invitation of a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University rescinded. He had previously said that the fellowship would give him \"the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months\", and that the new lectures would have been on Book of Exodus.[65] A spokesperson for the University said that there was \"no place\" for anyone who could not uphold the \"inclusive environment\" of the university.[66] After a week, the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope explained that it was due to a photograph with a man wearing an Islamophobic shirt.[67] The Cambridge student union released a statement of relief, considering the invitation \"a political act to ... legitimise figures such as Peterson\" and that his work and views are not \"representative of the student body\".[68] Peterson called the decision a \"deeply unfortunate ... error of judgement\" and expressed regret that the Divinity Faculty had submitted to an \"ill-informed, ignorant and ideologically-addled mob\".[69][70] In 2005, Peterson and his colleagues set up a for-profit company to provide and produce a writing therapy program with a series of online writing exercises.[71] Titled the Self Authoring Suite,[25] it includes the Past Authoring Program (a guided autobiography); two Present Authoring Programs which allow the participant to analyze their personality faults and virtues in terms of the Big Five personality model; and the Future Authoring Program which guides participants through the process of planning their desired futures. The latter program was used with McGill University undergraduates on academic probation to improve their grades, as well as since 2011 at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.[72][73] The programs were developed partially from research by James W. Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin and Gary Latham at the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto.[4] Peterson's co-authored 2015 study showed significant reduction in ethnic and gender-group differences in performance, especially among ethnic minority male students.[73][74] According to Peterson, more than 10,000 students have used the program as of January 2017, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and GPAs rising by 20%.[25] Peterson has characterized himself as a \"classic British liberal\",[32][75][76] and as a \"traditionalist\".[77] He has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right wing,[56] as, for example, The New York Times has described Peterson as \"conservative-leaning\",[78] and The Washington Post has described him as \"conservative\".[79] Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Yoram Hazony stated, \"The startling success of his elevated arguments for the importance of order has made him the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the English-speaking world in a generation.\"[80] Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs opines that Peterson has been seen \"as everything from a fascist apologist to an Enlightenment liberal, because his vacuous words are a kind of Rorschach test onto which countless interpretations can be projected.\"[81] Prominent libertarian socialist intellectual Noam Chomsky has agreed with Robinson's criticism, although he described Peterson as \"far on the right\".[82] Peterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as postmodernism, postmodern feminism, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism.[61][83] Writing in the National Post, Chris Selley said Peterson's opponents had \"underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions\",[84] while in The Spectator, Tim Lott stated Peterson became \"an outspoken critic of mainstream academia\".[32] Peterson's social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of The Globe and Mail noted: \"few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won\".[37] According to his study\u2014conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy\u2014of the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: \"PC-egalitarianism\" and \"PC-authoritarianism\", which is a manifestation of \"offense sensitivity\".[85] Jason McBride claims Peterson places classical liberals in the first type, and places so-called social justice warriors, who he says \"weaponize compassion\", in the second.[25][2] The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians.[85] Peterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe.[37] According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s. In his view the humanities have become corrupt and less reliant on science. Instead of \"intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological conversation\". From his own experience as a professor, he states that the students who are coming to his classes are uneducated about and unaware of the mass exterminations and other crimes against humanity perpetrated by Stalinism and Maoism, which were not given the same attention as fascism and Nazism. He also says that \"instead of being ennobled or inculcated into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from [the students] by post-modernism and neo-Marxism, which defines everything in terms of relativism and power\".[32][86][87] \u2014\u00a0Peterson, 2017[86] Peterson says that postmodern philosophers and sociologists since the 1960s[83] have built upon and extended certain core tenets of Marxism and communism while simultaneously appearing to disavow both ideologies. He says that it is difficult to understand contemporary Western society without considering the influence of a strain of postmodernist thought that migrated from France to the United States through the English department at Yale University. He states that certain academics in the humanities:[86] ... started to play a sleight of hand, and instead of pitting the proletariat, the working class, against the bourgeois, they started to pit the oppressed against the oppressor. That opened up the avenue to identifying any number of groups as oppressed and oppressor and to continue the same narrative under a different name.... The people who hold this doctrine\u2013this radical, postmodern, communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity or some kind of group identity paramount\u2013they've got control over most low-to-mid level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well. Peterson's perspective on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments has been compared to Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories.[50][88][89][90] Peterson says that \"disciplines like women's studies should be defunded\" and advises freshman students to avoid subjects like sociology, anthropology, English literature, ethnic studies, and racial studies, as well as other fields of study he believes are corrupted by the neo-Marxist ideology.[91][92][93] He says that these fields, under the pretense of academic inquiry, propagate unscientific methods, fraudulent peer-review processes for academic journals, publications that garner zero citations,[94] cult-like behaviour,[92] safe-spaces,[91] and radical left-wing political activism for students.[83] Peterson has proposed launching a website which uses artificial intelligence to identify and showcase the amount of ideologization in specific courses. He announced in November 2017 that he had temporarily postponed the project as \"it might add excessively to current polarization\".[95][96] Peterson has criticized the use of the term \"white privilege\", stating that \"being called out on their white privilege, identified with a particular racial group and then made to suffer the consequences of the existence of that racial group and its hypothetical crimes, and that sort of thing has to come to a stop.\u00a0... [It's] racist in its extreme\".[83] In regard to identity politics, while the \"left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride\", he considers them \"equally dangerous\" and that what should be emphasized instead are individualism and individual responsibility.[97] He has also been prominent in the debate about cultural appropriation, stating the concept promotes self-censorship in society and journalism.[98] On September 27, 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled \"Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law\".[29][14] In the video, he stated he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech, and announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, which proposed to add \"gender identity or expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the hate speech laws in Canada.[14][99] He stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free-speech implications if the Criminal Code is amended, as he claimed he could then be prosecuted under provincial human-rights laws if he refuses to call a transgender student or faculty member by the individual's preferred pronoun.[15] Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed \"directly or indirectly\" as offensive, \"whether intentionally or unintentionally\".[16] Other academics and lawyers challenged Peterson's interpretation of C-16.[15] The series of videos drew criticism from transgender activists, faculty, and labour unions; critics accused Peterson of \"helping to foster a climate for hate to thrive\" and of \"fundamentally mischaracterising\" the law.[100][29] Protests erupted on campus, some including violence, and the controversy attracted international media attention.[101][102][103] When asked in September 2016 if he would comply with the request of a student to use a preferred pronoun, Peterson said \"it would depend on how they asked me\u00a0[...] If I could detect that there was a chip on their shoulder, or that they were [asking me] with political motives, then I would probably say no\u00a0[...] If I could have a conversation like the one we're having now, I could probably meet them on an equal level\".[103] Two months later, the National Post published an op-ed by Peterson in which he elaborated on his opposition to the bill and explained why he publicly made a stand against it: I will never use words I hate, like the trendy and artificially constructed words \"zhe\" and \"zher.\" These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century. I have been studying authoritarianism on the right and the left for 35 years. I wrote a book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, on the topic, which explores how ideologies hijack language and belief. As a result of my studies, I have come to believe that Marxism is a murderous ideology. I believe its practitioners in modern universities should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to promote such vicious, untenable and anti-human ideas, and for indoctrinating their students with these beliefs. I am therefore not going to mouth Marxist words. That would make me a puppet of the radical left, and that is not going to happen. Period.[104] In response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him that he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto.[105][29] In February 2017, Maxime Bernier, candidate for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, stated that he shifted his position on Bill C-16, from support to opposition, after meeting with Peterson and discussing it.[106] Peterson's analysis of the bill was also frequently cited by senators who were opposed to its passage.[107] In April 2017, Peterson was denied a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant for the first time in his career, which he interpreted as retaliation for his statements regarding Bill C-16.[36] A media-relations adviser for SSHRC said, \"Committees assess only the information contained in the application.\"[108] In response, The Rebel Media launched an Indiegogo campaign on Peterson's behalf.[109] The campaign raised C$195,000 by its end on May 6, equivalent to over two years of research funding.[110] In May 2017, Peterson spoke against Bill C-16 at a Canadian Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing. He was one of 24 witnesses who were invited to speak about the bill.[107] In November 2017, Lindsay Shepherd, the teaching assistant in a Wilfrid Laurier University first-year communications course, was censured by her professors for showing a segment of The Agenda, which featured Peterson debating Bill C-16 with another professor, during a classroom discussion about pronouns.[111][112][113] The reasons given for the censure included the clip creating a \"toxic climate\", being compared to a \"speech by Hitler\",[30] and being itself in violation of Bill C-16.[114] The censure was later withdrawn and both the professors and the university formally apologized.[115][116][117] The events were criticized by Peterson, as well as several newspaper editorial boards[118][119][120] and national newspaper columnists[121][122][123][124] as an example of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. In June 2018, Peterson filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier University, arguing that three staff members of the university had maliciously defamed him by making negative comments about him behind closed doors.[125] As of September\u00a02018,[update] Wilfrid Laurier had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that it was ironic for a purported advocate of free speech to attempt to curtail free speech.[126] Peterson has argued that there is an ongoing \"crisis of masculinity\" and \"backlash against masculinity\" in which the \"masculine spirit is under assault\".[24][127][128][129] He has argued that feminism and policies such as no-fault divorce have had adverse effects on gender relations and have destabilized society.[127] He has argued that the left characterises the existing societal hierarchy as an \"oppressive patriarchy\" but \"don\u2019t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.\"[24] Peterson has said that men without partners are likely to become violent, and has noted that male violence is reduced in societies wherein monogamy is a social norm.[24][127] He has attributed the rise of Donald Trump and far-right European politicians to what he says is a negative reaction to a push to \"feminize\" men, saying \"If men are pushed too hard to feminize they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.\"[130] He attracted considerable attention over a 2018 Channel 4 interview where he clashed with interviewer Cathy Newman on the topic of the gender pay gap.[131][132] Peterson disputed the contention that the disparity was solely due to sexual discrimination.[132][133][134] Peterson doubts the scientific consensus on climate change,[135][136] saying he is \"very skeptical of the models that are used to predict climate change,\"[137] and that \"[y]ou can't trust the data because too much ideology is involved\".[136][138] Peterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989.[29] They have one daughter and one son.[25][29] In a 2017 interview, Peterson was asked if he was a Christian; he responded, \"I suppose the most straight-forward answer to that is yes\".[139] When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: \"I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist\".[10] Writing for The Spectator, Tim Lott said Peterson draws inspiration from Jung's philosophy of religion and holds views similar to the Christian existentialism of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Lott also said that Peterson has respect for Taoism, as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos and posits that life would be meaningless without this duality.[32] Starting around 2000, Peterson began collecting Soviet-era paintings.[30] The paintings are displayed in his house as a reminder of the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror.[4][38] In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a Kwakwaka'wakw artist, and was given the name Alestalagie ('Great Seeker').[30][140] In late 2016, Peterson went on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables to control severe depression and an autoimmune disorder, including psoriasis and uveitis.[26][141] In mid 2018 he stopped eating vegetables, and continued eating only beef (see carnivore diet).[142] In 2019, Peterson entered a rehabilitation facility after experiencing symptoms of physical withdrawal when he stopped taking clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug. He had begun taking the drug upon his doctor's recommendation following his wife's cancer diagnosis.[143][144][145]",

His main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology,[1] with a particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief[2] and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.[3]\nPeterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from McGill University. He was a post-doctoral fellow at McGill from 1991 to 1993 before moving to Harvard University, where he was an assistant professor in the psychology department.[4][5] In 1998, he returned to Canada to become a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, where he eventually became a full professor.[6]\nPeterson's first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide.[7][8][9] His second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, was published in January 2018.[4][10][11]\nIn 2016, Peterson released a series[12] of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian government's Bill C-16, \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The act added \"gender identity and expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination,[a][13] which Peterson characterised as an introduction of compelled speech into law,[14][15][16] although legal experts have disagreed.[17] He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.[4][10][11] Several writers have associated Peterson with an \"Intellectual Dark Web\".[18][19][20][21][22]\nPeterson was born on June 12, 1962.[23] He grew up in Fairview, Alberta, a small town northwest of his birthplace (Edmonton).[24] He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher.[25][26] His middle name is Bernt (/\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r\u0259nt/ BAIR-\u0259nt),[27] after his Norwegian great-grandfather.[28]\nWhen Peterson was 13, he was introduced to the writings of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ayn Rand by his school librarian Sandy Notley (the mother of Rachel Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th Premier of Alberta).[29] He worked for the New Democratic Party (NDP) throughout his teenage years, but grew disenchanted with the party. He saw his experience of disillusionment resonating with Orwell's diagnosis, in The Road to Wigan Pier, of \"the intellectual, tweed-wearing middle-class socialist\" who \"didn't like the poor; they just hated the rich\".[25][30] He left the NDP at age 18.[31]\nAfter graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature.[2] He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982.[31] Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe. There he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War, 20th-century European totalitarianism,[2][32] and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,[25] and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[32] He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984.[33] In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.[2][34]\nFrom July 1993 to June 1998,[1] Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals.[31] Two former Ph.D. students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students.[4] In July 1998, he returned to Canada and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.[1][33]\nPeterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational,[1] religious, ideological,[2] political, and creativity psychology.[3] Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers[35] and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017.[36]\nFor most of his career, Peterson had an active clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He had been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16.[12][29][37] As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017[10] and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018.[26][38]\nIn June 2018, Peterson debated with Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver while moderated by Bret Weinstein, and again in July at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London while moderated by Douglas Murray, over the topic of religion and God.[39][40] In April 2019, Peterson debated professor Slavoj \u017di\u017eek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.[41][42]\nIn 1999 Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs and make narratives using ideas from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and psychology in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.[31][5][43]\nAccording to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in social conflict, explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification[31]) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Rwandan genocide.[31][5][43] He considers that an \"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality\".[43] Jungian archetypes play an important role in the book.[4]\nIn 2004, a 13-part TV series based on Peterson's book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief aired on TVOntario.[25][33][44]\nIn January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. The work contains abstract ethical principles about life, in a more accessible style than Maps of Meaning.[10][4][11]\nTo promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour.[45][46][47] As part of the tour, Peterson was interviewed in the UK by Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News which generated considerable attention, as well as popularity for the book.[48][49][50][51] The book topped bestselling lists in Canada, the US, and the United Kingdom.[52][53] As of January 2019, Peterson is working on a sequel to 12 Rules for Life.[54]\nIn 2013, Peterson began recording his lectures (\"Personality and Its Transformations\", \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\"[55]) and uploading them to YouTube. His YouTube channel has gathered more than 1.8 million subscribers and his videos have received more than 65 million views as of August 2018.[37][56] In January 2017, he hired a production team to film his psychology lectures at the University of Toronto. He used funds received on the crowdfunding website Patreon after he became embroiled in the Bill C-16 controversy in September 2016. His funding through Patreon has increased from $1,000 per month in August 2016 to $14,000 by January 2017, more than $50,000 by July 2017, and over $80,000 by May 2018.[29][37][57][58] In December 2018, Peterson decided to delete his Patreon account after Patreon's bans of political personalities who were violating Patreon's terms of service regarding hate speech.[59][60]\nPeterson has appeared on many podcasts, conversational series, as well other online shows.[56][61] In December 2016, Peterson started his own podcast, The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast, which has included academic guests such as Camille Paglia, Martin Daly, and James W. Pennebaker.[62] On his YouTube channel he has interviewed Stephen Hicks, Richard J. Haier, and Jonathan Haidt among others.[62] In March 2019, the podcast joined the Westwood One network with Peterson's daughter as a co-host on some episodes.[63] Peterson supported engineer James Damore in his action against Google.[11]\nIn May 2017, Peterson began The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,[64] a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in Book of Genesis as patterns of behavior ostensibly vital for personal, social and cultural stability.[11]\nIn March 2019, Peterson had his invitation of a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University rescinded. He had previously said that the fellowship would give him \"the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months\", and that the new lectures would have been on Book of Exodus.[65] A spokesperson for the University said that there was \"no place\" for anyone who could not uphold the \"inclusive environment\" of the university.[66] After a week, the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope explained that it was due to a photograph with a man wearing an Islamophobic shirt.[67] The Cambridge student union released a statement of relief, considering the invitation \"a political act to ... legitimise figures such as Peterson\" and that his work and views are not \"representative of the student body\".[68] Peterson called the decision a \"deeply unfortunate ... error of judgement\" and expressed regret that the Divinity Faculty had submitted to an \"ill-informed, ignorant and ideologically-addled mob\".[69][70]\nIn 2005, Peterson and his colleagues set up a for-profit company to provide and produce a writing therapy program with a series of online writing exercises.[71] Titled the Self Authoring Suite,[25] it includes the Past Authoring Program (a guided autobiography); two Present Authoring Programs which allow the participant to analyze their personality faults and virtues in terms of the Big Five personality model; and the Future Authoring Program which guides participants through the process of planning their desired futures. The latter program was used with McGill University undergraduates on academic probation to improve their grades, as well as since 2011 at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.[72][73] The programs were developed partially from research by James W. Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin and Gary Latham at the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto.[4] Peterson's co-authored 2015 study showed significant reduction in ethnic and gender-group differences in performance, especially among ethnic minority male students.[73][74] According to Peterson, more than 10,000 students have used the program as of January 2017, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and GPAs rising by 20%.[25]\nPeterson has characterized himself as a \"classic British liberal\",[32][75][76] and as a \"traditionalist\".[77] He has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right wing,[56] as, for example, The New York Times has described Peterson as \"conservative-leaning\",[78] and The Washington Post has described him as \"conservative\".[79] Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Yoram Hazony stated, \"The startling success of his elevated arguments for the importance of order has made him the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the English-speaking world in a generation.\"[80] Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs opines that Peterson has been seen \"as everything from a fascist apologist to an Enlightenment liberal, because his vacuous words are a kind of Rorschach test onto which countless interpretations can be projected.\"[81] Prominent libertarian socialist intellectual Noam Chomsky has agreed with Robinson's criticism, although he described Peterson as \"far on the right\".[82]\nPeterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as postmodernism, postmodern feminism, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism.[61][83]\nWriting in the National Post, Chris Selley said Peterson's opponents had \"underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions\",[84] while in The Spectator, Tim Lott stated Peterson became \"an outspoken critic of mainstream academia\".[32] Peterson's social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of The Globe and Mail noted: \"few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won\".[37]\nAccording to his study\u2014conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy\u2014of the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: \"PC-egalitarianism\" and \"PC-authoritarianism\", which is a manifestation of \"offense sensitivity\".[85] Jason McBride claims Peterson places classical liberals in the first type, and places so-called social justice warriors, who he says \"weaponize compassion\", in the second.[25][2] The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians.[85]\nPeterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe.[37] According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s.  In his view the humanities  have become corrupt and less reliant on science. Instead of \"intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological  conversation\". From his own experience as a  professor, he states that the students who are coming to his classes are uneducated about and unaware of the mass exterminations and other crimes against humanity perpetrated by Stalinism and Maoism, which were not given the same attention as fascism and Nazism. He also says that \"instead of being ennobled or inculcated into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from [the students] by post-modernism and neo-Marxism, which defines everything in terms of relativism and power\".[32][86][87]\n \u2014\u00a0Peterson, 2017[86]\nPeterson says that postmodern philosophers and sociologists since the 1960s[83] have built upon and extended certain core tenets of Marxism and communism while simultaneously appearing to disavow both ideologies. He says that it is difficult to understand contemporary Western society without considering the influence of a strain of postmodernist thought that migrated from France to the United States through the English department at Yale University. He states that certain academics in the humanities:[86]\n... started to play a sleight of hand, and instead of pitting the proletariat, the working class, against the bourgeois, they started to pit the oppressed against the oppressor. That opened up the avenue to identifying any number of groups as oppressed and oppressor and to continue the same narrative under a different name.... The people who hold this doctrine\u2013this radical, postmodern, communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity or some kind of group identity paramount\u2013they've got control over most low-to-mid level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well.\nPeterson's perspective on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments has been compared to Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories.[50][88][89][90]\nPeterson says that \"disciplines like women's studies should be defunded\" and advises freshman students to avoid subjects like sociology, anthropology, English literature, ethnic studies, and racial studies, as well as other fields of study he believes are corrupted by the neo-Marxist ideology.[91][92][93] He says that these fields, under the pretense of academic inquiry, propagate unscientific methods, fraudulent peer-review processes for academic journals, publications that garner zero citations,[94] cult-like behaviour,[92] safe-spaces,[91] and radical left-wing political activism for students.[83] Peterson has proposed launching a website which uses artificial intelligence to identify and showcase the amount of ideologization in specific courses. He announced in November 2017 that he had temporarily postponed the project as \"it might add excessively to current polarization\".[95][96]\nPeterson has criticized the use of the term \"white privilege\", stating that \"being called out on their white privilege, identified with a particular racial group and then made to suffer the consequences of the existence of that racial group and its hypothetical crimes, and that sort of thing has to come to a stop.\u00a0... [It's] racist in its extreme\".[83] In regard to identity politics, while the \"left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride\", he considers them \"equally dangerous\" and that what should be emphasized instead are individualism and individual responsibility.[97] He has also been prominent in the debate about cultural appropriation, stating the concept promotes self-censorship in society and journalism.[98]\nOn September 27, 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled \"Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law\".[29][14] In the video, he stated he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech, and announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, which proposed to add \"gender identity or expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the hate speech laws in Canada.[14][99]\nHe stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free-speech implications if the Criminal Code is amended, as he claimed he could then be prosecuted under provincial human-rights laws if he refuses to call a transgender student or faculty member by the individual's preferred pronoun.[15] Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed \"directly or indirectly\" as offensive, \"whether intentionally or unintentionally\".[16] Other academics and lawyers challenged Peterson's interpretation of C-16.[15]\nThe series of videos drew criticism from transgender activists, faculty, and labour unions; critics accused Peterson of \"helping to foster a climate for hate to thrive\" and of \"fundamentally mischaracterising\" the law.[100][29] Protests erupted on campus, some including violence, and the controversy attracted international media attention.[101][102][103] When asked in September 2016 if he would comply with the request of a student to use a preferred pronoun, Peterson said \"it would depend on how they asked me\u00a0[...] If I could detect that there was a chip on their shoulder, or that they were [asking me] with political motives, then I would probably say no\u00a0[...] If I could have a conversation like the one we're having now, I could probably meet them on an equal level\".[103] Two months later, the National Post published an op-ed by Peterson in which he elaborated on his opposition to the bill and explained why he publicly made a stand against it:\nI will never use words I hate, like the trendy and artificially constructed words \"zhe\" and \"zher.\" These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century.\nI have been studying authoritarianism on the right and the left for 35 years. I wrote a book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, on the topic, which explores how ideologies hijack language and belief. As a result of my studies, I have come to believe that Marxism is a murderous ideology. I believe its practitioners in modern universities should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to promote such vicious, untenable and anti-human ideas, and for indoctrinating their students with these beliefs. I am therefore not going to mouth Marxist words. That would make me a puppet of the radical left, and that is not going to happen. Period.[104]\nIn response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him that he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto.[105][29]\nIn February 2017, Maxime Bernier, candidate for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, stated that he shifted his position on Bill C-16, from support to opposition, after meeting with Peterson and discussing it.[106] Peterson's analysis of the bill was also frequently cited by senators who were opposed to its passage.[107] In April 2017, Peterson was denied a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant for the first time in his career, which he interpreted as retaliation for his statements regarding Bill C-16.[36] A media-relations adviser for SSHRC said, \"Committees assess only the information contained in the application.\"[108] In response, The Rebel Media launched an Indiegogo campaign on Peterson's behalf.[109] The campaign raised C$195,000 by its end on May 6, equivalent to over two years of research funding.[110] In May 2017, Peterson spoke against Bill C-16 at a Canadian Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing. He was one of 24 witnesses who were invited to speak about the bill.[107]\nIn November 2017, Lindsay Shepherd, the teaching assistant in a Wilfrid Laurier University first-year communications course, was censured by her professors for showing a segment of The Agenda, which featured Peterson debating Bill C-16 with another professor, during a classroom discussion about pronouns.[111][112][113] The reasons given for the censure included the clip creating a \"toxic climate\", being compared to a \"speech by Hitler\",[30] and being itself in violation of Bill C-16.[114] The censure was later withdrawn and both the professors and the university formally apologized.[115][116][117] The events were criticized by Peterson, as well as several newspaper editorial boards[118][119][120] and national newspaper columnists[121][122][123][124] as an example of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. In June 2018, Peterson filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier University, arguing that three staff members of the university had maliciously defamed him by making negative comments about him behind closed doors.[125] As of September\u00a02018,[update] Wilfrid Laurier had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that it was ironic for a purported advocate of free speech to attempt to curtail free speech.[126]\nPeterson has argued that there is an ongoing \"crisis of masculinity\" and \"backlash against masculinity\" in which the \"masculine spirit is under assault\".[24][127][128][129] He has argued that feminism and policies such as no-fault divorce have had adverse effects on gender relations and have destabilized society.[127] He has argued that the left characterises the existing societal hierarchy as an \"oppressive patriarchy\" but \"don\u2019t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.\"[24] Peterson has said that men without partners are likely to become violent, and has noted that male violence is reduced in societies wherein monogamy is a social norm.[24][127] He has attributed the rise of Donald Trump and far-right European politicians to what he says is a negative reaction to a push to \"feminize\" men, saying \"If men are pushed too hard to feminize they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.\"[130] He attracted considerable attention over a 2018 Channel 4 interview where he clashed with interviewer Cathy Newman on the topic of the gender pay gap.[131][132] Peterson disputed the contention that the disparity was solely due to sexual discrimination.[132][133][134]\nPeterson doubts the scientific consensus on climate change,[135][136] saying he is \"very skeptical of the models that are used to predict climate change,\"[137] and that \"[y]ou can't trust the data because too much ideology is involved\".[136][138]\nPeterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989.[29] They have one daughter and one son.[25][29]\nIn a 2017 interview, Peterson was asked if he was a Christian; he responded, \"I suppose the most straight-forward answer to that is yes\".[139] When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: \"I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist\".[10] Writing for The Spectator, Tim Lott said Peterson draws inspiration from Jung's philosophy of religion and holds views similar to the Christian existentialism of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Lott also said that Peterson has respect for Taoism, as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos and posits that life would be meaningless without this duality.[32]\nStarting around 2000, Peterson began collecting Soviet-era paintings.[30] The paintings are displayed in his house as a reminder of the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror.[4][38] In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a Kwakwaka'wakw artist, and was given the name Alestalagie ('Great Seeker').[30][140]\nIn late 2016, Peterson went on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables to control severe depression and an autoimmune disorder, including psoriasis and uveitis.[26][141] In mid 2018 he stopped eating vegetables, and continued eating only beef (see carnivore diet).[142] In 2019, Peterson entered a rehabilitation facility after experiencing symptoms of physical withdrawal when he stopped taking clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug. He had begun taking the drug upon his doctor's recommendation following his wife's cancer diagnosis.[143][144][145]\n</body></html>"

                "text": "no title\n\nDonald John Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977) is an American businessman and former reality television personality. He is the eldest child of US president Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana. A fourth-generation businessman (following his great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father), Trump Jr. currently serves as a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his younger brother Eric.[2] During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so.[3] He also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice. Trump Jr. has also been active politically, serving in his father's presidential campaign. He had a meeting with a Russian lawyer, who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[4][5][6] He is notorious for promoting conspiracy theories and false information.[7][8][9] As of May 2019, Trump Jr. is under investigation by the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, with Ivanka and Eric Trump, for their role in their father's inauguration.[10] He is also under investigation, along with Allen Weisselberg, for a possible role in concealing hush money payments and signed checks reimbursing per Michael Cohen regarding his father and the Trump Organization, by the Southern District of New York.[10] Trump Jr. was born on December 31, 1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump.[11] He has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through his father, Trump Jr. is a grandson of Fred Trump and great-grandson of Elizabeth Trump, who founded what became the Trump Organization. As a boy, Trump Jr. found a role model in his maternal grandfather, Milo\u0161 Zeln\u00ed\u010dek, who had a home near Prague, where he spent summers camping, fishing, hunting and learning the Czech language.[12] Trump's parents divorced when he was 13 years old. His mother told him his father was having an extramarital affair. Trump was estranged from his father for one year after the divorce, furious at his actions which broke up the family.[13] Trump Jr. was educated at Buckley School[14][15] and the Hill School, a college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, followed by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, where he graduated in 2000 with a B.S. in Economics.[16] After graduating from Penn in 2000, Trump moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, skied, lived in a truck, and worked as a bartender for a year, before returning to join the Trump Organization in New York. Trump has supervised building projects, which included 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Park Avenue,[17] In 2006 he helped launch Trump Mortgage, which collapsed less than a year later.[11] In 2010 he became a spokesperson for Cambridge Who's Who, a public relations firm that had received hundreds of complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau.[11] He appeared as a guest adviser and judge on many episodes of his father's reality television show The Apprentice, from season 5 in 2006 to his father's last season in 2015.[18] On January 11, 2017, Trump's father announced that he and his brother Eric would oversee a trust that included the Trump Organization's assets while his father was president, in order to avert a conflict of interest.[19] Amid the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal \u2013 where Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u00a0\u2013 Trump Jr. strongly criticized Hunter Biden, accusing him of nepotism and leveraging his father as a means to get financial benefits. Trump Jr. said, \"When you're the father and your son's entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\" Trump Jr. was widely ridiculed for these remarks by Trevor Noah and others. Trump Jr. is a top executive in his father's business and has continued to operate and promote the family's businesses across the world during Trump's presidency.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The Associated Press wrote of Trump Jr.'s, remarks that he was \"showing no self-awareness that he, too, has at least in part been successful because of a famous father\".[26] According to the Washington Post fact-checker, Trump Jr.'s assertion that he and his family members had gotten out of foreign business deals after Trump became president is false.[3] The Washington Post noted that after Trump became president, \"Trump's sons have been busy selling assets to foreign individuals, expanding or adding onto their existing deals and investments in foreign countries, and collecting payments in U.S. properties from foreign governments.\"[3] In February 2018, advertisements in Indian newspapers promoted a deal whereby anyone who purchased Trump Organization apartments in Gurgaon before February 20 would be invited to have a \"conversation and dinner\" with Trump Jr. The ads were criticized by corruption watchdogs as unethical.[27][28] Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump Jr. was a key member of his father's campaign,[29] characterized by The New York Times as a \"close political adviser\".[30] He spoke at the Republican National Convention, along with his siblings Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany.[30] Trump Jr. influenced his father's choice of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke during the presidential transition.[31][32] Since his father's victory in the 2016 election, Trump Jr. has developed what The Washington Post calls a \"public persona as a right-wing provocateur and ardent defender of Trumpism\".[33] On June 9, 2016, Trump Jr. attended a meeting arranged by publicist Rob Goldstone on behalf of Azerbaijani-Russian businessman Emin Agalarov.[34] The meeting was held in Trump Tower in Manhattan, among three members of the presidential campaign: Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort\u00a0\u2013 and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, her translator Anatoli Samochornov, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and Ike Kaveladze, a Georgian-American, U.S.-based senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development company run by Aras Agalarov.[34] Approximately a year later, Trump Jr. initially told the media that adoption of Russian children was the main subject of the meeting.[35] On July 8, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted his email exchange with Goldstone. It revealed that Trump Jr. had agreed to attend the meeting with the understanding he would receive information damaging to Hillary Clinton, which he considered opposition research.[36][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Goldstone also wrote in one of Trump Jr.'s publicly disclosed emails that the Russian government was involved.[36] Robert Mueller, the special counsel of the Department of Justice in charge of Russia-related investigations, investigated the emails and the meeting.[37] Although the White House lauded Trump Jr. for his transparency, he released the e-mails only after The New York Times had informed him that they had them and were going to publish a story about them.[38] Trump Jr. had a meeting in August 2016 with emissary for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[39] The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation; George Nader, an envoy representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia; and American businessman Erik Prince.[40][39] In November 2017, news broke that Julian Assange had used the WikiLeaks Twitter account to corresponded with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. Trump Jr. had already provided this correspondence to congressional investigators who were looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[41][42][43] The correspondence showed that WikiLeaks actively solicited the cooperation of Trump Jr., who was a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it appeared the Trump campaign would lose. WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share an unsubstantiated[44] claim that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack Assange with drones. WikiLeaks also shared a link to a website that would help people search through Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's hacked e-mails, which Wikileaks had recently made public. Trump Jr. shared both.[41][42] During the 2018 midterms election cycle, Trump actively campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates, including for Matt Rosendale, Patrick Morrisey, Mike Braun, Ron DeSantis, Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz.[45] He raised millions of dollars for Republican candidates, was second only to his father in his ability to draw crows to draw campaign events, and is credited with helping Republican candidates win.[46] In 2011, Trump Jr. responded to criticism of the Tea Party movement by Florida Representative Frederica Wilson by confusing Wilson with California Representative Maxine Waters and saying her colorful hats made her look like a stripper.[47] In April 2017, he campaigned for Montana congressional candidate Greg Gianforte,[48] and in May met with Republican National Committee officials to discuss the party's strategy and resources.[49] In September 2017, Trump Jr. asked to have his Secret Service detail removed, telling friends he wanted more privacy. The request was criticized by former Secret Service agents.[50] Trump Jr.'s protection was restored later that month.[51] During his father's presidential campaign, Trump Jr. caused controversy in 2016 when he posted an image that compared refugees to Skittles, saying \"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\"[30][52][53] The makers of Skittles condemned the tweet, saying \"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\"[53][30] The Cato Institute reported that year that the chances \"an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was one in 3.64 billion\" per year.[54] On March 1, 2016, an interview with white supremacist James Edwards and Trump Jr. was aired. The campaign initially denied the interview had taken place; later Trump Jr. claimed it was unintentional.[55] As a consequence of the interview, mainstream media outlets have accused Trump Jr. of being either a believer in the white genocide conspiracy theory,[56] or pretending to be an advocate for political gain.[57] In September 2016, Trump Jr. cited Holocaust imagery to criticize what he perceived as the mainstream media's seemingly uncritical coverage of Hillary Clinton during her campaign, by \"letting her slide on every discrepancy\", while also accusing Democrats involved in the 2016 campaign of lying. Trump Jr. said if the Republicans were committing the same offences mainstream outlets would be \"...\u00a0warming up the gas chamber right now.\"[58][59] Also that month, Trump Jr. shared an image on Instagram depicting a cross between his father and Pepe the Frog. When asked on Good Morning America about Pepe the Frog and its associations with white supremacy, Trump Jr. said he had never heard of Pepe the Frog and thought it was just a \"frog with a wig\".[60] In April 2017, Trump Jr. lauded Mike Cernovich, who promotes the white genocide and debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theories,[61] saying, \"In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he'd win the Pulitzer\".[62][63] Trump Jr. retweeted conspiratorial remarks by white supremacist Kevin B. MacDonald about alleged favors exchanged by Hillary Clinton and Switzerland's largest bank.[30] On the campaign trail, Trump Jr. promoted Alex Jones' conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton wore an earpiece to a presidential forum[64][65][66] and that official unemployment rates were manipulated for political purposes.[67] In March 2017, Trump Jr. criticized the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, after the 2017 Westminster attack, which in turn led British lawmakers to criticize Trump Jr.[68][69][70] British journalists said Trump Jr. had quoted Khan out of context when he criticized him.[69][70] Khan did not respond to the criticism, saying he had \"far more important things\" to do.[68] In May 2017, Trump Jr. promoted what CNN called the \"long-debunked, far-right conspiracy theory\" that Bill Clinton was linked to Vince Foster's death.[71] In November, Trump Jr. again promoted the conspiracy theory that the Clintons murdered people.[72] In February 2018, Trump Jr. liked two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory that survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting were coached into propagating anti-Trump rhetoric.[73][74] In May 2018, Trump Jr. retweeted a false and antisemitic conspiracy theory that George Soros, the Jewish Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist, was a \"nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth\".[75][11][76] The tweets originated from Roseanne Barr, whose TV show was cancelled the same day for posting a series of racist and antisemitic tweets.[75] George Soros's spokesperson responded to the tweets, \"George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13-year-old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive the Holocaust.\"[76] In June 2018, Trump Jr. liked a tweet suggesting that the migrant children separated from their parents due to the Trump administration family separation policy were actually actors.[77] In August 2018, Trump Jr. shared on Instagram of a doctored image which had been crudely edited to falsely state that CNN had reported President Trump's approval rating as 50%. The actual CNN report had Trump at 40%, below Obama's 45% at the same point of his presidency. Trump Jr. deleted the image two days later.[78][79] In September 2018, when Hurricane Florence was affecting the United States, Trump Jr. tweeted a picture of CNN journalist Anderson Cooper waist-deep in floodwaters when another man in the same picture was standing knee-deep a distance away. Trump Jr. then proposed a conspiracy theory that CNN was \"lying to try to make [his father, President Trump] look bad\". In actuality, the picture of Cooper was around ten years old, taken during 2008's Hurricane Ike before Trump became president, and Cooper was videoed talking about how the floodwaters were receding.[80] On October 31, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted that he would take away half his three-year-old daughter's Halloween candy because, he wrote, \"it's never too early to teach her about socialism.\"[81] On November 7, 2017, he posted tweets urging voters in Virginia's gubernatorial election to vote \"tomorrow\", the day after the election.[82] In November 2019, Trump Jr. tweeted the name of the alleged whistleblower who brought to light the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Whistleblower conventions are intended to protect the identity of individuals who expose wrongdoing in government. Agence France-Presse attempted to independently verify the identity that Trump Jr. tweeted, but was unable to do so.[83] In 2019, Trump Jr. released the book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. The book is critical of political correctness, and argues that the American left has a victimhood complex.[84] The Washington Post noted, \"yet, in his telling, the real victim is often him, his father or another Trump family member.\"[84] In the book, Trump Jr. pushes conspiracy theories about how the intelligence community has attempted to harm President Trump, comparing President Trump's experiences with the FBI harassment campaign against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.[85] Trump Jr. also writes about a visit to Arlington National Cemetery (a military cemetery), saying he got emotional looking at the graves and that it reminded him of \"all the sacrifices\" the Trump family had made, including \"voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were 'profiting off of the office'\".[84][85] Fact-checkers have noted that Trump still owns the family business, and that the Trump family have continued to engage in international business deals since Trump became president.[84] In a review for The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada said, \"fails as memoir and as polemic: Its analysis is facile, its hypocrisy relentless, its self-awareness marginal. (The writing is wretched, even by the standards of political vanity projects.)\"[86] The book was a New York Times best-seller. The book was purchased in bulk by at least nine Republican organizations, candidates or advocacy groups, including N.R.C.C. and the R.N.C. which bought $75,000 and $100,000 worth of the books, respectively. Turning Point USA and the National Republican Senatorial Committee purchased approximately 2,000 and 2,500 books, respectively.[87] In 2003, Trump Jr. began dating model Vanessa Kay Haydon at his father's suggestion.[11] The couple married on November 12, 2005, at his father's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; the service was officiated by Trump Jr.'s aunt, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry.[88] Haydon's grandfather was Danish jazz musician Kai Ewans.[89][90][91][92] They have five children.[93][94] On March 15, 2018, it was announced that the couple had separated and she had filed for uncontested divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court.[95][96][97] However, later it was revealed that the divorce is contested.[98] The complaint is secret except for the title of the case.[99] On February 22, 2019, they announced that they settled their divorce at the end of 2018.[100] Since 2018, Trump has been dating Kimberly Guilfoyle.[46][101] Guilfoyle had been friends with the Trump family for years.[102] Trump Jr. is an enthusiastic hunter. Controversy erupted in 2012 when the pictures he had taken of his hunting trophies in 2010 were published. In one photo, Trump Jr. has his arms around a dead leopard; in another, he is holding a knife in one hand and a bloody elephant tail in the other. Although the hunt was legal, anti-hunting activists criticized him. At least one sponsor dropped his father's TV show The Celebrity Apprentice.[103] On Earth Day in 2017, Trump Jr. legally hunted prairie dogs in Montana with GOP Congressional candidate Greg Gianforte.[104] President Trump reversed the decision to allow elephant trophies imported from Zambia and Zimbabwe, pending further review.[105] ProPublica revealed on December 11, 2019, that the government of Mongolia retroactively granted Donald Trump Jr. a hunting permit for the endangered Argali mountain sheep.[106]",

He is the eldest child of US president Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana.\nA fourth-generation businessman (following his great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father), Trump Jr. currently serves as a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his younger brother Eric.[2] During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so.[3] He also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice.\nTrump Jr. has also been active politically, serving in his father's presidential campaign. He had a meeting with a Russian lawyer, who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.[4][5][6] He is notorious for promoting conspiracy theories and false information.[7][8][9] As of May 2019, Trump Jr. is under investigation by the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, with Ivanka and Eric Trump, for their role in their father's inauguration.[10] He is also under investigation, along with Allen Weisselberg, for a possible role in concealing hush money payments and signed checks reimbursing per Michael Cohen regarding his father and the Trump Organization, by the Southern District of New York.[10]\nTrump Jr. was born on December 31, 1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump.[11] He has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through his father, Trump Jr. is a grandson of Fred Trump and great-grandson of Elizabeth Trump, who founded what became the Trump Organization. As a boy, Trump Jr. found a role model in his maternal grandfather, Milo\u0161 Zeln\u00ed\u010dek, who had a home near Prague, where he spent summers camping, fishing, hunting and learning the Czech language.[12]\nTrump's parents divorced when he was 13 years old. His mother told him his father was having an extramarital affair. Trump was estranged from his father for one year after the divorce, furious at his actions which broke up the family.[13]\nTrump Jr. was educated at Buckley School[14][15] and the Hill School, a college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, followed by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, where he graduated in 2000 with a B.S. in Economics.[16]\nAfter graduating from Penn in 2000, Trump moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, skied, lived in a truck, and worked as a bartender for a year, before returning to join the Trump Organization in New York. Trump has supervised building projects, which included 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Park Avenue,[17] In 2006 he helped launch Trump Mortgage, which collapsed less than a year later.[11] In 2010 he became a spokesperson for Cambridge Who's Who, a public relations firm that had received hundreds of complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau.[11] He appeared as a guest adviser and judge on many episodes of his father's reality television show The Apprentice, from season 5 in 2006 to his father's last season in 2015.[18]\nOn January 11, 2017, Trump's father announced that he and his brother Eric would oversee a trust that included the Trump Organization's assets while his father was president, in order to avert a conflict of interest.[19]\nAmid the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal \u2013 where Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u00a0\u2013 Trump Jr. strongly criticized Hunter Biden, accusing him of nepotism and leveraging his father as a means to get financial benefits. Trump Jr. said, \"When you're the father and your son's entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\" Trump Jr. was widely ridiculed for these remarks by Trevor Noah and others. Trump Jr. is a top executive in his father's business and has continued to operate and promote the family's businesses across the world during Trump's presidency.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The Associated Press wrote of Trump Jr.'s, remarks that he was \"showing no self-awareness that he, too, has at least in part been successful because of a famous father\".[26] According to the Washington Post fact-checker, Trump Jr.'s assertion that he and his family members had gotten out of foreign business deals after Trump became president is false.[3] The Washington Post noted that after Trump became president, \"Trump's sons have been busy selling assets to foreign individuals, expanding or adding onto their existing deals and investments in foreign countries, and collecting payments in U.S. properties from foreign governments.\"[3]\nIn February 2018, advertisements in Indian newspapers promoted a deal whereby anyone who purchased Trump Organization apartments in Gurgaon before February 20 would be invited to have a \"conversation and dinner\" with Trump Jr. The ads were criticized by corruption watchdogs as unethical.[27][28]\nAhead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump Jr. was a key member of his father's campaign,[29] characterized by The New York Times as a \"close political adviser\".[30] He spoke at the Republican National Convention, along with his siblings Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany.[30]\nTrump Jr. influenced his father's choice of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke during the presidential transition.[31][32] Since his father's victory in the 2016 election, Trump Jr. has developed what The Washington Post calls a \"public persona as a right-wing provocateur and ardent defender of Trumpism\".[33]\nOn June 9, 2016, Trump Jr. attended a meeting arranged by publicist Rob Goldstone on behalf of Azerbaijani-Russian businessman Emin Agalarov.[34] The meeting was held in Trump Tower in Manhattan, among three members of the presidential campaign: Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort\u00a0\u2013 and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, her translator Anatoli Samochornov, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and Ike Kaveladze, a Georgian-American, U.S.-based senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development company run by Aras Agalarov.[34]\nApproximately a year later, Trump Jr. initially told the media that adoption of Russian children was the main subject of the meeting.[35] On July 8, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted his email exchange with Goldstone. It revealed that Trump Jr. had agreed to attend the meeting with the understanding he would receive information damaging to Hillary Clinton, which he considered opposition research.[36][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Goldstone also wrote in one of Trump Jr.'s publicly disclosed emails that the Russian government was involved.[36] Robert Mueller, the special counsel of the Department of Justice in charge of Russia-related investigations, investigated the emails and the meeting.[37] Although the White House lauded Trump Jr. for his transparency, he released the e-mails only after The New York Times had informed him that they had them and were going to publish a story about them.[38]\nTrump Jr. had a meeting in August 2016 with emissary for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[39] The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation; George Nader, an envoy representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia; and American businessman Erik Prince.[40][39]\nIn November 2017, news broke that Julian Assange had used the WikiLeaks Twitter account to corresponded with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. Trump Jr. had already provided this correspondence to congressional investigators who were looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[41][42][43]\nThe correspondence showed that WikiLeaks actively solicited the cooperation of Trump Jr., who was a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it appeared the Trump campaign would lose. WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share an unsubstantiated[44] claim that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack Assange with drones. WikiLeaks also shared a link to a website that would help people search through Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's hacked e-mails, which Wikileaks had recently made public. Trump Jr. shared both.[41][42]\nDuring the 2018 midterms election cycle, Trump actively campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates, including for Matt Rosendale, Patrick Morrisey, Mike Braun, Ron DeSantis, Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz.[45] He raised millions of dollars for Republican candidates, was second only to his father in his ability to draw crows to draw campaign events, and is credited with helping Republican candidates win.[46]\nIn 2011, Trump Jr. responded to criticism of the Tea Party movement by Florida Representative Frederica Wilson by confusing Wilson with California Representative Maxine Waters and saying her colorful hats made her look like a stripper.[47]\nIn April 2017, he campaigned for Montana congressional candidate Greg Gianforte,[48] and in May met with Republican National Committee officials to discuss the party's strategy and resources.[49]\nIn September 2017, Trump Jr. asked to have his Secret Service detail removed, telling friends he wanted more privacy. The request was criticized by former Secret Service agents.[50] Trump Jr.'s protection was restored later that month.[51]\nDuring his father's presidential campaign, Trump Jr. caused controversy in 2016 when he posted an image that compared refugees to Skittles, saying \"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\"[30][52][53] The makers of Skittles condemned the tweet, saying \"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\"[53][30] The Cato Institute reported that year that the chances \"an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was one in 3.64 billion\" per year.[54]\nOn March 1, 2016, an interview with white supremacist James Edwards and Trump Jr. was aired. The campaign initially denied the interview had taken place; later Trump Jr. claimed it was unintentional.[55] As a consequence of the interview, mainstream media outlets have accused Trump Jr. of being either a believer in the white genocide conspiracy theory,[56] or pretending to be an advocate for political gain.[57]\nIn September 2016, Trump Jr. cited Holocaust imagery to criticize what he perceived as the mainstream media's seemingly uncritical coverage of Hillary Clinton during her campaign, by \"letting her slide on every discrepancy\", while also accusing Democrats involved in the 2016 campaign of lying. Trump Jr. said if the Republicans were committing the same offences mainstream outlets would be \"...\u00a0warming up the gas chamber right now.\"[58][59] Also that month, Trump Jr. shared an image on Instagram depicting a cross between his father and Pepe the Frog. When asked on Good Morning America about Pepe the Frog and its associations with white supremacy, Trump Jr. said he had never heard of Pepe the Frog and thought it was just a \"frog with a wig\".[60]\nIn April 2017, Trump Jr. lauded Mike Cernovich, who promotes the white genocide and debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theories,[61] saying, \"In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he'd win the Pulitzer\".[62][63]\nTrump Jr. retweeted conspiratorial remarks by white supremacist Kevin B. MacDonald about alleged favors exchanged by Hillary Clinton and Switzerland's largest bank.[30] On the campaign trail, Trump Jr. promoted Alex Jones' conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton wore an earpiece to a presidential forum[64][65][66] and that official unemployment rates were manipulated for political purposes.[67]\nIn March 2017, Trump Jr. criticized the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, after the 2017 Westminster attack, which in turn led British lawmakers to criticize Trump Jr.[68][69][70] British journalists said Trump Jr. had quoted Khan out of context when he criticized him.[69][70] Khan did not respond to the criticism, saying he had \"far more important things\" to do.[68]\nIn May 2017, Trump Jr. promoted what CNN called the \"long-debunked, far-right conspiracy theory\" that Bill Clinton was linked to Vince Foster's death.[71] In November, Trump Jr. again promoted the conspiracy theory that the Clintons murdered people.[72]\nIn February 2018, Trump Jr. liked two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory that survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting were coached into propagating anti-Trump rhetoric.[73][74]\nIn May 2018, Trump Jr. retweeted a false and antisemitic conspiracy theory that George Soros, the Jewish Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist, was a \"nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps &amp; stole their wealth\".[75][11][76] The tweets originated from Roseanne Barr, whose TV show was cancelled the same day for posting a series of racist and antisemitic tweets.[75] George Soros's spokesperson responded to the tweets, \"George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13-year-old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive the Holocaust.\"[76]\nIn June 2018, Trump Jr. liked a tweet suggesting that the migrant children separated from their parents due to the Trump administration family separation policy were actually actors.[77]\nIn August 2018, Trump Jr. shared on Instagram of a doctored image which had been crudely edited to falsely state that CNN had reported President Trump's approval rating as 50%. The actual CNN report had Trump at 40%, below Obama's 45% at the same point of his presidency. Trump Jr. deleted the image two days later.[78][79]\nIn September 2018, when Hurricane Florence was affecting the United States, Trump Jr. tweeted a picture of CNN journalist Anderson Cooper waist-deep in floodwaters when another man in the same picture was standing knee-deep a distance away. Trump Jr. then proposed a conspiracy theory that CNN was \"lying to try to make [his father, President Trump] look bad\". In actuality, the picture of Cooper was around ten years old, taken during 2008's Hurricane Ike before Trump became president, and Cooper was videoed talking about how the floodwaters were receding.[80]\nOn October 31, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted that he would take away half his three-year-old daughter's Halloween candy because, he wrote, \"it's never too early to teach her about socialism.\"[81]\nOn November 7, 2017, he posted tweets urging voters in Virginia's gubernatorial election to vote \"tomorrow\", the day after the election.[82]\nIn November 2019, Trump Jr. tweeted the name of the alleged whistleblower who brought to light the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Whistleblower conventions are intended to protect the identity of individuals who expose wrongdoing in government. Agence France-Presse attempted to independently verify the identity that Trump Jr. tweeted, but was unable to do so.[83]\nIn 2019, Trump Jr. released the book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. The book is critical of political correctness, and argues that the American left has a victimhood complex.[84] The Washington Post noted, \"yet, in his telling, the real victim is often him, his father or another Trump family member.\"[84] In the book, Trump Jr. pushes conspiracy theories about how the intelligence community has attempted to harm President Trump, comparing President Trump's experiences with the FBI harassment campaign against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.[85] Trump Jr. also writes about a visit to Arlington National Cemetery (a military cemetery), saying he got emotional looking at the graves and that it reminded him of \"all the sacrifices\" the Trump family had made, including \"voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were 'profiting off of the office'\".[84][85] Fact-checkers have noted that Trump still owns the family business, and that the Trump family have continued to engage in international business deals since Trump became president.[84] In a review for The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada said, \"fails as memoir and as polemic: Its analysis is facile, its hypocrisy relentless, its self-awareness marginal. (The writing is wretched, even by the standards of political vanity projects.)\"[86]\nThe book was a New York Times best-seller. The book was purchased in bulk by at least nine Republican organizations, candidates or advocacy groups, including N.R.C.C. and the R.N.C. which bought $75,000 and $100,000 worth of the books, respectively. Turning Point USA and the National Republican Senatorial Committee purchased approximately 2,000 and 2,500 books, respectively.[87]\nIn 2003, Trump Jr. began dating model Vanessa Kay Haydon at his father's suggestion.[11] The couple married on November 12, 2005, at his father's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; the service was officiated by Trump Jr.'s aunt, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry.[88] Haydon's grandfather was Danish jazz musician Kai Ewans.[89][90][91][92] They have five children.[93][94]\nOn March 15, 2018, it was announced that the couple had separated and she had filed for uncontested divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court.[95][96][97] However, later it was revealed that the divorce is contested.[98] The complaint is secret except for the title of the case.[99] On February 22, 2019, they announced that they settled their divorce at the end of 2018.[100]\nSince 2018, Trump has been dating Kimberly Guilfoyle.[46][101] Guilfoyle had been friends with the Trump family for years.[102]\nTrump Jr. is an enthusiastic hunter. Controversy erupted in 2012 when the pictures he had taken of his hunting trophies in 2010 were published. In one photo, Trump Jr. has his arms around a dead leopard; in another, he is holding a knife in one hand and a bloody elephant tail in the other. Although the hunt was legal, anti-hunting activists criticized him. At least one sponsor dropped his father's TV show The Celebrity Apprentice.[103] On Earth Day in 2017, Trump Jr. legally hunted prairie dogs in Montana with GOP Congressional candidate Greg Gianforte.[104] President Trump reversed the decision to allow elephant trophies imported from Zambia and Zimbabwe, pending further review.[105]\nProPublica revealed on December 11, 2019, that the government of Mongolia retroactively granted Donald Trump Jr. a hunting permit for the endangered Argali mountain sheep.[106]\n</body></html>"

She is currently signed to WWE as a wrestler.[12] Her longstanding nickname, \"Rowdy\", was inherited from late professional wrestler Roddy Piper.[1] After becoming the first American woman to earn an Olympic medal in judo by winning bronze at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Rousey began pursuing a career in mixed martial arts (MMA). She won her MMA debut for King of the Cage before going to Strikeforce, where she became the last-ever Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Champion before the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bought Strikeforce in 2011.[13] She was their inaugural female champion when she was named UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion. Rousey took part in the first women's fight in UFC history when she successfully defended her title against Liz Carmouche at UFC 157. After setting the record for most UFC title defenses by a woman (6), Rousey had her first professional loss in MMA when she lost her title to Holly Holm.[14][15][16][17] In 2018, she became the first female fighter to be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame.[18] In 2018, Rousey began a career in professional wrestling, signing a contract with WWE.[19] She debuted at WrestleMania 34, and later won the Raw Women's Championship, her first WWE and professional wrestling title, at SummerSlam. She then headlined the inaugural WWE all-women's pay-per-view event when she successfully defended her title against Nikki Bella at WWE Evolution. Rousey had her first WWE loss when she lost her title in the first-ever women's WrestleMania main-event to Becky Lynch in a triple threat match at WrestleMania 35; this left her reign as Raw Women's Champion as the second-longest in the title's history at 231 days. Rousey has also enjoyed success as an actress and author, appearing in the films The Expendables 3 (2014),[20] Furious 7 (2015),[21] and Mile 22 (2018),[22] and releasing her autobiography My Fight / Your Fight in 2015.[23] Rousey is the only woman to win a championship in both the UFC and WWE, as well as the only woman to headline a pay-per-view event in both companies.[24] Rousey was voted the best female athlete of all-time in a 2015 ESPN fan poll, and Fox Sports described her as \"one of the defining athletes of the 21st century.\"[25][26][27][28] Ronda Jean Rousey was born in Riverside, California[29] on February 1, 1987, the youngest of three daughters of AnnMaria De Mars (n\u00e9e Waddell) and Ron Rousey,[30] after whom she was named.[31] Her mother, a decorated judoka, was the first American to win a World Judo Championship (in 1984). Rousey is of English, Polish, Trinidadian, and Venezuelan ancestry.[32] Her Venezuelan maternal grandfather was partly of Afro-Venezuelan descent and her Trinidadian maternal great-grandfather, Alfred E Waddell, was a doctor who emigrated to Canada and became one of the first black physicians in North America.[33][34][35] Her stepfather is an aerospace engineer.[36] Her biological father, after breaking his back sledding with his daughters and learning that he would be a paraplegic, committed suicide in 1995 when Rousey was eight.[31][37] AnnMaria pursued a Ph.D. in educational psychology at the University of California, Riverside as her daughters grew up.[31][38] For the first six years of her life, Rousey struggled with speech and could not form an intelligible sentence due to apraxia, a neurological childhood speech sound disorder.[39] This speech disorder was attributed to being born with her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck. When Rousey was three years old, her mother and father moved from Riverside, California, to Jamestown, North Dakota, to obtain intensive speech therapy with specialists at Minot State University.[40][41] Rousey dropped out of high school and later earned her GED.[42] She was raised between Jamestown and Southern California, retiring from her judo career at 21 and starting her MMA career at 22 when she realized that she did not want to spend her life in a conventional field of work.[43] Rousey began judo with her mother at the age of 11. Rousey trained with her mother until she was 13, when she accidentally broke her mother's wrist.[44] At 17, Rousey was the youngest judoka to qualify for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Rousey lost in her first match to silver medalist Claudia Heill in the 63\u00a0kg bracket. Also in 2004, Rousey won a gold medal at the World Junior Judo Championships in Budapest, Hungary. In April 2006, she became the first female U.S. judoka in nearly 10 years to win an A-Level tournament as she went 5-0 to claim gold at the Birmingham World Cup in Great Britain. Later that year, the 19-year-old won the bronze medal at the Junior World Championships, becoming the first U.S. athlete to win two Junior World medals.[45] In February 2007, Rousey moved up to 70\u00a0kg where she ranked as one of the top three women in the world. She won the silver medal at the 2007 World Judo Championships in the middleweight division and the gold medal at the 2007 Pan American Games.[46] In August 2008, Rousey competed at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. She lost her quarterfinal to the Dutch ex-world champion Edith Bosch but qualified for a bronze medal match through the repechage bracket. Rousey defeated Annett Boehm by Yuko to win a bronze medal (Judo offers two bronze medals per weight class.) With the victory, Rousey became the first American to win an Olympic medal in women's judo since its inception as an Olympic sport in 1992.[47][48] Rousey retired from judo at 21 after the Olympics. After winning her Olympic medal, Rousey shared a studio apartment with a roommate in Venice Beach, California and worked three jobs as a bartender and cocktail waitress to support herself and her dog.[49] When Rousey started learning judo, her mother took her to judo clubs run by her old teammates. Rousey went to Hayastan MMA Academy, which was run by Gokor Chivichyan, where she trained with fellow future MMA fighters Manny Gamburyan and Karo Parisyan. According to Rousey, Hayastan practiced \"a more brawling style of judo versus the more technical Japanese style.\" Rousey trained mostly with males bigger than she was and often got frustrated and cried when she got thrown and could not throw somebody. \"Probably from 2002 to 2005 I cried every single night of training,\" Rousey remarked.[44] Rousey trained closely with Gamburyan. After injuring her knee when she was 16, Gamburyan volunteered to open the gym every afternoon and work with her personally. Back in 2004, her teammates thought Rousey \"would kill these girls\" in MMA, but also thought she was \"too pretty to get hit in the face\" and should keep doing judo. While Gamburyan and Parisyan went into MMA, Rousey stuck with judo but remained in touch with MMA through them. The first MMA fight she took an interest in watching was Manny Gamburyan versus Nate Diaz in The Ultimate Fighter finale. Rousey stated she never got as excited watching judo or any other sport. After the 2008 Olympics the following year, she decided to start MMA through Team Hayastan.[44] Rousey also trained at the Glendale Fighting Club, to which she was introduced by Gamburyan and other Hayastan teammates. She started training under her long-term MMA coach Edmond Tarverdyan at GFC.[50] She trained in Jiu Jitsu at Dynamix MMA with Henry Akins from 2011 to 2014[51] and went on to train with Ryron Graice and Rener Gracie of Gracie Academy,[52] as well as BJ Penn of Art of Jiu Jitsu.[53] Rousey made her mixed martial arts debut as an amateur on August 6, 2010. She defeated Hayden Munoz by submission due to an armbar in 23 seconds.[54] She entered the quarterfinals of the Tuff-N-Uff 145\u00a0lbs women's tournament on November 12, 2010, and submitted promotional veteran Autumn Richardson with an armbar in 57 seconds.[55] Rousey faced Taylor Stratford in the Tuff-N-Uff tournament semi-finals on January 7, 2011, and won by technical submission due to an armbar in 24 seconds. She then announced plans to turn pro and was replaced in the tournament.[56] Rousey has a 3-0 record in amateur MMA competition, and the combined duration of all her amateur fights is under 2 minutes.[43] Rousey made her professional mixed martial arts debut on March 27, 2011, at King of the Cage: Turning Point. She submitted Ediane Gomes with an armbar in 25 seconds.[54][57] Rousey faced kickboxing champion Charmaine Tweet in an MMA bout at Hard Knocks Fighting Championship: School of Hard Knocks 12 on June 17, 2011, in Calgary, Canada.[58] She submitted Tweet with an armbar in 49 seconds.[59][60] Rousey was scheduled to make her Strikeforce debut against Sarah D'Alelio on July 30, 2011, at Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Henderson in Hoffman Estates, Illinois.[61] The fight was postponed and eventually took place on the Strikeforce Challengers 18 main card on August 12, 2011, in Las Vegas, Nevada.[62] Rousey defeated D'Alelio by technical submission due to an armbar early in the first round. The victory was controversial. Rousey claimed that D'Alelio yelled \"tap\" more than once and that D'Alelio denied this and claimed to have yelled \"Aaaahhh\". According to the unified rules of mixed martial arts, either one of these utterances would still be a verbal submission.[63] Rousey faced Julia Budd at Strikeforce Challengers 20 on November 18, 2011, in Las Vegas.[64] She won via submission due to an armbar in the first round, dislocating Budd's elbow in the process. Following the fight, she announced plans to move down to 135 pounds to challenge Miesha Tate, the Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Champion at the time, with whom she had developed a much-publicized rivalry.[65][66] During his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Rousey's trainer Edmond Tarverdyan said that Rousey started her MMA career in the 145\u00a0lb division because she had to be able to make weight at short notice, due to the difficulty of finding willing opponents.[67] Rousey challenged Tate for her Strikeforce title on March 3, 2012, in Columbus, Ohio. She defeated Tate by submission due to an armbar in the first round, again dislocating her opponent's elbow, to become the new Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Champion.[68][69] Rousey appeared in All Access: Ronda Rousey on Showtime. The half-hour special debuted on August 8, 2012.[70] UFC President Dana White revealed during the program that \"In the next 10 years, if there's a woman in the octagon, it's probably going to be Ronda Rousey.\"[71] The second installment of the special aired on August 15, 2012.[72] Rousey also appeared on Conan.[73] Rousey defended her Strikeforce title against Sarah Kaufman at Strikeforce: Rousey vs. Kaufman on August 18, 2012, in San Diego, California.[74] Rousey said that she would throw Kaufman's arm at her corner after ripping it off with an armbar, and threatened to choke or pound Kaufman's face to death.[75] During the fight, Rousey quickly took Kaufman down and submitted her with an armbar in 54 seconds to retain the Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Championship. After the fight, Rousey announced that if former Strikeforce Women's Featherweight Champion Cristiane \"Cyborg\" Santos wanted to fight her, it would have to take place at bantamweight.[76][77][78] In November 2012, the Ultimate Fighting Championship announced that Rousey had become the first female fighter to sign with the UFC.[13][79] UFC President Dana White officially announced at the UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Diaz pre-fight press conference that Rousey was the first UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion. Rousey originally opposed using the nickname her friends gave her, \"Rowdy\", feeling it would be disrespectful to professional wrestler \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper. After meeting Piper (circa 2012 or 2013) through Gene LeBell, who helped train both of them, Piper personally gave his approval.[1] Rousey defended her title against Liz Carmouche on February 23, 2013, at UFC 157. Despite being caught in an early standing neck crank attempt from Carmouche, Rousey went on to successfully defend her Bantamweight Championship title, winning the fight at 4:49 into the first round by submission due to an armbar.[80] Carmouche dislocated Ronda Rousey's jaw during the fight.[81][82] After Cat Zingano defeated Miesha Tate at The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen Finale, Dana White announced that Zingano would be a coach of The Ultimate Fighter 18 against Rousey. On May 28, Zingano having suffered a knee injury, it was announced Miesha Tate would coach The Ultimate Fighter 18 against Rousey.[83] Rousey faced Miesha Tate, in a rematch from Strikeforce, at UFC 168 on December 28, 2013. After going past the first two rounds, with Tate surviving an armbar attempt and a triangle attempt, Rousey finally submitted Tate via armbar in the third round to retain her Bantamweight Championship.[84] In an interview with Los Angeles Daily News, Rousey said she had lost muscle during her film commitments and not been able to regain her full strength for the Tate fight.[85] It was announced at the UFC 168 post-fight press conference that Rousey would defend the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship against fellow Olympic medalist and undefeated fighter Sara McMann in the main event at UFC 170 on February 22, 2014. Rousey won the fight by TKO after knocking down McMann with a knee to the body just over a minute into the first round. This marked Rousey's first career win via a method other than armbar. The stoppage led to controversy, with some sports writers and attendants finding it premature.[86][87][88] In 2014, Rousey was named one of espnW's Impact 25.[89] On April 11, 2014, it was announced that Rousey would defend the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship against Alexis Davis in the co-main event at UFC 175 on July 5, 2014. She won the fight via knockout 16 seconds into the first round. Rousey broke her thumb during the fight.[90] The emphatic win also earned Rousey her second Performance of the Night bonus award.[91] A match between Rousey and Cat Zingano was scheduled to take place at UFC 182 for the women's bantamweight title.[92] However, the fight was moved to February 28, 2015, at UFC 184.[93] Rousey defeated Zingano with an armbar in 14 seconds, the shortest match in UFC championship history.[94] Rousey fought Bethe Correia on August 1, 2015, in Brazil, at UFC 190, winning the bout by knockout 34 seconds into the first round.[95] Rousey dedicated the match to \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, who died the day before, commenting that Piper was one of her inspirations and had endorsed her use of his nickname.[96] The bout was Rousey's sixth with the UFC, all of which had been victories. She spent 1077 seconds in the octagon to attain all six and accumulated $1,080,000 in prize money; this equated to nearly $1002.79 for every second spent fighting.[97][98] Her average time of 2 minutes and 59 seconds was less than the average time of a single match in every UFC weight class, the fastest of which was the Heavyweight division with a time of 7 minutes and 59 seconds.[99] In her seventh title defense, Rousey faced Holly Holm in the main event at UFC 193 on November 15, 2015.[100] Despite being a heavy betting favorite, Rousey was unable to get Holm to the ground and had no answer for Holm's superior striking. Early in the second round, Holm knocked Rousey out with a high kick to the neck, ending Rousey's three-year reign as champion. It was also her first loss. After the fight, Rousey and Holm were each awarded a Fight of the Night bonus of $50,000.[101] She was also medically suspended by UFC on November 18, 2015, which included a no-contact suspension for 45 days, and no fights for 60 days, and would have to depend on CT scan results to have the suspension reduced.[102] She was medically cleared on December 9, 2015.[103] After over a year away from the sport, Rousey returned to face current champion Amanda Nunes on December 30, 2016, in the main event at UFC 207.[104] She lost the fight via TKO due to punches at just 48 seconds into the first round.[105] Although she did not formally announce her retirement, when asked if she would fight MMA again by Ellen DeGeneres in 2018, Rousey replied, \"I think it's just as likely as me going back to another Olympics for judo.\"[106] She was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in July 2018. (main event and co-main event) - The New Yorker, 2014[42] In a 2012 interview[107] before her first match with Miesha Tate, Rousey said: \"When I was doing judo my main advantage was my conditioning and my pace; I used to wear people out.\" She had taken to heart a quote from Ryoko Tani to fight every five seconds as if it was the last five seconds of the match. A decorated judoka, Rousey typically grounds an opponent with hip throws and sweeps, then seeks to finish with strikes or submissions.[108][109] From top position, she usually attacks with punches from side control; in rear position, she often secures a back mount and attacks with head strikes.[110][111][112] Rousey is right-handed, but is a left-handed judoka fighting in an orthodox stance as a striker.[113] Rousey's favorite MMA fighter is Fedor Emelianenko, whose fighting style she works to emulate.[114] Rousey is well known for her skill in grappling and is particularly noted for her string of victories by armbar. Against accomplished strikers, such as Julia Budd and Sarah Kaufman, Rousey has typically brought the fight down and sought a quick submission.[109][115] Only powerful grapplers, such as Miesha Tate and Liz Carmouche, have been competitive with Rousey on the ground.[108][110] During early fights in her MMA career, Rousey mainly used striking to set up judo. She became a more proficient striker following her UFC debut, leading to her first wins by way of stoppage. While standing, Rousey normally uses jabs, knees, and overhand rights.[116][117] She seldom stood side on with a set boxing stance, but would square up to the opponent, while still generating strong striking power, especially when near the fence, or clinching opponents with the left hand to close the distance.[118] While discussing her signature armbar in an interview, Rousey noted that her judoka mother jumped on her every morning to wake her up with armbars.[119] Rousey is notable for introducing trash talking to women's MMA. In many interviews Rousey has used harsh language and openly downplayed the abilities of her opponents, which she explains as a way to generate more publicity for the sport.[120][121] Rousey is a professional wrestling fan. She, Shayna Baszler, Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir have dubbed themselves \"The Four Horsewomen,\" a play on The Four Horsemen professional wrestling stable, with the blessing of members Ric Flair and Arn Anderson.[122] The Four Horsewomen were acknowledged on camera and commentary as such, in the front row at WWE's SummerSlam event in August 2014. The group also went backstage during the event, meeting Paul Heyman, among others.[123] Rousey was interviewed by WWE.com that night; when asked if she, like Brock Lesnar, would cross over to wrestling, she replied \"You never know.\"[124] At WrestleMania 31 in March 2015, the Four Horsewomen were seated in the front row. During an in-ring argument between The Rock and The Authority (Stephanie McMahon and Triple H), McMahon slapped the Rock and ordered him to leave \"her ring\". She taunted him, saying he would not hit a woman. He left, paused and walked over to Rousey to a loud ovation. He then helped her into the ring and said that she would be happy to hit McMahon for him. After a staredown, The Rock attacked Triple H. When he stumbled toward Rousey, she tossed him out of the ring. McMahon tried to slap her, was blocked and Rousey grabbed her arm, teasing an armbar, before throwing her out of the ring. Rousey and the Rock celebrated in the ring, while the Authority retreated with the implication of revenge.[125] The segment was replayed and discussed throughout the next night's Raw with the commentators hyping a tweet Rousey made earlier that day, in which she implied a return to WWE with \"We're just gettin' started...\".[126] On July 13, 14, and September 12, 2017, the Horsewomen appeared in the audience of the Mae Young Classic to support their compatriot Shayna Baszler, who was making her WWE debut in the tournament. Additionally during the event, all four Horsewomen had a face-off with Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch, and Bayley, who, in WWE together with Sasha Banks, are also known as the Four Horsewomen, hinting at a possible future feud between the two groups.[127][128][129] It was reported in 2017 that Rousey had signed with the WWE on a full-time basis and had been training at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando. Rousey made a surprise appearance at Royal Rumble on January 28, 2018, confronting Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss, SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair, and Asuka, who had just won the inaugural women's Royal Rumble match. ESPN immediately revealed during the segment that she had signed a full\u2013time contract with WWE.[19][130][131] The jacket which Rousey wore during this appearance belonged to \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, given to her by his son.[132] On February 25 at the Elimination Chamber pay\u2013per\u2013view, Rousey was involved in an in\u2013ring altercation with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon, after which she signed her contract (in storyline), thus making her a part of the Raw brand.[133][134] On the March 5 episode of Raw, it was announced that Rousey will make her in\u2013ring debut WrestleMania 34, WWE's flagship event, in a mixed tag team match pitting Rousey and Kurt Angle as her partner against Stephanie McMahon and Triple H.[135][136] At the event, Rousey submitted McMahon with her trademark armbar submission hold to secure the win for her team.[137] Her debut performance was widely praised by both fans and wrestling critics, with Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer noting that she \"at no point looked out of her element, she was crisp in just about everything\", calling her performance \"one of the better pro wrestling debuts I've ever seen\".[138][139][140] The Washington Post noted the positive fan reaction, stating \"The match exceeded expectations, with fans firmly behind Rousey\" and \"[fans were] surprised [at her] high\u2013level coordination and quality of wrestling. Even those who were not agreed the match was entertaining.\"[141] In May, after she was challenged by then-champion Nia Jax, it was announced that Rousey would get her first opportunity at the Raw Women's Championship at the next pay\u2013per\u2013view, Money in the Bank.[142] At the event, Rousey went on to win the match by disqualification after an interference by Alexa Bliss, who attacked both Rousey and Jax and cashed in her Money in the Bank contract (which she won earlier that night) to win the title instead.[143][144] For her first singles match and title opportunity, she was once again praised by fans and critics for her performance, with CNET stating \"For the first time, [WWE's] biggest mainstream star is a woman.\"[145][146] They believed that despite \"worry was that the match would expose Rousey's own inexperience, which would greatly damage her aura and star power\", she \"came across as a formidable, believable star wrestler. The match was good, but she was awesome\".[145] Throughout the next two months, Rousey would start her first feud as part of WWE with Alexa Bliss over the title, which included a suspension (again in kayfabe) after Rousey attacked Bliss, Kurt Angle and multiple officials.[147][148] After honouring her suspension from in\u2013ring competition, Rousey received a Raw Women's Championship match by Raw General Manager Kurt Angle against Bliss at SummerSlam.[149] At the event on August 19, Rousey squashed Bliss to win the title, her first championship win in WWE.[150] In a rematch between the two that took place a month later on September 16 at Hell in a Cell, Rousey once again submitted Bliss.[151] Throughout her championship reign, Rousey went on to fend off title contenders such as Nikki Bella (in the main event of the first all women's pay\u2013per\u2013view Evolution),[152][153][154] Mickie James,[155] Nia Jax,[156][157] Natalya[158][159] and Sasha Banks.[160][161][162][163] In November, Rousey was supposed to face Becky Lynch at the Survivor Series pay\u2013per\u2013view in an interbrand champion vs. champion match, however, Lynch was legitimately injured during an invasion angle just minutes after she attacked Rousey backstage.[164] At the event, Rousey faced Charlotte Flair instead, and won via disqualification after Flair attacked her with a kendo stick and steel chairs.[165] A month later, on December 16, at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, Rousey gained revenge against both Flair and Lynch as she pushed them off a ladder during their match, also helping Asuka win the SmackDown Women's Championship.[166] Shortly after she retained her title against Bayley, on the January 28, 2019, episode of Raw, Rousey continued her feud with Becky Lynch (who had won the Royal Rumble match) after the latter chose to challenge her in a title match at WrestleMania 35.[167][168][169][170] On the February 11 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon suspended Lynch for 60 days in storyline and announced Charlotte Flair replaced Lynch as Rousey's WrestleMania opponent.[171] On the March 4 episode of Raw, Rousey turned heel for the first time in her career when she cut a promo on fans and attacked both Flair and Lynch.[172] At Fastlane, Lynch faced Flair in a match where if Lynch won, she would be inserted back into the Raw Women's Championship match at WrestleMania. Rousey attacked Lynch during the match, giving Lynch the disqualification victory and thus the WrestleMania triple-threat match between Rousey, Flair and Lynch was made official. On March 25, WWE announced Rousey's title defense against Lynch and Flair would be the main event of WrestleMania 35, making it the first women's match to close WrestleMania.[173] At the event, in what was changed to a Winner takes all for Rousey's Raw and Flair's SmackDown Women's Championships, Lynch controversially pinned Rousey to win both titles. The commentary and production team commented that Rousey was in the ring saying her shoulders were not down for the full three-count and showed a replay of the ending pin-pointing this fact. Many fans and media were left wondering if this was a legitimate botched finish or if it was booked to end that way.[174][175] Nonetheless, this gave Rousey her first loss in WWE and ended her championship reign at 231 days, making her the now-second-longest-reigning Raw Women's Champion.[176] Rousey appeared nude on the cover of ESPN The Magazine's 2012 Body Issue and in a pictorial therein.[177] In May 2013, Rousey was ranked 29 on the Maxim Hot 100.[178] She also appeared on the cover and in a pictorial of the September 2013 issue. During her Maxim interview she stated that she is unbelievably ticklish and goes ninja when people try to tickle her. Also, sharing that she used to be pinned down, tickled by friends and siblings when she was younger. Previously, while on Conan O'Brien, showing off her ESPN cover and going over MMA rules, being playful, she mentioned her weakness, that she is extremely ticklish. Rousey co-starred in The Expendables 3 (2014), marking her first role in a major motion picture.[20] In 2015, she appeared in the film Furious 7, and played herself in the film Entourage.[21][179] In 2015, Rousey became the first woman featured on the cover of Australian Men's Fitness, appearing on their November edition.[180] In October 2015, Rousey became the first female athlete to guest host ESPN's SportsCenter.[181] Rousey was on the cover of the January 2016 issue for The Ring magazine. She became the first mixed martial artist to ever appear on the cover of the boxing magazine and the second woman as well, after Cathy Davis in 1978.[182] In February 2016 she appeared in body paint as one of three cover athletes on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.[183] Rousey has had a range of commercial partnerships, including mobile network operator MetroPCS,[184] insurance agency Insureon,[185] Reebok,[186] and Carl's Jr.[187] Rousey hosted the January 23, 2016, episode of the late night variety show Saturday Night Live, with musical guest Selena Gomez.[188][189] Rousey appeared in the Season 2, Episode 20 episode of Blindspot playing the role of Devon Penberthy, a prison inmate serving time for transporting weapons across state lines.[190] A number of starring film roles have been developed for Rousey, including an adaptation of her autobiography My Fight / Your Fight at Paramount,[191] The Athena Project at Warner Bros.,[191] the Peter Berg-directed action film Mile 22.[192] Rousey was scheduled to star in a remake of the 1989 Patrick Swayze action drama Road House. Road House would have marked her biggest acting job to date. According to Variety, Rousey reached out to Swayze's widow, Lisa Niemi, to ask for her blessing, which Niemi gave.[193] However, the Road House project was cancelled in 2016.[194] On July 9, 2018, Rousey was confirmed as one of the two pre-order bonus characters for the video game WWE 2K19 (the other being wrestling veteran Rey Mysterio).[195][196] She previously appeared in EA Sports UFC, EA Sports UFC 2 and EA Sports UFC 3.[197] On January 17, 2019, it was confirmed that Rousey would be voicing Sonya Blade in the video game Mortal Kombat 11.[198] On August 18, 2019, it was revealed that Rousey is appearing as a recurring character Lena Bosko in the third season of FOX's 9-1-1 series.[199] During her first day of shooting, she injured two fingers after her left hand was jammed in a boat door. The tip of her ring finger was fractured while her middle finger was broken with the tendon nearly severed. Rousey was rushed to the hospital, where her middle finger was mended with a metal plate and screws.[200] As of 2017, Rousey lives in Venice, California.[201] Rousey became a vegan after Beijing 2008,[202][203] but in 2012 described her diet as \"kind of a mix between a Paleo and a Warrior diet\", trying to eat everything organic.[204] Rousey has discussed how she struggled with her body image in the past. She explained, \"When I was in school, martial arts made you a dork, and I became self-conscious that I was too masculine. I was a 16-year-old girl with ringworm and cauliflower ears. People made fun of my arms and called me 'Miss Man'. It wasn't until I got older that I realized: these people are idiots. I'm fabulous.\"[205] Rousey is an avid fan of Dragon Ball Z and Pok\u00e9mon. Her favorite Pok\u00e9mon is Mew and she had a childhood crush on Vegeta.[206] Christopher Sabat, the English voice actor of Vegeta, jokingly replied in an interview, \"She has seen my power level for what it is\u2026 She also scares me.\"[207] She also plays World of Warcraft, primarily as a night elf hunter.[208] In 2015, she raised money by auctioning signed T-shirts for the Black Jaguar-White Tiger Foundation, whose goal is to save big cats from circuses and zoos and provide them with the best lifestyle.[209] In April 2015, Rousey visited Yerevan, Armenia for the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. While in Yerevan, she visited the Tsitsernakaberd Armenian Genocide memorial.[210] Rousey endorsed Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign in the 2016 United States presidential election.[211][212] In February 2016, in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres Rousey admitted that suicidal thoughts went through her mind in the aftermath of her knockout loss to Holly Holm in November 2015.[213] Rousey once dated fellow UFC fighter Brendan Schaub.[214] In August 2015, Rousey was rumored to be in a relationship with UFC fighter Travis Browne, who knocked out Schaub in a bout the previous year, after a picture of the two together appeared on Twitter and Browne's estranged wife Jenna Renee Webb accused the two of seeing one another. Browne was at the time still married and under investigation by the UFC after Webb publicly accused him of domestic violence back in July.[215] Browne confirmed he and Rousey were together in October 2015.[216] The next day, Rousey revealed that she was dating Browne.[217] Rousey and Browne got engaged on April 20, 2017, in New Zealand[218] and married on August 28, 2017 in Browne's home state of Hawaii.[219] She is stepmother to Browne's two sons. In her autobiography, My Fight, Your Fight, Rousey wrote of an incident with an ex-boyfriend she dubbed \"Snappers McCreepy\" after she discovered that he had taken nude photos of her without her consent or knowledge, two weeks before her first fight with Miesha Tate. When a seething Rousey met him, she \"slapped him across the face so hard [her] hand hurt.\" According to Rousey, he then refused to let her leave as he was trying to explain, so she attacked his face with two punches, one more slap, one knee, then \"tossed him aside on the kitchen floor.\" She went to her car and he followed, grabbing the steering wheel, so she \"dragged him out onto the sidewalk, and left him writhing there\". Rousey deleted the photos and erased his hard drive, however fear that the pictures may still be out there influenced her to pose for ESPN magazine's Body Issue so that nude pictures of her would be seen on her own terms.[220][221][222][223] Rousey faced some criticism that she had committed domestic abuse.[224]",

She is currently signed to WWE as a wrestler.[12] Her longstanding nickname, \"Rowdy\", was inherited from late professional wrestler Roddy Piper.[1]\nAfter becoming the first American woman to earn an Olympic medal in judo by winning bronze at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Rousey began pursuing a career in mixed martial arts (MMA). She won her MMA debut for King of the Cage before going to Strikeforce, where she became the last-ever Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Champion before the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bought Strikeforce in 2011.[13] She was their inaugural female champion when she was named UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion. Rousey took part in the first women's fight in UFC history when she successfully defended her title against Liz Carmouche at UFC 157. After setting the record for most UFC title defenses by a woman (6), Rousey had her first professional loss in MMA when she lost her title to Holly Holm.[14][15][16][17] In 2018, she became the first female fighter to be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame.[18]\nIn 2018, Rousey began a career in professional wrestling, signing a contract with WWE.[19] She debuted at WrestleMania 34, and later won the Raw Women's Championship, her first WWE and professional wrestling title, at SummerSlam. She then headlined the inaugural WWE all-women's pay-per-view event when she successfully defended her title against Nikki Bella at WWE Evolution. Rousey had her first WWE loss when she lost her title in the first-ever women's WrestleMania main-event to Becky Lynch in a triple threat match at WrestleMania 35; this left her reign as Raw Women's Champion as the second-longest in the title's history at 231 days.\nRousey has also enjoyed success as an actress and author, appearing in the films The Expendables 3 (2014),[20] Furious 7 (2015),[21] and Mile 22 (2018),[22] and releasing her autobiography My Fight / Your Fight in 2015.[23]\nRousey is the only woman to win a championship in both the UFC and WWE, as well as the only woman to headline a pay-per-view event in both companies.[24] Rousey was voted the best female athlete of all-time in a 2015 ESPN fan poll, and Fox Sports described her as \"one of the defining athletes of the 21st century.\"[25][26][27][28]\nRonda Jean Rousey was born in Riverside, California[29] on February 1, 1987, the youngest of three daughters of AnnMaria De Mars (n\u00e9e Waddell) and Ron Rousey,[30] after whom she was named.[31] Her mother, a decorated judoka, was the first American to win a World Judo Championship (in 1984). Rousey is of English, Polish, Trinidadian, and Venezuelan ancestry.[32] Her Venezuelan maternal grandfather was partly of Afro-Venezuelan descent and her Trinidadian maternal great-grandfather, Alfred E Waddell, was a doctor who emigrated to Canada and became one of the first black physicians in North America.[33][34][35] Her stepfather is an aerospace engineer.[36] Her biological father, after breaking his back sledding with his daughters and learning that he would be a paraplegic, committed suicide in 1995 when Rousey was eight.[31][37] AnnMaria pursued a Ph.D. in educational psychology at the University of California, Riverside as her daughters grew up.[31][38]\nFor the first six years of her life, Rousey struggled with speech and could not form an intelligible sentence due to apraxia, a neurological childhood speech sound disorder.[39] This speech disorder was attributed to being born with her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck. When Rousey was three years old, her mother and father moved from Riverside, California, to Jamestown, North Dakota, to obtain intensive speech therapy with specialists at Minot State University.[40][41] Rousey dropped out of high school and later earned her GED.[42] She was raised between Jamestown and Southern California, retiring from her judo career at 21 and starting her MMA career at 22 when she realized that she did not want to spend her life in a conventional field of work.[43]\nRousey began judo with her mother at the age of 11. Rousey trained with her mother until she was 13, when she accidentally broke her mother's wrist.[44] At 17, Rousey was the youngest judoka to qualify for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Rousey lost in her first match to silver medalist Claudia Heill in the 63\u00a0kg bracket. Also in 2004, Rousey won a gold medal at the World Junior Judo Championships in Budapest, Hungary.\nIn April 2006, she became the first female U.S. judoka in nearly 10 years to win an A-Level tournament as she went 5-0 to claim gold at the Birmingham World Cup in Great Britain. Later that year, the 19-year-old won the bronze medal at the Junior World Championships, becoming the first U.S. athlete to win two Junior World medals.[45]\nIn February 2007, Rousey moved up to 70\u00a0kg where she ranked as one of the top three women in the world. She won the silver medal at the 2007 World Judo Championships in the middleweight division and the gold medal at the 2007 Pan American Games.[46]\nIn August 2008, Rousey competed at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. She lost her quarterfinal to the Dutch ex-world champion Edith Bosch but qualified for a bronze medal match through the repechage bracket. Rousey defeated Annett Boehm by Yuko to win a bronze medal (Judo offers two bronze medals per weight class.) With the victory, Rousey became the first American to win an Olympic medal in women's judo since its inception as an Olympic sport in 1992.[47][48]\nRousey retired from judo at 21 after the Olympics. After winning her Olympic medal, Rousey shared a studio apartment with a roommate in Venice Beach, California and worked three jobs as a bartender and cocktail waitress to support herself and her dog.[49]\nWhen Rousey started learning judo, her mother took her to judo clubs run by her old teammates. Rousey went to Hayastan MMA Academy, which was run by Gokor Chivichyan, where she trained with fellow future MMA fighters Manny Gamburyan and Karo Parisyan. According to Rousey, Hayastan practiced \"a more brawling style of judo versus the more technical Japanese style.\" Rousey trained mostly with males bigger than she was and often got frustrated and cried when she got thrown and could not throw somebody. \"Probably from 2002 to 2005 I cried every single night of training,\" Rousey remarked.[44]\nRousey trained closely with Gamburyan. After injuring her knee when she was 16, Gamburyan volunteered to open the gym every afternoon and work with her personally. Back in 2004, her teammates thought Rousey \"would kill these girls\" in MMA, but also thought she was \"too pretty to get hit in the face\" and should keep doing judo. While Gamburyan and Parisyan went into MMA, Rousey stuck with judo but remained in touch with MMA through them. The first MMA fight she took an interest in watching was Manny Gamburyan versus Nate Diaz in The Ultimate Fighter finale. Rousey stated she never got as excited watching judo or any other sport. After the 2008 Olympics the following year, she decided to start MMA through Team Hayastan.[44]\nRousey also trained at the Glendale Fighting Club, to which she was introduced by Gamburyan and other Hayastan teammates. She started training under her long-term MMA coach Edmond Tarverdyan at GFC.[50]\nShe trained in Jiu Jitsu at Dynamix MMA with Henry Akins from 2011 to 2014[51] and went on to train with Ryron Graice and Rener Gracie of Gracie Academy,[52] as well as BJ Penn of Art of Jiu Jitsu.[53]\nRousey made her mixed martial arts debut as an amateur on August 6, 2010. She defeated Hayden Munoz by submission due to an armbar in 23 seconds.[54]\nShe entered the quarterfinals of the Tuff-N-Uff 145\u00a0lbs women's tournament on November 12, 2010, and submitted promotional veteran Autumn Richardson with an armbar in 57 seconds.[55]\nRousey faced Taylor Stratford in the Tuff-N-Uff tournament semi-finals on January 7, 2011, and won by technical submission due to an armbar in 24 seconds. She then announced plans to turn pro and was replaced in the tournament.[56] Rousey has a 3-0 record in amateur MMA competition, and the combined duration of all her amateur fights is under 2 minutes.[43]\nRousey made her professional mixed martial arts debut on March 27, 2011, at King of the Cage: Turning Point. She submitted Ediane Gomes with an armbar in 25 seconds.[54][57]\nRousey faced kickboxing champion Charmaine Tweet in an MMA bout at Hard Knocks Fighting Championship: School of Hard Knocks 12 on June 17, 2011, in Calgary, Canada.[58] She submitted Tweet with an armbar in 49 seconds.[59][60]\nRousey was scheduled to make her Strikeforce debut against Sarah D'Alelio on July 30, 2011, at Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Henderson in Hoffman Estates, Illinois.[61] The fight was postponed and eventually took place on the Strikeforce Challengers 18 main card on August 12, 2011, in Las Vegas, Nevada.[62] Rousey defeated D'Alelio by technical submission due to an armbar early in the first round. The victory was controversial. Rousey claimed that D'Alelio yelled \"tap\" more than once and that D'Alelio denied this and claimed to have yelled \"Aaaahhh\". According to the unified rules of mixed martial arts, either one of these utterances would still be a verbal submission.[63]\nRousey faced Julia Budd at Strikeforce Challengers 20 on November 18, 2011, in Las Vegas.[64] She won via submission due to an armbar in the first round, dislocating Budd's elbow in the process. Following the fight, she announced plans to move down to 135 pounds to challenge Miesha Tate, the Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Champion at the time, with whom she had developed a much-publicized rivalry.[65][66]\nDuring his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Rousey's trainer Edmond Tarverdyan said that Rousey started her MMA career in the 145\u00a0lb division because she had to be able to make weight at short notice, due to the difficulty of finding willing opponents.[67]\nRousey challenged Tate for her Strikeforce title on March 3, 2012, in Columbus, Ohio. She defeated Tate by submission due to an armbar in the first round, again dislocating her opponent's elbow, to become the new Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Champion.[68][69]\nRousey appeared in All Access: Ronda Rousey on Showtime. The half-hour special debuted on August 8, 2012.[70] UFC President Dana White revealed during the program that \"In the next 10 years, if there's a woman in the octagon, it's probably going to be Ronda Rousey.\"[71] The second installment of the special aired on August 15, 2012.[72] Rousey also appeared on Conan.[73]\nRousey defended her Strikeforce title against Sarah Kaufman at Strikeforce: Rousey vs. Kaufman on August 18, 2012, in San Diego, California.[74] Rousey said that she would throw Kaufman's arm at her corner after ripping it off with an armbar, and threatened to choke or pound Kaufman's face to death.[75] During the fight, Rousey quickly took Kaufman down and submitted her with an armbar in 54 seconds to retain the Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Championship. After the fight, Rousey announced that if former Strikeforce Women's Featherweight Champion Cristiane \"Cyborg\" Santos wanted to fight her, it would have to take place at bantamweight.[76][77][78]\nIn November 2012, the Ultimate Fighting Championship announced that Rousey had become the first female fighter to sign with the UFC.[13][79] UFC President Dana White officially announced at the UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Diaz pre-fight press conference that Rousey was the first UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion.\nRousey originally opposed using the nickname her friends gave her, \"Rowdy\", feeling it would be disrespectful to professional wrestler \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper. After meeting Piper (circa 2012 or 2013) through Gene LeBell, who helped train both of them, Piper personally gave his approval.[1]\nRousey defended her title against Liz Carmouche on February 23, 2013, at UFC 157. Despite being caught in an early standing neck crank attempt from Carmouche, Rousey went on to successfully defend her Bantamweight Championship title, winning the fight at 4:49 into the first round by submission due to an armbar.[80] Carmouche dislocated Ronda Rousey's jaw during the fight.[81][82]\nAfter Cat Zingano defeated Miesha Tate at The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen Finale, Dana White announced that Zingano would be a coach of The Ultimate Fighter 18 against Rousey. On May 28, Zingano having suffered a knee injury, it was announced Miesha Tate would coach The Ultimate Fighter 18 against Rousey.[83]\nRousey faced Miesha Tate, in a rematch from Strikeforce, at UFC 168 on December 28, 2013. After going past the first two rounds, with Tate surviving an armbar attempt and a triangle attempt, Rousey finally submitted Tate via armbar in the third round to retain her Bantamweight Championship.[84] In an interview with Los Angeles Daily News, Rousey said she had lost muscle during her film commitments and not been able to regain her full strength for the Tate fight.[85]\nIt was announced at the UFC 168 post-fight press conference that Rousey would defend the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship against fellow Olympic medalist and undefeated fighter Sara McMann in the main event at UFC 170 on February 22, 2014. Rousey won the fight by TKO after knocking down McMann with a knee to the body just over a minute into the first round. This marked Rousey's first career win via a method other than armbar. The stoppage led to controversy, with some sports writers and attendants finding it premature.[86][87][88]\nIn 2014, Rousey was named one of espnW's Impact 25.[89]\nOn April 11, 2014, it was announced that Rousey would defend the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship against Alexis Davis in the co-main event at UFC 175 on July 5, 2014. She won the fight via knockout 16 seconds into the first round. Rousey broke her thumb during the fight.[90] The emphatic win also earned Rousey her second Performance of the Night bonus award.[91]\nA match between Rousey and Cat Zingano was scheduled to take place at UFC 182 for the women's bantamweight title.[92] However, the fight was moved to February 28, 2015, at UFC 184.[93] Rousey defeated Zingano with an armbar in 14 seconds, the shortest match in UFC championship history.[94]\nRousey fought Bethe Correia on August 1, 2015, in Brazil, at UFC 190, winning the bout by knockout 34 seconds into the first round.[95] Rousey dedicated the match to \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, who died the day before, commenting that Piper was one of her inspirations and had endorsed her use of his nickname.[96]\nThe bout was Rousey's sixth with the UFC, all of which had been victories. She spent 1077 seconds in the octagon to attain all six and accumulated $1,080,000 in prize money; this equated to nearly $1002.79 for every second spent fighting.[97][98] Her average time of 2 minutes and 59 seconds was less than the average time of a single match in every UFC weight class, the fastest of which was the Heavyweight division with a time of 7 minutes and 59 seconds.[99]\nIn her seventh title defense, Rousey faced Holly Holm in the main event at UFC 193 on November 15, 2015.[100] Despite being a heavy betting favorite, Rousey was unable to get Holm to the ground and had no answer for Holm's superior striking. Early in the second round, Holm knocked Rousey out with a high kick to the neck, ending Rousey's three-year reign as champion. It was also her first loss. After the fight, Rousey and Holm were each awarded a Fight of the Night bonus of $50,000.[101] She was also medically suspended by UFC on November 18, 2015, which included a no-contact suspension for 45 days, and no fights for 60 days, and would have to depend on CT scan results to have the suspension reduced.[102] She was medically cleared on December 9, 2015.[103]\nAfter over a year away from the sport, Rousey returned to face current champion Amanda Nunes on December 30, 2016, in the main event at UFC 207.[104] She lost the fight via TKO due to punches at just 48 seconds into the first round.[105]\nAlthough she did not formally announce her retirement, when asked if she would fight MMA again by Ellen DeGeneres in 2018, Rousey replied, \"I think it's just as likely as me going back to another Olympics for judo.\"[106] She was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in July 2018.\n(main event and co-main event)\n- The New Yorker, 2014[42]\nIn a 2012 interview[107] before her first match with Miesha Tate, Rousey said: \"When I was doing judo my main advantage was my conditioning and my pace; I used to wear people out.\" She had taken to heart a quote from Ryoko Tani to fight every five seconds as if it was the last five seconds of the match.\nA decorated judoka, Rousey typically grounds an opponent with hip throws and sweeps, then seeks to finish with strikes or submissions.[108][109] From top position, she usually attacks with punches from side control; in rear position, she often secures a back mount and attacks with head strikes.[110][111][112] Rousey is right-handed, but is a left-handed judoka fighting in an orthodox stance as a striker.[113]\nRousey's favorite MMA fighter is Fedor Emelianenko, whose fighting style she works to emulate.[114]\nRousey is well known for her skill in grappling and is particularly noted for her string of victories by armbar. Against accomplished strikers, such as Julia Budd and Sarah Kaufman, Rousey has typically brought the fight down and sought a quick submission.[109][115] Only powerful grapplers, such as Miesha Tate and Liz Carmouche, have been competitive with Rousey on the ground.[108][110]\nDuring early fights in her MMA career, Rousey mainly used striking to set up judo. She became a more proficient striker following her UFC debut, leading to her first wins by way of stoppage. While standing, Rousey normally uses jabs, knees, and overhand rights.[116][117] She seldom stood side on with a set boxing stance, but would square up to the opponent, while still generating strong striking power, especially when near the fence, or clinching opponents with the left hand to close the distance.[118]\nWhile discussing her signature armbar in an interview, Rousey noted that her judoka mother jumped on her every morning to wake her up with armbars.[119]\nRousey is notable for introducing trash talking to women's MMA. In many interviews Rousey has used harsh language and openly downplayed the abilities of her opponents, which she explains as a way to generate more publicity for the sport.[120][121]\nRousey is a professional wrestling fan. She, Shayna Baszler, Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir have dubbed themselves \"The Four Horsewomen,\" a play on The Four Horsemen professional wrestling stable, with the blessing of members Ric Flair and Arn Anderson.[122]\nThe Four Horsewomen were acknowledged on camera and commentary as such, in the front row at WWE's SummerSlam event in August 2014. The group also went backstage during the event, meeting Paul Heyman, among others.[123] Rousey was interviewed by WWE.com that night; when asked if she, like Brock Lesnar, would cross over to wrestling, she replied \"You never know.\"[124]\nAt WrestleMania 31 in March 2015, the Four Horsewomen were seated in the front row. During an in-ring argument between The Rock and The Authority (Stephanie McMahon and Triple H), McMahon slapped the Rock and ordered him to leave \"her ring\". She taunted him, saying he would not hit a woman. He left, paused and walked over to Rousey to a loud ovation. He then helped her into the ring and said that she would be happy to hit McMahon for him. After a staredown, The Rock attacked Triple H. When he stumbled toward Rousey, she tossed him out of the ring. McMahon tried to slap her, was blocked and Rousey grabbed her arm, teasing an armbar, before throwing her out of the ring. Rousey and the Rock celebrated in the ring, while the Authority retreated with the implication of revenge.[125] The segment was replayed and discussed throughout the next night's Raw with the commentators hyping a tweet Rousey made earlier that day, in which she implied a return to WWE with \"We're just gettin' started...\".[126]\nOn July 13, 14, and September 12, 2017, the Horsewomen appeared in the audience of the Mae Young Classic to support their compatriot Shayna Baszler, who was making her WWE debut in the tournament. Additionally during the event, all four Horsewomen had a face-off with Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch, and Bayley, who, in WWE together with Sasha Banks, are also known as the Four Horsewomen, hinting at a possible future feud between the two groups.[127][128][129]\nIt was reported in 2017 that Rousey had signed with the WWE on a full-time basis and had been training at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando.\nRousey made a surprise appearance at Royal Rumble on January 28, 2018, confronting Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss, SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair, and Asuka, who had just won the inaugural women's Royal Rumble match. ESPN immediately revealed during the segment that she had signed a full\u2013time contract with WWE.[19][130][131] The jacket which Rousey wore during this appearance belonged to \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, given to her by his son.[132] On February 25 at the Elimination Chamber pay\u2013per\u2013view, Rousey was involved in an in\u2013ring altercation with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon, after which she signed her contract (in storyline), thus making her a part of the Raw brand.[133][134]\nOn the March 5 episode of Raw, it was announced that Rousey will make her in\u2013ring debut WrestleMania 34, WWE's flagship event, in a mixed tag team match pitting Rousey and Kurt Angle as her partner against Stephanie McMahon and Triple H.[135][136] At the event, Rousey submitted McMahon with her trademark armbar submission hold to secure the win for her team.[137] Her debut performance was widely praised by both fans and wrestling critics, with Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer noting that she \"at no point looked out of her element, she was crisp in just about everything\", calling her performance \"one of the better pro wrestling debuts I've ever seen\".[138][139][140] The Washington Post noted the positive fan reaction, stating \"The match exceeded expectations, with fans firmly behind Rousey\" and \"[fans were] surprised [at her] high\u2013level coordination and quality of wrestling. Even those who were not agreed the match was entertaining.\"[141]\nIn May, after she was challenged by then-champion Nia Jax, it was announced that Rousey would get her first opportunity at the Raw Women's Championship at the next pay\u2013per\u2013view, Money in the Bank.[142] At the event, Rousey went on to win the match by disqualification after an interference by Alexa Bliss, who attacked both Rousey and Jax and cashed in her Money in the Bank contract (which she won earlier that night) to win the title instead.[143][144] For her first singles match and title opportunity, she was once again praised by fans and critics for her performance, with CNET stating \"For the first time, [WWE's] biggest mainstream star is a woman.\"[145][146] They believed that despite \"worry was that the match would expose Rousey's own inexperience, which would greatly damage her aura and star power\", she \"came across as a formidable, believable star wrestler. The match was good, but she was awesome\".[145] Throughout the next two months, Rousey would start her first feud as part of WWE with Alexa Bliss over the title, which included a suspension (again in kayfabe) after Rousey attacked Bliss, Kurt Angle and multiple officials.[147][148] After honouring her suspension from in\u2013ring competition, Rousey received a Raw Women's Championship match by Raw General Manager Kurt Angle against Bliss at SummerSlam.[149] At the event on August 19, Rousey squashed Bliss to win the title, her first championship win in WWE.[150] In a rematch between the two that took place a month later on September 16 at Hell in a Cell, Rousey once again submitted Bliss.[151]\nThroughout her championship reign, Rousey went on to fend off title contenders such as Nikki Bella (in the main event of the first all women's pay\u2013per\u2013view Evolution),[152][153][154] Mickie James,[155] Nia Jax,[156][157] Natalya[158][159] and Sasha Banks.[160][161][162][163] In November, Rousey was supposed to face Becky Lynch at the Survivor Series pay\u2013per\u2013view in an interbrand champion vs. champion match, however, Lynch was legitimately injured during an invasion angle just minutes after she attacked Rousey backstage.[164] At the event, Rousey faced Charlotte Flair instead, and won via disqualification after Flair attacked her with a kendo stick and steel chairs.[165] A month later, on December 16, at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs, Rousey gained revenge against both Flair and Lynch as she pushed them off a ladder during their match, also helping Asuka win the SmackDown Women's Championship.[166] Shortly after she retained her title against Bayley, on the January 28, 2019, episode of Raw, Rousey continued her feud with Becky Lynch (who had won the Royal Rumble match) after the latter chose to challenge her in a title match at WrestleMania 35.[167][168][169][170] On the February 11 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon suspended Lynch for 60 days in storyline and announced Charlotte Flair replaced Lynch as Rousey's WrestleMania opponent.[171] On the March 4 episode of Raw, Rousey turned heel for the first time in her career when she cut a promo on fans and attacked both Flair and Lynch.[172] At Fastlane, Lynch faced Flair in a match where if Lynch won, she would be inserted back into the Raw Women's Championship match at WrestleMania. Rousey attacked Lynch during the match, giving Lynch the disqualification victory and thus the WrestleMania triple-threat match between Rousey, Flair and Lynch was made official. On March 25, WWE announced Rousey's title defense against Lynch and Flair would be the main event of WrestleMania 35, making it the first women's match to close WrestleMania.[173] At the event, in what was changed to a Winner takes all for Rousey's Raw and Flair's SmackDown Women's Championships, Lynch controversially pinned Rousey to win both titles. The commentary and production team commented that Rousey was in the ring saying her shoulders were not down for the full three-count and showed a replay of the ending pin-pointing this fact. Many fans and media were left wondering if this was a legitimate botched finish or if it was booked to end that way.[174][175] Nonetheless, this gave Rousey her first loss in WWE and ended her championship reign at 231 days, making her the now-second-longest-reigning Raw Women's Champion.[176]\nRousey appeared nude on the cover of ESPN The Magazine's 2012 Body Issue and in a pictorial therein.[177] \nIn May 2013, Rousey was ranked 29 on the Maxim Hot 100.[178] She also appeared on the cover and in a pictorial of the September 2013 issue. During her Maxim interview she stated that she is unbelievably ticklish and goes ninja when people try to tickle her. Also, sharing that she used to be pinned down, tickled by friends and siblings when she was younger. Previously, while on Conan O'Brien, showing off her ESPN cover and going over MMA rules, being playful, she mentioned her weakness, that she is extremely ticklish.\nRousey co-starred in The Expendables 3 (2014), marking her first role in a major motion picture.[20] In 2015, she appeared in the film Furious 7, and played herself in the film Entourage.[21][179]\nIn 2015, Rousey became the first woman featured on the cover of Australian Men's Fitness, appearing on their November edition.[180]\nIn October 2015, Rousey became the first female athlete to guest host ESPN's SportsCenter.[181]\nRousey was on the cover of the January 2016 issue for The Ring magazine. She became the first mixed martial artist to ever appear on the cover of the boxing magazine and the second woman as well, after Cathy Davis in 1978.[182] In February 2016 she appeared in body paint as one of three cover athletes on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.[183]\nRousey has had a range of commercial partnerships, including mobile network operator MetroPCS,[184] insurance agency Insureon,[185] Reebok,[186] and Carl's Jr.[187]\nRousey hosted the January 23, 2016, episode of the late night variety show Saturday Night Live, with musical guest Selena Gomez.[188][189]\nRousey appeared in the Season 2, Episode 20 episode of Blindspot playing the role of Devon Penberthy, a prison inmate serving time for transporting weapons across state lines.[190]\nA number of starring film roles have been developed for Rousey, including an adaptation of her autobiography My Fight / Your Fight at Paramount,[191] The Athena Project at Warner Bros.,[191] the Peter Berg-directed action film Mile 22.[192] Rousey was scheduled to star in a remake of the 1989 Patrick Swayze action drama Road House. Road House would have marked her biggest acting job to date. According to Variety, Rousey reached out to Swayze's widow, Lisa Niemi, to ask for her blessing, which Niemi gave.[193] However, the Road House project was cancelled in 2016.[194]\nOn July 9, 2018, Rousey was confirmed as one of the two pre-order bonus characters for the video game WWE 2K19 (the other being wrestling veteran Rey Mysterio).[195][196] She previously appeared in EA Sports UFC, EA Sports UFC 2 and EA Sports UFC 3.[197]\nOn January 17, 2019, it was confirmed that Rousey would be voicing Sonya Blade in the video game Mortal Kombat 11.[198]\nOn August 18, 2019, it was revealed that Rousey is appearing as a recurring character Lena Bosko in the third season of FOX's 9-1-1 series.[199] During her first day of shooting, she injured two fingers after her left hand was jammed in a boat door. The tip of her ring finger was fractured while her middle finger was broken with the tendon nearly severed. Rousey was rushed to the hospital, where her middle finger was mended with a metal plate and screws.[200]\nAs of 2017, Rousey lives in Venice, California.[201]\nRousey became a vegan after Beijing 2008,[202][203] but in 2012 described her diet as \"kind of a mix between a Paleo and a Warrior diet\", trying to eat everything organic.[204]\nRousey has discussed how she struggled with her body image in the past. She explained, \"When I was in school, martial arts made you a dork, and I became self-conscious that I was too masculine. I was a 16-year-old girl with ringworm and cauliflower ears. People made fun of my arms and called me 'Miss Man'. It wasn't until I got older that I realized: these people are idiots. I'm fabulous.\"[205]\nRousey is an avid fan of Dragon Ball Z and Pok\u00e9mon. Her favorite Pok\u00e9mon is Mew and she had a childhood crush on Vegeta.[206] Christopher Sabat, the English voice actor of Vegeta, jokingly replied in an interview, \"She has seen my power level for what it is\u2026 She also scares me.\"[207] She also plays World of Warcraft, primarily as a night elf hunter.[208]\nIn 2015, she raised money by auctioning signed T-shirts for the Black Jaguar-White Tiger Foundation, whose goal is to save big cats from circuses and zoos and provide them with the best lifestyle.[209]\nIn April 2015, Rousey visited Yerevan, Armenia for the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. While in Yerevan, she visited the Tsitsernakaberd Armenian Genocide memorial.[210]\nRousey endorsed Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign in the 2016 United States presidential election.[211][212]\nIn February 2016, in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres Rousey admitted that suicidal thoughts went through her mind in the aftermath of her knockout loss to Holly Holm in November 2015.[213]\nRousey once dated fellow UFC fighter Brendan Schaub.[214] In August 2015, Rousey was rumored to be in a relationship with UFC fighter Travis Browne, who knocked out Schaub in a bout the previous year, after a picture of the two together appeared on Twitter and Browne's estranged wife Jenna Renee Webb accused the two of seeing one another. Browne was at the time still married and under investigation by the UFC after Webb publicly accused him of domestic violence back in July.[215] Browne confirmed he and Rousey were together in October 2015.[216] The next day, Rousey revealed that she was dating Browne.[217]\nRousey and Browne got engaged on April 20, 2017, in New Zealand[218] and married on August 28, 2017 in Browne's home state of Hawaii.[219] She is stepmother to Browne's two sons.\nIn her autobiography, My Fight, Your Fight, Rousey wrote of an incident with an ex-boyfriend she dubbed \"Snappers McCreepy\" after she discovered that he had taken nude photos of her without her consent or knowledge, two weeks before her first fight with Miesha Tate. When a seething Rousey met him, she \"slapped him across the face so hard [her] hand hurt.\" According to Rousey, he then refused to let her leave as he was trying to explain, so she attacked his face with two punches, one more slap, one knee, then \"tossed him aside on the kitchen floor.\" She went to her car and he followed, grabbing the steering wheel, so she \"dragged him out onto the sidewalk, and left him writhing there\". Rousey deleted the photos and erased his hard drive, however fear that the pictures may still be out there influenced her to pose for ESPN magazine's Body Issue so that nude pictures of her would be seen on her own terms.[220][221][222][223] Rousey faced some criticism that she had committed domestic abuse.[224]\n</body></html>"
